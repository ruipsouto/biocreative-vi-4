Neurosci. 16, 955-963], but absolute levels of their regional expression and subunit composition have not yet been fully established. To investigate these issues, an IbTX analogue ([125I]IbTX-D19Y/Y36F) was employed that selectively binds to neuronal BK channels with high affinity (Kd = 21 pM). Cross-linking experiments with [125I]IbTX-D19Y/Y36F in the presence of a bifunctional reagent led to covalent incorporation of radioactivity into a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. Deglycosylation and immunoprecipitation studies with antibodies raised against alpha- and smooth muscle beta-subunits of the BK channel suggest that the beta-subunit that is associated with the neuronal BK channel is a novel protein. Quantitative receptor autoradiography reveals the highest levels of BK channel expression in the outer layers of the neocortex, hippocampal perforant path projections, and the interpeduncular nucleus. This distribution pattern has also been confirmed in immunocytochemical experiments with a BK channel-selective antibody. Taken together, these findings imply that neuronal BK channels exhibit a restricted distribution in brain and have a subunit composition different from those of their smooth muscle congeners.",

          "text": "To identify residues and domains of the peptide hormone pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) that interact with the type I receptor, two photoreactive analogues of PACAP-(1-27)-peptide were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis. Phe6 or Tyr22 within the PACAP sequence were replaced by p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bz-Phe) thus creating two PACAP derivatives with a photoreactive amino acid in either the disordered N-terminal or the helical C-terminal part of the peptide. The ligand-binding properties and the efficiencies of these peptide analogues as photolabels were tested for pig brain PACAP receptors. [Bz-Phe6]-PACAP-(1-27)-peptide (Kd 1.3 nM) retained the high binding affinity of PACAP-(1-27)-peptide (Kd 0.5 nM), wheras Bz-Phe substitution of Tyr22 reduced the affinity about tenfold (Kd 4.4 nM) thus demonstrating the importance of Tyr22 for receptor binding. Monoiodination of the photoreactive analogues did not change the binding affinity of the photoreactive analogues. Photoaffinity labeling using pig brain membrane demonstrated that the 125I-labeled photoreactive analogues specifically label a 66000-Mr protein band. Photoaffinity labeling of the rat brain PACAP receptor expressed in COS cells resulted in two specifically photolabeled proteins: a major band of Mr 58000 and a minor band of Mr 78000. By treatment of photolabeled membranes with N-glycosidase F, both of the polypeptide bands were converted to a single polypeptide band of Mr 54000, which corresponds to the deglycosylated PACAP receptor. Despite its lower receptor affinity, [Bz-Phe22]-PACAP-(1-27)-peptide labeled the PACAP type I receptor in pig brain membranes and the rat receptor expressed in COS cells with much higher efficiency (20-fold for the pig receptor) than [Bz-Phe6]-PACAP-(1-27)-peptide. These findings suggest that Tyr22 in PACAP-(1-27)-peptide is located in or close to the hormone-binding site of the PACAP type I receptor. The results provide evidence that the alpha-helical C-terminal region of PACAP is directly involved in receptor binding.",

The subset of DMP1 binding sites containing the GGA core can bind Ets family transcription factors Ets-1 and Ets-2. Screening of a series of natural promoters revealed that the CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN; EC 3.4.11.2) promoter could bind and be activated by DMP1. Activation of CD13/APN required both the intact DNA binding and transactivation domains of DMP1 and was inhibited by D-type cyclins, but not by cyclins A, B, C, or H, in a CDK-independent manner. CD13/APN is transactivated by a cooperative interaction between c-Myb bound to its cognate site and Ets-1 tethered to one of three GGA core-containing sites located 30-50 base pairs downstream. DMP1 binds to one of the Ets binding sites (designated Ets C) and synergizes with c-Myb in activating CD13/APN expression. Analysis of nuclear lysates from KG1a early myeloid cells using an oligonucleotide probe containing only the DMP1/Ets C binding site indicated that endogenous DMP1 and a putative Ets family member bind this element in vivo. DMP1-DNA complexes were significantly more stable than those containing the Ets factor. These data indicate that two different Myb family proteins collaborate in regulating APN gene expression and point to a role for DMP1 in normal myeloid cell development.",

Budding yeast Cdc6p binds to chromatin near autonomously replicating sequence elements in late M to early G1 phase through an interaction with Origin Recognition Complex or another origin-associated factor. It then facilitates the subsequent loading of the Mcm family of proteins near autonomously replicating sequence elements by an unknown mechanism. All Cdc6p homologues contain a bipartite Walker ATP-binding motif that suggests that ATP binding or hydrolysis may regulate Cdc6p activity. To determine whether these motifs are important for Cdc6p activity, mutations were made in conserved residues of the Walker A and B motifs. Substitution of lysine 114 to alanine (K114A) in the Walker A motif results in a temperature-sensitive phenotype in yeast and slower progression into S phase at the permissive temperature. A K114E mutation is lethal. The Cdc6(K114E) protein binds to chromatin but fails to promote loading of the Mcm proteins, suggesting that ATP binding is essential for this activity. The mutant arrests with a G1 DNA content but retains the ability to restrain mitosis in the absence of DNA replication, unlike depletion of Cdc6p. In contrast, Cdc6p containing a double alanine mutation in the Walker B motif, DE(223, 224)AA, is functional, and the mutant exhibits an apparently normal S phase. These results suggest that Cdc6p nucleotide binding is important for establishing the prereplicative complex at origins of DNA replication and that the amino terminus of Cdc6p is required for blocking entry into mitosis.",

However, its role in mammalian cells is unknown. To identify potential effectors of Cdc42Hs, we incubated lysates from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or PC12 cells with immobilized glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc42Hs fusion proteins bound to different guanine nucleotides and observed a specific association between the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate)-bound GST-Cdc42Hs. Recombinant p85 formed a complex with GTP gamma S-bound GST-Cdc42Hs and with a GTPase-defective GTP-bound GST-Cdc42Hs-Q61L mutant, but not with a GTP gamma S-bound, effector domain GST-Cdc42HsT35A mutant. Both the Rho-GAP homology domain of p85 and the Cdc42Hs-GAP competitively inhibited the binding of recombinant p85 to Cdc42Hs. In addition, PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-p85 antibody was stimulated 2-4-fold by GST-Cdc42-GTP gamma S. Similar interactions were observed between p85 and GST-Rac1-GTP gamma S but not between p85 and GST-RhoA-GTP gamma S. These findings suggest that PI 3-kinase, through the Rho-GAP homology domain of p85, can couple to the effector domain of Cdc42Hs and that p85 may be a target for the GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs and Rac1.",

As we demonstrated previously for alphaIIbbeta3 on agonist-stimulated platelets and for purified alphaIIbbeta3 molecules incubated with Mn(2+), two regimes of rupture forces were present when wild-type alphaIIbbeta3 was activated by the monoclonal antibody PT25-2: rupture forces of 20-60 pN with an exponentially decreasing probability of detection and rupture forces in the range of 60-150 pN with a maximum at approximately 70-80 pN. Both rupture force regimes were specific for fibrinogen binding to the activated conformation of alphaIIbbeta3 because they were inhibited by alphaIIbbeta3-specific antagonists. Identical rupture force regimes were present constitutively when cells expressing the alphaIIb and beta3 transmembrane domain mutants were studied, confirming that these mutations induced an active alphaIIbbeta3 conformation. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the yield strength of the low-to-moderate and strong force regimes when alphaIIbbeta3 was activated by PT25-2 or the transmembrane domain mutations, implying that there was no fundamental difference in the way these forms of activated alphaIIbbeta3 interacted with fibrinogen. Thus, the two-step pathway of the interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with fibrinogen we have identified appears to be a fundamental property of the high-affinity state of alphaIIbbeta3 and is identical regardless of whether this affinity state is achieved by intracellular, extracellular, or membrane-associated events.",

Pathogen effector-induced alterations activate the receptor.

We find that RIN4 also interacts with the prolyl-peptidyl isomerase (PPIase) ROC1, which is reduced upon RIN4 Thr166 phosphorylation. ROC1 suppresses RPM1 immunity in a PPIase-dependent manner. Consistent with this, RIN4 Pro149 undergoes cis/trans isomerization in the presence of ROC1. While the RIN4(P149V) mutation abolishes RPM1 resistance, the deletion of Pro149 leads to RPM1 activation in the absence of RIN4 phosphorylation. These results support a model in which RPM1 directly senses conformational changes in RIN4 surrounding Pro149 that is controlled by ROC1. RIN4 Thr166 phosphorylation indirectly regulates RPM1 resistance by modulating the ROC1-mediated RIN4 isomerization.",

Inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway affected TGFbeta-mediated phosphorylation of ATF2, but did not inhibit phosphorylation of Smad2. SB202190 impaired TGFbeta-mediated changes in cell shape and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Forced expression of dominant-negative (DN) MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3) inhibited TGFbeta-mediated activation of p38MAPK and EMT. Expression of DN-p38alpha impaired TGFbeta-induced EMT. Inhibition of p38MAPK blocked TGFbeta-induced migration of non-tumor and tumor mammary epithelial cells. TGFbeta induced activation of the p38MAPK pathway within 15 minutes. Expression of TGFbeta type II (TbetaRII) and type I (TbetaRI/Alk5) kinase-inactive receptors blocked EMT and activation of p38MAPK, whereas expression of constitutively active Alk5-T204D resulted in EMT and phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38MAPK. Finally, dominant-negative Rac1N17 blocked TGFbeta-induced activation of the p38MAPK pathway and EMT, suggesting that Rac1 mediates activation of the p38MAPK pathway.

To study the molecular mechanisms underlying SCRA, a missense mutation corresponding to Y421H in human TEAD1 was introduced into mouse Tead1 (Y410H), and a functional analysis of the mutant protein was performed in RPE-J cells. The missense mutation reduced the ability of Tead1 to interact with the co-factors YAP and TAZ, but not with the co-factors Vgl-1, -2, and -3, in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. A GST pull-down assay showed that the direct interaction between Tead1 and YAP or TAZ was lost owing to the mutation. Amino acid substitutions at position 410 of Tead1 revealed the essentiality of this tyrosine residue to the interaction. The Y410H mutation also abolished the transcriptional activity of Tead1 under the co-expression of YAP or TAZ.

METHODS: Western blotting was performed to investigate whether HNF4 is expressed in macrophages of Ba1b/c mice where mfgl2 is expressed. Confocus microscope immunofluorescence was performed to show whether N protein of MHV enters into the nucleus of infected cells, which is a critical step for the N protein to facilitate its transactivation property. To facilitate the identification of three candidate factor(s) including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4)/liver factor A1 (LF-A1), cytomegalovirus immediate early gene 1.2 (IE1.2) regulatory element and granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in response to mfgl2 activation upon the stimulation of MHV-A59 N protein, gel mobility shift assay (GMSA), competition experiments and site directed mutagenesis were performed. RESULTS: Western blotting displayed that HNF4 was constitutively expressed in macrophages and did not show significant change under the stimulation of different MHV. Confocus microscope immunofluorescence clearly showed that N protein of MHV entered into the nucleus of infected cells. GMSA and competition experiments demonstrated binding to both HNF4 and IE1.2 fragments could be competed with the cold specific oligonucleotides but not with the same amount of non-specific oligos nucleotides. A super shift band was observed when HNF4 antibody was pre-incubated with the nuclear extracts indicating the interaction between the HNF4 element and mfgl2 promoter. Site directed mutagenesis of cis-elements HNF4 (pfgl2HNF4mut) and HNF4/IE1.2 (pfgl2HNF4/IE1.2mut) mutations abolished over 75% of transcription from wild-type mfgl2 promoter. However the pfgl2IE1.2mut displayed almost wild-type promoter activity (75% approximately 80%). CONCLUSIONS: The factor HNF4 binds to mfgl2 promoter and serves as an essential transcription factor for mfgl2/fibroleukin expression in response to MHV-3 N protein.",

Phosphopeptide map of MRLC phosphorylated by RSK-2 was identical to that by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Phosphoserine was recovered by the phosphoamino acid analysis of MRLC phosphorylated by RSK-2. Further, phosphorylation using recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of HeLa MRLC2 revealed that RSK-2 phosphorylated wild-type MRLC2 (GST-wtMRLC2) but not its mutants GST-MRLC2(S19A) or GST-MRLC2(T18AS19A) (alanine substituted for Ser19 or both Ser19 and Thr18). These results revealed that RSK-2 phosphorylates MRLC at Ser19 as did MLCK. Phosphorylation of myosin II by RSK-2 resulted in activation of actin-activated MgATPase activity of myosin II. Interestingly, RSK-2 activity to phosphorylate MRLC was suppressed by phosphorylation with MAPK. RSK-2 might be a mediator that regulates myosin II activity through the MAPK cascade.",

In a yeast two-hybrid screen with Vps4p as bait we isolated VPS20 (YMR077c) and the novel open reading frame YLR181c, for which the name VTA1 has recently been assigned (Saccharomyces Genome Database). Vps4p directly binds Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro and binding is not dependent on ATP - conversely, Vps4p binding to Vps20p is partially sensitive to ATP hydrolysis. Both ATP binding [Vps4p-(K179A)] and ATP hydrolysis [Vps4p-(E233Q)] mutant proteins exhibit enhanced binding to Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro. The Vps4p-Vps20p interaction involves the coiled-coil domain of each protein, whereas the Vps4p-Vta1p interaction involves the (non-coiled-coil) C-terminus of each protein. Deletion of either VPS20 (vps20Delta) or VTA1 (vta1Delta) leads to similar class E Vps- phenotypes resembling those of vps4Delta, including carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) secretion, a block in ubiquitin-dependent MVB sorting, and a delay in both post-internalisation endocytic transport and biosynthetic transport to the vacuole. The vacuole resident membrane protein Sna3p (whose MVB sorting is ubiquitin-independent) does not appear to exit the class E compartment or reach the vacuole in cells lacking Vps20p, Vta1p or Vps4p, in contrast to other proteins whose delivery to the vacuole is only delayed. We propose that Vps20p and Vta1p regulate Vps4p function in vivo.",

However, waved-2 mice carrying a mutation in the alpha-helix C of their EGF-R, which abolishes tyrosine kinase activity, only display a mild phenotype and are fully viable. This suggests that the mutant EGF-R signals through heterodimerization with endogenous, kinase active members of the EGF-R family such as ErbB-2 or ErbB-4. We have examined the biochemistry of EGF-Rs carrying mutations in the alpha-helix C of the human EGF-R (V741G and Y740F), in the ATP binding site (K721R) and at the C-terminus (CT957), by expression in BaF/3 cells which are devoid of EGF-R family members. The in vitro kinase activity of the alpha-helix C EGF-R mutants was severely impaired as a result of reduced phosphotransfer activity without appreciable changes in the affinity for either ATP or peptide substrate. Surprisingly, EGF stimulation of cells carrying the different mutant or wild type EGF-Rs resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R proteins; this phosphorylation was abolished in crude plasma membrane preparations, and appears to be due to activation of a membrane-associated or a cytosolic kinase. Receptor-mediated internalization of EGF was profoundly suppressed in the V741G, K721R and CT957 receptor mutant, and high affinity EGF binding was undetectable in the V741G and K721R receptors. We conclude that specific residues in the C-helix of the EGF-R kinase are essential for full kinase activity; mutations in this region do not affect ATP binding, but impair the receptors' phosphotransfer ability. High affinity binding of EGF is not dependent on tyrosine kinase activity or sequences in the C-terminus.",

          "text": "Accumulating evidence indicates that interactions between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src may contribute to an aggressive phenotype in multiple human tumors. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that murine fibroblasts which overexpress both these tyrosine kinases display synergistic increases in DNA synthesis, soft agar growth, and tumor formation in nude mice, and increased phosphorylation of the receptor substrates Shc and phospholipase gamma as compared with single overexpressors. These parameters correlated with the ability of c-Src and EGFR to form an EGF-dependent heterocomplex in vivo. Here we provide evidence that association between c-Src and EGFR can occur directly, as shown by receptor overlay experiments, and that it results in the appearance of two novel tyrosine phosphorylations on the receptor that are seen both in vitro and in vivo following EGF stimulation. Edman degradation analyses and co-migration of synthetic peptides with EGFR-derived tryptic phosphopeptides identify these sites as Tyr845 and Tyr1101. Tyr1101 lies within the carboxyl-terminal region of the EGFR among sites of receptor autophosphorylation, while Tyr845 resides in the catalytic domain, in a position analogous to Tyr416 of c-Src. Phosphorylation of Tyr416 and homologous residues in other tyrosine kinase receptors has been shown to be required for or to increase catalytic activity, suggesting that c-Src can influence EGFR activity by mediating phosphorylation of Tyr845. Indeed, EGF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr845 was increased in MDA468 human breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress c-Src as compared with parental MDA 468 cells. Furthermore, transient expression of a Y845F variant EGFR in murine fibroblasts resulted in an ablation of EGF-induced DNA synthesis to nonstimulated levels. Together, these data support the hypothesis that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr845 is involved in regulation of receptor function, as well as in tumor progression.",

Yellow monoclinic crystals of the D60S mutant, in its iron-bound form, were prepared, and have unit cell dimensions a = 110.2 A, b = 57.0 A, c = 55.2 A, beta = 97.6 degrees, space group C2, with one molecule of 333 residues in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement, using the wild-type Lf(N) as search model, and was refined by restrained least-squares methods. The final model, comprising 2451 protein atoms (from residues 2 to 315) one Fe3+ and one CO2-(3), and 107 water molecules, gives an R-factor of 0.175 for all data in the resolution range 20.0 to 2.05 A. The model conforms well with standard geometry, having root-mean-square deviations of 0.014 A and 1.2 degrees from standard bond lengths and angles. The structure of the D60S mutant deviates in two important respects from the parent Lf(N) molecule. At the mutation site the Ser side-chain neither binds to the iron atom nor makes any interdomain contact as the substituted Asp does; instead a water molecule fills the iron coordination site and participates in interdomain hydrogen bonding. The domain closure is also changed, with the D60S mutant having a more closed conformation. Consideration of crystal packing suggests that the altered domain closure is a genuine molecular property but both the iron coordination and interdomain contacts are consistent with weakened iron binding in the mutant. The implications for iron binding in transferrins generally are discussed.",

We showed that a single mutation, leucine 190 (betaB5) to tryptophan, is required to switch from Group I to Group II. Although this single substitution in YAP WW1 domain is sufficient to precipitate the two protein isoforms of Mena, an in vivo ligand of FE65, we showed that an additional substitution, histidine 192 (betaB7) to glycine, significantly increased the ability of YAP to mimic FE65. This double mutant (L190W/H192G) precipitates eight of the nine protein bands that FE65 pulls down from rat brain protein lysates. Based on both our data and a sequence comparison between Group I and Group II WW domains, we propose that a block of three consecutive aromatic amino acids within the second beta-sheet of the domain is required, but not always sufficient, for a WW domain to belong to Group II. These data deepen our understanding of WW domain binding specificity and provide a basis for the rational design of modified WW domains with potential therapeutic applications.",

This mutant, T167 E, promotes entry into mitosis, as judged by the accumulation of mitotic spindles and condensed chromosomes, despite the fact that it lacks demonstrable kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. However, T167 E cannot promote the metaphase-anaphase transition. Since a component of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in S. pombe, cut9p, remains hypophosphorylated at the T167 E arrest point, the cell cycle block might be due to the inability of T167 E to activate the APC. T167 E is lethal when overexpressed, and overproduction also causes a mitotic arrest. Multicopy suppressors of the dominant negative phenotype were isolated, and identified as cdc13+ and suc1+.

Computer analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of mdm2 revealed 19 putative CK2 phosphorylation sites.

In addition, alpha-synuclein can bind to 14-3-3, and both alpha-synuclein and 14-3-3 bind to many of the same proteins. Because 14-3-3 binds to and activates tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine (DA) biosynthesis, we explored whether alpha-synuclein also bound to tyrosine hydroxylase and influenced its activity. Immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between alpha-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase in brain homogenates and MN9D dopaminergic cells. Colocalization of alpha-synuclein with tyrosine hydroxylase was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. To explore the consequences of the interaction, we measured the effect of recombinant alpha-synuclein on tyrosine hydroxylase activity in a cell-free system and observed a dose-dependent inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase by alpha-synuclein. To measure the impact of alpha-synuclein on tyrosine hydroxylase in dopaminergic cells, we stably transfected MN9D cells with wild-type or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein. Overexpression of wild-type or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein did not significantly alter tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels in our stably transfected cells. However, overexpressing cell lines had significantly reduced tyrosine hydroxylase activity and a corresponding reduction in dopamine synthesis. The reduction in cellular dopamine levels was not caused by increased dopamine catabolism or dopamine efflux. These data suggest that alpha-synuclein plays a role in the regulation of dopamine biosynthesis, acting to reduce the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase. If so, a loss of soluble alpha-synuclein, by reduced expression or aggregation, could increase dopamine synthesis with an accompanying increase in reactive dopamine metabolites.",

However, when it was subsequently incubated with an antihuman IgG directed against the Fc fragment of p75-Fc, the infectivity of RV was significantly lowered (>90%), whereas incubation with antihuman IgG alone had no effect. We then selected eight independent RV mutants that were not neutralized by p75-Fc and antihuman IgG (srr [soluble receptor resistant] mutants). Each mutant carried a single mutation in the glycoprotein gene leading to one amino acid substitution in the protein. A total of four different substitutions were found. Two of the mutations were located at position 318 (phenylalanine replaced by a serine or a valine residue), and two were located at position 352 (histidine replaced by a tyrosine or an arginine residue). All of the mutations prevented the interaction with p75NTR as either a soluble or a membrane-anchored form.

As compared to the short form, the long form has an additional stretch of 65 amino acids containing three tyrosine residues (Y1333, Y1337 and Y1363). Once expressed in fibroblast cells, only the long form is able to elicit both anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar assay and tumors in nude mice, and thus appears endowed with a potential ligand-dependent transforming capacity. Replacement of tyrosine 1337 by phenylalanine abrogates the transforming capacity of the long form. This residue was identified as a potential autophosphorylation site, and a docking site for a substrate important in the signal transduction specific of the long FLT4 isoform. We demonstrate that the GRB2 and SHC cytoplasmic substrates are involved in FLT4 signal transduction. SHC interaction could be crucial to FLT4-mediated transforming activity associated with the long isoform. Finally, trancripts for the two forms are detected in tissues positive for FLT4 gene expression.",

Pb1 has 1396 amino acids, of which the carboxy-terminal 133 residues form a trimeric intra-molecular chaperone that is auto-proteolyzed after correct folding. The structure of a trimer of residues 970-1263 was determined by single anomalous dispersion phasing using incorporated selenomethionine residues and refined at 2.3 \u00c5 resolution using crystals grown from native, methionine-containing, protein. The protein inhibits phage infection by competition. The phage-distal receptor-binding domain resembles a bullet, with the walls formed by partially intertwined beta-sheets, conferring stability to the structure. The fold of the domain is novel and the topology unique to the pb1 structure. A site-directed mutant (Ser1264 to Ala), in which auto-proteolysis is impeded, was also produced, crystallized and its 2.5 \u00c5 structure solved by molecular replacement. The additional chaperone domain (residues 1263-1396) consists of a central trimeric alpha-helical coiled-coil flanked by a mixed alpha-beta domain. Three long beta-hairpin tentacles, one from each chaperone monomer, extend into long curved grooves of the bullet-shaped domain.

          "text": "Like other small G proteins of the Ras superfamily, Rap1 is activated by distinct guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in response to different signals to elicit cellular responses. Activation of Rap1 by cyclic AMP (cAMP) can occur via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-independent and PKA-dependent mechanisms. PKA-independent activation of Rap1 by cAMP is mediated by direct binding of cAMP to Rap1-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rap1-GEFs) Epac1 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1) and Epac2 (Epac1 and Epac2 are also called cAMP-GEFI and -GEFII). The availability of cAMP analogues that selectively activate Epacs, but not PKA, provides a specific tool to activate Rap1. It has been argued that the inability of these analogues to regulate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) signaling despite activating Rap1 provides evidence that Rap1 is incapable of regulating ERKs. We confirm that the PKA-independent activation of Rap1 by Epac1 activates a perinuclear pool of Rap1 and that this does not result in ERK activation. However, we demonstrate that this inability to regulate ERKs is not a property of Rap1 but is rather a property of Epacs themselves. The addition of a membrane-targeting motif to Epac1 (Epac-CAAX) relocalizes Epac1 from its normal perinuclear locale to the plasma membrane. In this new locale it is capable of activating ERKs in a Rap1- and cAMP-dependent manner. Rap1 activation by Epac-CAAX, but not wild-type Epac, triggers its association with B-Raf. Therefore, we propose that its intracellular localization prevents Epac1 from activating ERKs. C3G (Crk SH3 domain Guanine nucleotide exchanger) is a Rap1 exchanger that is targeted to the plasma membrane upon activation. We show that C3G can be localized to the plasma membrane by cAMP/PKA, as can Rap1 when activated by cAMP/PKA. Using a small interfering RNA approach, we demonstrate that C3G is required for the activation of ERKs and Rap1 by cAMP/PKA. This activation requires the GTP-dependent association of Rap1 with B-Raf. These data demonstrate that B-Raf is a physiological target of Rap1, but its utilization as a Rap1 effector is GEF specific. We propose a model that specific GEFs activate distinct pools of Rap1 that are differentially coupled to downstream effectors.",

Mammals have three Mam proteins, which show remarkable similarities in their functions while having an unusual structural diversity. There have also been recent indications that Mam-1 functionally interacts with other transcription factors including p53 tumor suppressor. We herein describe that Mam-1 deficiency in mice abolishes the development of splenic marginal zone B cells, a subset strictly dependent on Notch2, a CSL protein and Delta1 ligand. Mam-1 deficiency also causes a partially impaired development of early thymocytes, while not affecting the generation of definitive hematopoiesis, processes that are dependent on Notch1. We also demonstrate the transcriptional activation of a target promoter by constitutively active forms of Notch to decrease severalfold in cultured Mam-1-deficient cells. These results indicate that Mam-1 is thus required to some extent for Notch-dependent stages in lymphopoiesis, thus supporting the notion that Mam is an essential component of the canonical Notch pathway in mammals.",

The yeast toxicity of all of these proteins was measured, and we found no correlation with fibrillization rate, suggesting that fibrillization is not necessary for synuclein-induced yeast toxicity. We found that beta-synuclein was of intermediate toxicity to yeast, and gamma-synuclein was non-toxic. Co-expression of Parkinson's disease-related genes DJ-1, parkin, Pink1, UCH-L1, or synphilin, with synuclein, did not affect synuclein toxicity. A second screen, of several thousand library clones in yeast, identified 25 non-toxic alpha-synuclein sequence variants. Most of these contained a mutation to either proline or glutamic acid that caused a defect in membrane binding.

Here we took advantage of the nucleoplasmic shuttling of free arrestins and used a \"nuclear exclusion assay\" to study their interactions with two proteins involved in \"life-and-death\" decisions in the cell, the kinase JNK3 and the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells green fluorescent protein (GFP)-JNK3 and GFP-Mdm2 predominantly localize in the nucleus, whereas visual arrestin, arrestin2(Q394L) mutant equipped with the nuclear exclusion signal, and arrestin3 localize exclusively to the cytoplasm. Coexpression of arrestins moves both GFP-JNK3 and GFP-Mdm2 to the cytoplasm. Arrestin mutants \"frozen\" in the basal conformation are the most efficacious. Thus, arrestins in their basal state interact with JNK3 and Mdm2, suggesting that arrestins are likely \"preloaded\" with their interaction partners when they bind the receptor. Robust interaction of free arrestins with JNK3 and Mdm2 and their ability to regulate subcellular localization of these proteins may play an important role in the survival of photoreceptors and other neurons, as well as in retinal and neuronal degeneration.",

In cells, it is converted into three distinct fluoro-based nucleotide analogs, which interfere with DNA synthesis and repair, leading to genome impairment and, eventually, apoptotic cell death. Current knowledge states that in certain cell types, 5-FU-induced stress is signaling through a p53-dependent induction of tumor necrosis factor-receptor oligomerization required for death-inducing signaling complex formation and caspase-8 activation. Here we establish a role of calcium (Ca(2+)) as a messenger for p53 activation in response to 5-FU. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that treatment of colon carcinoma cells stimulates entry of extracellular Ca(2+) through long lasting-type plasma membrane channels, which further directs posttranslational phosphorylation of at least three p53 serine residues (S15, S33 and S37) by means of calmodulin (CaM) activity. Obstructing this pathway by the Ca(2+)-chelator BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) or by inhibitors of CaM efficiently reduces 5-FU-induced caspase activities and subsequent cell death. Moreover, ectopic expression of p53 S15A in HCT116 p53(-/-) cells confirmed the importance of a Ca(2+)-CaM-p53 axis in 5-FU-induced extrinsic apoptosis. The fact that a widely used therapeutic drug, such as 5-FU, is operating via this pathway could provide new therapeutic intervention points, or specify new combinatorial treatment regimes.",

The present study reports a third, novel \"contact site\" between hPTH1-Rc and Lys(27) of PTH(1-34). Lys(27) is located in the principal binding domain of the hormone (residues 25-34). The photoreactive PTH(1-34) analogue K27 contains a benzophenone (BP) moiety on Lys(27). The analogue binds to stably transfected HEK 293/C-21 cells (which express a high level of recombinant hPTH1-Rc) and stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity with a potency similar to PTH(1-34). In addition, (125)I-K27 cross-links effectively and specifically to the hPTH1-Rc. Enzymatic (Glu-C and Lys-C) and chemical (CNBr and BNPS-skatole) digestions of the photoconjugate between (125)I-K27 and hPTH1-Rc were performed. In addition, photoconjugates involving the bioactive mutants [L261M]- and [R262K]-hPTH1-Rc, transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, were also digested. The data obtained clearly identify L(261) or R(262) of the first extracellular loop of hPTH1-Rc as the contact site for Lys(27) in the hormone. On the basis of (i) the similarity in molecular mass between the CNBr digest of the (125)I-K27-[L261M]hPTH1-Rc conjugate and free (125)I-K27 and (ii) the failure to cross-link (125)I-K27 to a bioactive mutant receptor [L261A]hPTH1-Rc, we conclude that L(261) is the cross-linking site. These results provide the first demonstration of an interaction between the principal binding domain of PTH and the first extracellular loop of hPTH1-Rc. Revealing proximity of Lys(27) (in PTH) to L(261) (in hPTH1-Rc) provides additional insight into the nature of the ligand-receptor bimolecular interface and clearly illustrates that the extracellular loops of the receptor contribute to the specificity of the PTH-PTH1-Rc interaction. Taken together with previous studies, the new findings add important constraints on the possible positioning of the C-terminal helix of PTH (which contains the principal binding domain) relative to the first extracellular loop and the distal C-terminal helix of the large extracellular amino terminal domain of the PTH1-Rc.",

Using glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pull-down assays and transient cotransfections of Neuro-2a cells with expression and reporter vectors, we found that one mutation, c.676C>G (p.L226V), does not alter the properties of SIX3 toward NOR1.

To test this, we used P19/43 (R-->W), which is less pathogenic than wild-type P19 (wtP19), and P19/75-78 (RR-->GG), with pathogenicity properties (i.e., viral spread and symptom induction) comparable to those of a P19-null mutant. We demonstrate that P19/43 still suppresses RNAi-mediated viral RNA degradation in infected Nicotiana benthamiana, while P19/75-78 is unable to prevent this clearance of viral RNA, leading to an irreversible recovery phenotype. Gel filtration and immunoprecipitation assays show that at the onset of the infection, wtP19, P19/43, and P19/75-78 readily accumulate, and they form dimers. The wtP19 is stably associated with duplex approximately 21-nt TBSV siRNAs, while P19/75-78 does not bind these molecules, and the electrostatic interaction of P19/43 with siRNAs is perturbed for approximately 21-nt duplexes but not for longer siRNAs. This is the first clear demonstration of a direct correlation between a novel structurally orchestrated siRNA binding of an RNAi suppressor and its roles in viral pathogenesis. The findings should be particularly valuable for the RNAi field in general because the P19 mutants enable precise determination of siRNA appropriation effects.",

There are four isoforms of PP1 namely, PP1\u03b1, PP1\u03b2/\u03b4, PP1\u03b31 and PP1\u03b32. PP1\u03b3 and PP1\u03b2 translocate to the nucleus by binding to a co-transporter that contains a nuclear localization signal. The mechanism by which PP1\u03b1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytosol is not known. In this study, we found that PP1\u03b1 co-immunoprecipitates with 14-3-3\u03b6 from HEK-293 cell lysates. By co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay, we determined that 14-3-3\u03b6 binds to both PP1\u03b1 (WT) and PP1\u03b1 (T320A), and that phosphorylation of PP1\u03b1 is not required for binding. Using PP1\u03b1 deletion mutants, we located the 14-3-3\u03b6 binding region within PP1\u03b1 residues 159-279. An in vitro assay showed that 14-3-3\u03b6 does not affect PP1\u03b1 activity. When HEK-293 cells expressing PP1\u03b1 and 14-3-3\u03b6 were subjected to subcellular fractionation, the ratio of cytosolic vs. nuclear PP1\u03b1 was significantly higher in cells expressing PP1\u03b1 and 14-3-3\u03b6 than those expressing PP1\u03b1 alone. In cells expressing a dominant negative 14-3-3\u03b6 (K49E), PP1\u03b1 accumulated in the nucleus. Our results show that 14-3-3\u03b6 binds to PP1\u03b1 and causes its retention in the cytosol which suggests that 14-3-3\u03b6 regulates nuclear trafficking of PP1\u03b1 in mammalian cells.",

In MCF-7 cells, PAI-1 did not directly activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2, but instead altered the response to uPA so that ERK phosphorylation was sustained. This effect required the cooperative function of uPAR and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr). When MCF-7 cells were treated with uPA-PAI-1 complex in the presence of the VLDLr antagonist, receptor-associated protein, or with uPA-PAI-1(R76E) complex, which binds to the VLDLr with greatly decreased affinity, transient ERK phosphorylation (<5 min) was observed, mimicking the uPA response. ERK phosphorylation was not induced by tissue-type plasminogen activator-PAI-1 complex or by uPA-PAI-1 complex in the presence of antibodies that block uPA binding to uPAR. uPA-PAI-1 complex induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and Shc and sustained association of Sos with Shc, whereas uPA caused transient association of Sos with Shc. By sustaining ERK phosphorylation, PAI-1 converted uPA into an MCF-7 cell mitogen. This activity was blocked by receptor-associated protein and not observed with uPA-PAI-1(R76E) complex, demonstrating the importance of the VLDLr. uPA promoted the growth of other cells in which ERK phosphorylation was sustained, including beta3 integrin overexpressing MCF-7 cells and HT 1080 cells. The MEK inhibitor, PD098059, blocked the growth-promoting activity of uPA and uPA-PAI-1 complex in these cells. Our results demonstrate that PAI-1 may regulate uPA-initiated cell signaling by a mechanism that requires VLDLr recruitment. The kinetics of ERK phosphorylation in response to uPAR ligation determine the function of uPA and uPA-PAI-1 complex as growth promoters.",

In addition, PKD(S738A/S742A) overexpression inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC migration. Furthermore, knockdown of PKD by its specific small interfering RNA inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation and migration. Moreover transfection of PKD(Y463F), PKD(S738A/S742A), or PKD-small interfering RNA blocked VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. Our signaling experiments show that KDR not Flt-1 mediated PKD tyrosine phosphorylation and KDR tyrosine residues 951 and 1059 were required for VEGF-A(165)-stimulated PKD serine and tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively. Whereas G protein Gbetagamma subunits were required for both PKD serine phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization was required for VEGF-A(165)-stimulated PKD tyrosine phosphorylation and phospholipase C (PLC) activity was required for PKD serine phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the PLC inhibitor did not inhibit PKD tyrosine phosphorylation. Instead, PKD tyrosine 463 was required for VEGF-A(165)-stimulated PLCgamma tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, PKD interacted with PLCgamma even in unstimulated cells, and PKD tyrosine 463 phosphorylation was not required for this interaction. Together, we demonstrate that PKD interacts with PLCgamma and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon VEGF stimulation, leading to PLCgamma activation and angiogenic response of VEGF-A(165).",

However, its inhibitory mechanism and subcellular localization remain controversial. Here, we report a novel Survivin mutant Surv-D53A, which displays a function opposite to Survivin and a distinctive subcellular distribution compared with its wild-type counterpart. Surv-D53A was shown to induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner, indicating that tumor suppressor p53 is not involved in its apoptosis pathway. Surv-D53A was shown to markedly sensitize apoptosis induced by TRAIL, doxorubicin, and RIP3. We also demonstrated that similar to wild-type Survivin, Surv-D53A was localized in cytoplasm in interphase and to midbody at telophase. However, it fails to colocalize in chromosomes with Aurora-B in metaphase as wt-Survivin. Surv-D53A mutant is less stable than wt-Survivin and is degraded more rapidly by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Additionally, we found that Surv-D53A interacts with wt-Survivin to form heterodimer or with itself to form mutant homodimer, which may account for the loss of its antiapoptotic function. Finally, unlike Survivin*Survivin, neither Surv-D53A*Survivin nor Surv-D53A*Surv-D53A is able to bind to Smac/DIABLO, which may explain the underlying mechanism for its abolishment of antiapoptotic activity of Survivin.",

In the present study, we have attempted to identify protein kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP at Ser-35. A purified chimeric protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to a domain of EBNA-LP containing Ser-35 was found to be specifically phosphorylated by purified cdc2 in vitro, while GST fused to a mutated domain of EBNA-LP in which Ser-35 was replaced with alanine was not. In addition, overexpression of cdc2 in mammalian cells caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP, while this increased phosphorylation was eliminated if Ser-35 of EBNA-LP was replaced with alanine. These results indicate that the cellular protein kinase cdc2 mediates the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP at Ser-35. Recently, we reported that cdc2 and conserved protein kinases encoded by herpesviruses phosphorylate the same amino acid residue of target proteins (Kawaguchi et al., J Virol 77, 2359-2368, 2003). Consistent with this, the EBV-encoded conserved protein kinase BGLF4 specifically mediated the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP at Ser-35. These results indicate that the coactivator function of EBNA-LP can be regulated by the activity of these cellular and viral protein kinases.",

We previously designed a p53 protein, p53FG, with amino substitutions S121F and V122G targeting loop L1. These two substitutions enhanced the affinity of p53 for specific DNA yet, counterintuitively, decreased the residency time of p53 on DNA. Here, we confirmed these DNA binding properties of p53FG using a different method. We also determined by crystallography the structure of p53FG in its free state and bound to DNA as a tetramer. In the free state, loop L1 adopted a recessed conformation, whereas upon DNA binding, two subunits switched to the extended loop L1 conformation, resulting in a final structure that was very similar to that of wild-type p53 bound to DNA. Thus, altering the apo structure of p53 changed its DNA binding properties, even though the DNA-bound structure was not altered.",

The I93M mutation in UCH-L1 is also associated with familial PD. We recently reported that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and Hsc70 and Hsp90, both of which can function as components of the CMA pathway. We found that the levels of these interactions were aberrantly increased by the I93M mutation, and that expression of I93M UCH-L1 in cells induced the CMA inhibition-associated increase in the amount of alpha-synuclein, a risk factor for PD. The interactions of UCH-L1 with LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were also abnormally enhanced by carbonyl modification of UCH-L1. We propose that aberrant interactions of UCH-L1 variants with CMA machinery, at least partly, underlie the pathogenesis of I93M UCH-L1-associated PD, and possibly of sporadic PD. Our findings may provide novel insights into the links between familial and sporadic PD.",

We recently identified two putative binding sites in ArtJ that might interact with the Art(MP)(2) complex, thereby initiating the transport cycle (A. Vahedi-Faridi et al., J. Mol. Biol. 375:448-459, 2008). Here we investigated the contribution of charged amino acid residues in the second extracellular loop of ArtM to contact with ArtJ. Our results demonstrate a crucial role for residues K177, R185, and E188, since mutations to oppositely charged amino acids or glutamine led to a complete loss of ArtJ-stimulated ATPase activity of the complex variants in proteoliposomes. The defects could not be suppressed by ArtJ variants carrying mutations in site I (K39E and K152E) or II (E163K and D170K), suggesting a more complex interplay than that by a single salt bridge. These findings were supported by cross-linking assays demonstrating physical proximity between ArtJ(N166C) and ArtM(E182C). The importance of positively charged residues for receptor-transporter interaction was underscored by mutational analysis of the closely related transporter HisJ/LAO-HisQMP(2) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. While transporter variants with mutated positively charged residues in HisQ displayed residual ATPase activities, corresponding mutants of HisM could no longer be stimulated by HisJ/LAO. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of the HisQM(K187E)P(2) variant was inhibited by l- and d-histidine in detergent, suggesting a role of the residue in preventing free histidine from gaining access to the substrate binding site within HisQM.",

Two KMTR2-Fabs assembled with the complementarity-determining region 2 of the light chain via two-fold crystallographic symmetry, suggesting that the KMTR2-Fab assembly tended to enhance TRAIL-R2 oligomerization. A single mutation at Asn53 to Arg located at the two-fold interface in the KMTR2 resulted in a loss of its apoptotic activity, although it retained its antigen-binding activity.

Saito, Y., Kakizuka, A., Morii, N., and Narumiya, S. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 1885-1893). p160(ROCK) has a serine/threonine kinase domain in its NH2-terminal region, followed by an approximately 600-amino acid-long alpha-helix, a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif, and a pleckstrin homology region in the COOH terminus. To identify the Rho binding domain of this protein, we divided p160 into five fragments, expressed each as a His-tagged recombinant protein, and performed a ligand overlay assay using [35S]guanosine-5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS)-bound glutathione S-transferase-RhoA. Specific GTPgammaS-Rho binding was observed only in the fragment M2, which covered most of the carboxyl half of the alpha-helix between amino acids 727 and 1021. This fragment was further subdivided into several fragments, and the ligand overlay assay as well as the yeast two hybrid system was carried out to identify the Rho-binding region. These studies localized the minimum Rho binding region to amino acids 934-1015. To identify critical amino acids for Rho binding, we analyzed the Rho binding activity of the subfragment with various point mutations. This analysis revealed that K934M, L941A, and E1008A mutations significantly weakened Rho binding and an I1009A mutation abolished Rho binding.

However, the downstream target genes regulated by RelA-NF-kappaB in the initiation of proapoptotic signaling were not identified. We previously showed that RelA-NF-kappaB functioned as a proapoptotic factor by activating the p53-signaling pathway in response to doxycycline-induced superoxide. In the present study, we demonstrate that the ability of doxycycline/superoxide to induce expression of polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) depends on NF-kappaB activity. We identified a kappaB binding site in the promoter of Plk3, and this kappaB site is directly involved in its induction by the RelA-NF-kappaB complex. Plk3 formed a complex with p53 and was involved in the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 in response to superoxide. Inhibition of Plk3 expression by Plk3 small interfering RNA suppressed the doxycycline/superoxide-mediated apoptosis. Overexpression of wild-type Plk3 in HCT116 p53+/+ cells induced rapid apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild-type Plk3 in HCT116 p53-/- cells and the kinase-defective mutant Plk3(K91R) in p53+/+ cells induced delayed onset of apoptosis. Furthermore, mutagenesis of Plk3 showed that the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-26) is essential for the induction of delay onset of apoptosis. These data show that Plk3 is a RelA-NF-kappaB-regulated gene that induces apoptosis in both p53-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, suggesting a possible mechanism for RelA-NF-kappaB-regulated proapoptotic responses.",

These agents are known to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Pretreatment of cells with these agents attenuated significantly agonist I-BOP induced Ca(2+) release. These agents also induced dose-dependent phosphorylation of the TPalpha as demonstrated by increased (32)P-labeling of the receptor from cells prelabeled with (32)Pi. To facilitate the identification of the intracellular domains involved in phosphorylation, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-intracellular domain fusion proteins were used as substrates for the purified PKG. It was found that only the GST-C-terminal tail fusion protein could serve as a substrate for the PKG. To identify the specific serine/threonine residues in the C-terminal tail being phosphorylated, various alanine mutants of these serine/threonine residues were checked for their ability to serve as substrates. It was found that the Ser-331 of the C-terminal tail was primarily involved in the PKG-mediated phosphorylation. That Ser-331 is a predominant site of phosphorylation was supported by in vivo studies in which HEK293 cells expressing the S331A mutant receptor showed little phosphorylation induced by any of the above three agents. Furthermore, HEK293 cells expressing the S331A mutant receptor pretreated with any of the above three agents became responsive to the agonist I-BOP-induced Ca(2+) release.

Here we show that the product of adenoviral oncogene E1A inhibits the transcriptional activation by both p73alpha and p73beta. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that E1A does not inhibit the sequence-specific DNA binding by p73. Transcriptional activation by a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and either of the activation domains of p73 was inhibited by wild-type (WT) E1A, but not by the N-terminal deletion mutant E1A(Delta2-36). E1A(Delta2-36), which does not bind to the p300/CBP family of coactivators, failed to inhibit p73-mediated transcription, whereas E1A(DeltaCR2), a deletion mutant that does not bind to the pRb family of proteins, inhibited p73-mediated transcription as efficiently as WT E1A. Consistent with these observations, growth arrest induced by p73 expressed from a recombinant adenovirus was abrogated by WT E1A, which correlated with inhibition of p73-mediated induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) by E1A. However, p73 was able to induce p21(WAF1/CIP1) and to mediate growth arrest in the presence of E1A(Delta2-36).

Here, we investigated details underlying the molecular mechanism by which the D620N mutation in Vps35 modulates retromer function, including examination of retromer's subcellular localization and its capacity to sort cargo. We show that expression of the PD-linked Vps35 D620N mutant redistributes retromer-positive endosomes to a perinuclear subcellular localization and that these endosomes are enlarged in both model cell lines and fibroblasts isolated from a PD patient. Vps35 D620N is correctly folded and binds Vps29 and Vps26A with the same affinity as wild-type Vps35. While PD-linked point mutant Vps35 D620N interacts with the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), a known retromer cargo, we find that its expression disrupts the trafficking of cathepsin D, a CI-M6PR ligand and protease responsible for degradation of \u03b1-synuclein, a causative agent of PD. In summary, we find that the expression of Vps35 D620N leads to endosomal alterations and trafficking defects that may partly explain its action in PD.",

Arginine residues 82 and 92, strictly conserved in 35 HPPK sequences, play dynamic roles in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. At 0.89-A resolution, two distinct conformations are observed for each of the two residues in the crystal structure of the wild-type HPPK in complex with two HP variants, two Mg(2+) ions, and an ATP analogue. Structural information suggests that R92 first binds to the alpha-phosphate group of ATP and then shifts to interact with the beta-phosphate as R82, which initially does not bind to ATP, moves in and binds to alpha-phosphate when the pyrophosphoryl transfer is about to occur.

FANCC is also required for optimal activation of STAT1 in response to cytokine and growth factors and for suppressing cytokine-induced apoptosis by modulating the activity of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. Because not all FANCC mutations affect STAT1 activation, the hypothesis was considered that cross-linker resistance function of FANCC depends on structural elements that differ from those required for the cytokine signaling functions of FANCC. Structure-function studies were designed to test this notion. Six separate alanine-substituted mutations were generated in 3 highly conserved motifs of FANCC. All mutants complemented mitomycin C (MMC) hypersensitive phenotype of FA-C cells and corrected aberrant posttranslational activation of FANCD2 in FA-C mutant cells. However, 2 of the mutants, S249A and E251A, failed to correct defective STAT1 activation. FA-C lymphoblasts carrying these 2 mutants demonstrated a defect in recruitment of STAT1 to the interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor and GST-fusion proteins bearing S249A and E251A mutations were less efficient binding partners for STAT1 in stimulated lymphoblasts. These same mutations failed to complement the characteristic hypersensitive apoptotic responses of FA-C cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IFN-gamma. Cells bearing a naturally occurring FANCC mutation (322delG) that preserves this conserved region showed normal STAT1 activation but remained hypersensitive to MMC. The conclusion is that a central highly conserved domain of FANCC is required for functional interaction with STAT1 and that structural elements required for STAT1-related functions differ from those required for genotoxic responses to cross-linking agents. Preservation of signaling capacity of cells bearing the del322G mutation may account for the reduced severity and later onset of bone marrow failure associated with this mutation.",

One protein-protein interaction occurs between the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 and the transactivation motif of p53, and the second interaction occurs between the acidic domain of MDM2 and a motif in the DNA-binding domain of p53. A flexible N-terminal pseudo-substrate or \"lid\" adjacent to the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 has a phosphorylation site, and there are distinct models proposed on how the phosphorylated lid could affect MDM2 function. Biochemical studies have predicted that phosphomimetic mutation will stabilize the lid on the surface of MDM2 and will \"open\" the hydrophobic pocket and stabilize the MDM2-p53 complex, while NMR studies proposed that phosphomimetic mutation \"closes\" the lid over the MDM2 pocket and inhibits MDM2-p53 complex formation. To resolve these discrepancies, we utilized a quantitative fluorescence-based dye binding assay to measure the thermal unfolding of wild-type (wt), DeltaLid, and S17D N-terminal domains of MDM2 as a function of increasing ligand concentration. Our data reveal that S17D lid mutation increases, rather than decreases, the thermostability of the N-terminal domain of MDM2 in the absence or in the presence of ligand. DeltaLid mutation, by contrast, increases MDM2 thermoinstability. This is consistent with biochemical data, using full-length MDM2, showing that the S17D mutation stabilizes the MDM2-p53 complex and increases the specific activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2. These data indicate that phosphomimetic lid mutation results in an \"opening,\" rather than a \"closing,\" of the pocket of MDM2 and highlight the ability of small intrinsically disordered or unstructured peptide motifs to regulate the specific activity of a protein.",

In this pathway, Gpa2 G\u03b1 binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase in response to glucose detection by the Git3 G protein-coupled receptor. Using a two-hybrid screen to identify extrinsic regulators of Gpa2, we isolated a clone that expresses codons 471 to 696 of the Sck1 kinase, which appears to display a higher affinity for Gpa2(K270E)-activated G\u03b1 relative to Gpa2(+) G\u03b1. Deletion of sck1(+) or mutational inactivation of the Sck1 kinase produces phenotypes reflecting increased PKA activity in strains expressing Gpa2(+) or Gpa2(K270E), suggesting that Sck1 negatively regulates PKA activation through Gpa2. In contrast to the Gpa2(K270E) GDP-GTP exchange rate mutant, GTPase-defective Gpa2(R176H) weakly binds Sck1 in the two-hybrid screen and a deletion of sck1(+) in a Gpa2(R176H) strain confers phenotypes consistent with a slight reduction in PKA activity. Finally, deleting sck1(+) in a gpa2\u0394 strain results in phenotypes consistent with a second role for Sck1 acting in parallel with PKA. In addition to this parallel role with PKA, our data suggest that Sck1 negatively regulates Gpa2, possibly targeting the nucleotide-free form of the protein that may expose the one and only AKT/PKB consensus site in Gpa2 for Sck1 to bind. This dual role for Sck1 may allow S. pombe to produce distinct biological responses to glucose and nitrogen starvation signals that both activate the Wis1-Spc1/StyI stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway.",

Peptides are delivered to the site of MHC class I assembly by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), and cell lines that lack this transporter are unable to present endogenous antigens to CTLs. Although it has been shown that a fraction of newly synthesized class I molecules are in physical association with TAP, it is not known whether this interaction is functionally relevant, or where on the class I molecule the TAP binding site might be. RESULTS: C1R cells transfected with a mutant HLA-A2.1 heavy chain (HC), where threonine at position 134 in the alpha 2 domain is changed to lysine (T134K), are unable to present endogenous antigens to CTLs. We have studied the biochemistry of this mutant in C1R cells, and found that a large pool of unstable empty class I HC-beta 2m (beta-2 microglobulin) heterodimers exist that are rapidly transported to the cell surface. The T134K mutant seemed to bind peptide antigens and assemble with beta 2m as efficiently as wild-type HLA-A2.1. However, we show here that the inefficiency with which T134K presents intracellular antigen is associated with its inability to interact with the TAP heterodimer. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments establish that the class I-TAP interaction is obligatory for the presentation of peptide epitopes delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by TAP. Wild-type HLA-A2.1 molecules in TAP-deficient cells are retained in the ER, whereas T134K is rapidly released to the cell surface, but is unstable, suggesting a role for the TAP complex as an intracellular checkpoint that only affects the release of class I molecules with stably bound peptide ligands.",

Here, these interactions were analysed in W12 cell line carrying HPV 16 genome and in clinical samples. W12 cells, in which HPV16 becomes integrated during passages, were utilised to detect viral and ErbB family expression at early (W12E) and late passages (W12G). Interestingly, a strong reduction of ErbB-3 expression was observed in W12G. Loss of the E2 and E5 viral genes occurs in W12G and this may affect ErbB-3 receptor expression. E2 and E5 rescue experiments demonstrated that only E2 gene was able to restore ErbB-3 expression. E2 is a transcriptional factor but the expression levels of ErbB3 were unaffected and ErbB-3 promoter did not show any consensus sequence for E2, thus E2 may interact in another way with ErbB3. Indeed, HPV 16 E2 can modulate ErbB-3 by interacting with the ubiquitin ligase neuregulin receptor degradation protein 1 (Nrdp-1) that is involved in the regulation of this receptor, via ubiquitination and degradation. E2 co-immunoprecipitated in a complex with Nrdp-1 leading to hypothesise an involvement of this interaction in ErbB-3 regulation. In addition, 90% of the clinical samples with integrated virus and E2 loss showed no or low ErbB-3 positivity, confirming in vitro results. In conclusion, the new discovered interaction of HPV-16 E2 with Nrdp-1 may affect ErbB-3 expression.",

The membrane binding of Akt1 to rod outer segments (ROS) is insulin receptor (IR)/PI3K-dependent as demonstrated by reduced binding of Akt1 to ROS membranes of photoreceptor-specific IR knockout mice. Membrane binding of Akt1 is mediated through its Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. To determine whether binding of the PH domain of Akt1 to photoreceptor membranes is regulated by light, various green fluorescent protein (GFP)/Akt1-PH domain fusion proteins were expressed in rod photoreceptors of transgenic Xenopus laevis under the control of the Xenopus opsin promoter. The R25C mutant PH domain of Akt1, which does not bind phosphoinositides, failed to associate with plasma membranes in a light-dependent manner. This study suggests that light-dependent generation of phosphoinositides regulates the activation and membrane binding of Akt1 in vivo.

We expressed trimeric envelope glycoprotein from three primary, macrophage tropic HIV-1 isolates in baby hamster kidney cells and analyzed the furin-mediated cleavage, stability, and receptor binding properties of the oligomers. The envelope glycoprotein was secreted in a soluble form deleted of its transmembrane anchor and the intracytoplasmic domain (gp140). A mixture of trimers, dimers, and monomers of gp140 as well as monomeric gp120 was detected on polyacrylamide gels. Analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that trimers and dimers were essentially composed of uncleaved gp140, whereas most of the gp120 was found in the monomeric fraction. To analyze the effect of the cleavage of gp140 to gp120/Delta41 on trimerization, we co-expressed the furin protease along with gp140. Surprisingly, furin expression changed the subcellular localization of the envelope glycoprotein, which became in majority sequestered in the major furin compartment, the trans-Golgi network, as judged by confocal laser microscopy. The envelope glycoprotein secreted from furin-co-expressing cells was almost completely cleaved to gp120 and Deltagp41, but gp120 was found exclusively in the monomeric fraction, with a few residual oligomers being composed of uncleaved gp140. Secreted uncleaved gp140 trimers were purified to homogeneity and analyzed for their capacity to interact with cellular receptors CD4 and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). Receptor binding was analyzed on CD4- and CCR5-expressing cells as well as on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Trimers showed greatly reduced binding to CD4 as compared with monomers. Neither monomers nor trimers bound directly to CCR5. In conclusion, our results show that the cleaved form of the envelope glycoprotein does not form stable trimers, suggesting that gp120/gp41 oligomers on the virion surface might be stabilized by a yet to be identified mechanism and that the virion might attach to CD4 via a monomeric form of gp120.

To further define ligand-receptor interactions, we prepared a fully functional photoreactive analog of PTHrP, [Ile5,Bpa23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1-36)-amide ([Bpa23]PTHrP, where Bpa is p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine). Upon photolysis, radioiodinated [Bpa23]PTHrP covalently and specifically bound to the rP1R. CNBr cleavage of the broad approximately 80-kDa complex yielded a radiolabeled approximately 9-kDa non-glycosylated protein band that could potentially be assigned to rP1R residues 23-63, Tyr23 being the presumed amino-terminus of the receptor. This assignment was confirmed using a mutant rP1R (rP1R-M63I) that yielded, upon photoligand binding and CNBr digestion, a broad protein band of approximately 46 kDa, which was reduced to a sharp band of approximately 20 kDa upon deglycosylation. CNBr digestion of complexes formed with two additional rP1R double mutants (rP1R-M63I/L40M and rP1R-M63I/L41M) yielded non-glycosylated protein bands that were approximately 6 kDa in size, indicating that [Bpa23]PTHrP cross-links to amino acids 23-40 of the rP1R. This segment overlaps a receptor region previously identified by deletion mapping to be important for ligand binding. Alanine scanning of this region revealed two residues, Thr33 and Gln37, as being functionally involved in ligand binding. Thus, the convergence of photoaffinity cross-linking and mutational data demonstrates that the extreme amino-terminus of the rP1R participates in ligand binding.",

Arfs cycle between an inactive, cytoplasmic, GDP-bound form and an active, membrane-associated, GTP-bound form. 3CD promotes binding of Arf to membranes by initiating recruitment to membranes of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), BIG1 and BIG2. GEFs activate Arf by replacing GDP with GTP. In poliovirus-infected cells, there is a dramatic redistribution of cellular Arf pools that coincides with the reorganization of membranes used to form viral RNA replication complexes. Here we demonstrate that Arf translocation in vitro can be induced by purified recombinant 3CD protein; thus, concurrent translation of viral RNA is not required. Coexpression of 3C and 3D proteins was not sufficient to target Arf to membranes. 3CD expressed in HeLa cells was retained after treatment of the cells with digitonin, indicating that it may interact with a membrane-bound host factor. A F441S mutant of 3CD was shown previously to have lost Arf translocation activity and was also defective in attracting the corresponding GEFs to membranes. A series of other mutations were introduced at 3CD residue F441. Mutations that retained Arf translocation activity of 3CD also supported efficient growth of virus, regardless of their effects on 3D polymerase elongation activity. Those that abrogated Arf activation by 3CD generated quasi-infectious RNAs that produced some plaques from which revertants that always restored the Arf activation property of 3CD were rescued.",

However, the majority of mutations in the POL30 gene encoding PCNA that cause MMR defects also cause replication and other repair defects that contribute to the increased mutation rate caused by these mutations. Here, 20 new pol30 mutants were identified and screened for MMR and other defects, resulting in the identification of two mutations, pol30-201 and pol30-204, that appear to cause MMR defects but little if any other defects. The pol30-204 mutation altered an amino acid (C81R) in the monomer-monomer interface region and resulted in a partial general MMR defect and a defect in MSH2-MSH6 binding in vitro. The pol30-201 mutation altered an amino acid (C22Y) located on the surface of the PCNA trimer that slides over the DNA but did not cause a defect in MSH2-MSH6 binding in vitro. The pol30-201 mutation caused an intermediate mutator phenotype. However, the pol30-201 mutation caused almost a complete defect in the repair of AC and GT mispairs and only a small defect in the repair of a \"+T\" insertion, an effect similar to that caused by an msh6Delta mutation, indicating that pol30-201 primarily effects MSH6-dependent MMR. The chromosomal double mutant msh3-FF>AA msh6-FF>AA eliminating the conserved FF residues of the PCNA interacting motif of these proteins caused a small (<10%) defect in MMR but showed synergistic interactions with mutations in POL30, indicating that the FF>AA substitution may not eliminate PCNA interactions in vivo. These results indicate that the interaction between PCNA and MMR proteins is more complex than was previously appreciated.",

GH-induced Janus kinase-2 activation leads to engagement of several signaling pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5) pathways. Previous work suggests that ERK activation in response to GH may be modulated by several proteins acting as docking molecules, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin receptor substrate-1. In this study we investigate potential roles for the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing insulin receptor substrate-like protein, Grb-2-associated binder-1 (Gab1), in GH signaling. We find in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes that GH promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with SHP2, an Src homology 2-containing cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase. The Grb2 adapter protein, in contrast, is specifically coimmunoprecipitated with Gab1, even in the absence of GH exposure. Using a COS-7 cell transient reconstitution system, we observed that GH-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on the Gab1 PH domain, whereas GH-induced coimmunoprecipitation of SHP2 requires tyrosine 627 of Gab1, as previously reported for EGF-induced Gab1-SHP2 association. Deletion of the Gab1 PH domain significantly attenuates GH-induced ERK activation and trans-activation of a c-fos enhancer-driven reporter construct compared with wild-type Gab1 in this system. In contrast, GH-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and STAT5-dependent trans-activation are similar in cells expressing wild-type or PH domain-deleted Gab1. Notably, neither the ERK nor the STAT5 GH-dependent signaling outcome is affected by expression of the Gab1 mutant with tyrosine 627 changed to phenylalanine. Finally, we observed GH-dependent translocation of a wild-type, but not a PH domain-deleted, Gab1-green fluorescent protein chimera from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Our results suggest selective involvement of Gab1 in GH-induced ERK activation and implicate the Gab1 PH domain as critical in this involvement.",

Indeed, LY294002 and wortmannin prevented the effect of PECAM-1/CD31 cross-linking on cell adhesion, at concentrations known to inhibit PI3K without affecting other kinases. Both compounds blocked neutrophil binding to murine fibroblasts transfected with human ICAM-1, to purified ICAM-1 protein, or to fibronectin, suggesting that PECAM-1/CD31-mediated up-regulation of beta2 and beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion is PI3K-sensitive. We also provide evidence for the association of PECAM-1/CD31 to PI3K, because PI3K was detectable in neutrophil lysates after PECAM-1/CD31 cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. PECAM-1/CD31-dependent recruitment of PI3K was suggested by the finding that the serine/threonine kinase p70 S6 kinase (S6K), a signaling protein downstream of PI3K, is activated in neutrophils upon PECAM-1/CD31 cross-linking, based on the appearance of serine phosphorylation in S6K immunoprecipitates. In turn, S6K is not directly involved in the up-regulation of integrin function because rapamycin, which can inhibit S6K independent of PI3K, did not block PECAM-1/CD31-induced adhesion of neutrophils to beta1 and beta2 integrin substrates. In conclusion, PECAM-1/CD31 appears to be one of the molecules functionally coupled to PI3K, suggesting that this enzyme may represent a common pathway of integrin and adhesiveness regulation in leukocytes.",

Alkali-induced demethylation of PP2AC in purified PP2A heterotrimer (ABalphaC), but not in purified PP2A heterodimer (AC), indicated that a larger fraction of PP2AC is carboxymethylated in ABalphaC than in AC. To explore the role of Leu309 in PP2A holoenzyme assembly, epitope-tagged PP2A catalytic subunit (HA-PP2A) and a mutant of HA-PP2A containing an alanine residue in place of Leu309 (HA-PP2A-L309A) were transiently expressed in COS cells. Both recombinant proteins exhibited serine/threonine phosphatase activity when immunoisolated from COS cell extracts. HA-PP2A, but not HA-PP2A-L309A, was carboxymethylated in vitro. A chromatographic analysis of cell extracts indicated that most endogenous PP2AC and HA-PP2A were co-eluted with the A and Balpha regulatory subunits of PP2A, whereas most HA-PP2A-L309A seemed to elute with the A subunit as a smaller complex or, alternatively, as free catalytic (C) subunit. The A subunit co-immunoisolated with both tagged proteins; however, substantially less Balpha subunit co-immunoisolated with HA-PP2A-L309A than with HA-PP2A. These results demonstrate that the reversibly methylated C-terminal leucine residue of PP2AC is important for Balpha regulatory subunit binding.

The specificity of PI 3-kinase activity was controlled using wortmannin and LY294002. CR2 activation did not trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase p85 subunit, but induced direct interaction of tyrosine phosphorylated p95 with the Src homology 2 domain of p85 subunit, as shown using glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins. Despite identical molecular masses, immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 that interacted in vivo and in vitro with p85 was neither CD19, the 95-kDa proto-oncogene vav, nor Gab1 (a 95-kDa adaptor molecule). Furthermore, p95 tyrosine phosphoprotein also expressed in K562A cells (CR2+ CD19- cells) interacted with Src homology 2 domain of PI 3-kinase p85 subunit after CR2 activation. Activated CR2 did not interact directly with p85 subunit or tyrosine-phosphorylated p95. This suggests the presence of an intermediate molecule between activated CR2 and tyrosine-phosphorylated p95, which may be 3BP2. In addition, in contrast to CD19 activation, CR2 activation did not trigger interaction of CD19 or Vav with PI 3-kinase p85 subunit or coprecipitation of PI 3-kinase activity with CD19. Together, these data clearly demonstrated that CR2 activation triggered in vivo PI 3-kinase activation through a pathway distinct from that triggered through CD19 activation.",

Since Cas-L is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes, it is conceivable that Cas-L plays an important role in lymphocyte-specific signals. Here, we show the involvement of Cas-L in the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 signaling pathway. Cas-L is transiently phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L binds to Crk and C3G. Furthermore, a Cas-L mutant that lacks the SH3 domain, the binding site for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is also tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking, but not upon beta1 integrin crosslinking, suggesting that FAK is not involved in CD3-dependent Cas-L phosphorylation.

The gene encoding the gamma-subunit (GNPTAG) appears to be defective in patients with mucolipidosis type III (ML III). We have analyzed the GNPTAG gene in two siblings with ML III showing elevated activities of several lysosomal enzymes in cultured fibroblasts serum and diminished activities in cultured fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cathepsin D (CtsD) from fibroblasts revealed that the sorting/transport of this lysosomal protease was affected. Addition of ammonium chloride inhibiting pH-dependent processes, such as the CtsD-M6P receptor interaction, indicated that 15 to 20% of the newly synthesized CtsD is transported in ML III fibroblasts in an M6P-dependent manner. By direct sequencing a novel homozygous mutation, c.347_349delACA (p.Asn116del), was identified affecting a potential N-linked glycosylation site. Western blot analysis of extracts from control fibroblasts detect a 97 kDa glycosylated dimer whereas ML III cells contain a GNPTAG dimer of reduced molecular mass.

Furthermore, DYNLL1 as well as DYNLL2 localised to cilia in puncta, consistent with IFT particles, and physically interacted with WDR34, a mammalian homologue of the Chlamydomonas cytoplasmic dynein 2 intermediate chain that also localised to the cilium. This study extends the established Atmin-Dynll1 relationship into a developmental and a ciliary context, uncovering a novel series of interactions between DYNLL1, WDR34 and ATMIN. This identifies potential novel components of cytoplasmic dynein 2 and furthermore provides fresh insights into the molecular pathogenesis of human skeletal ciliopathies. ",

This sequence includes threonine 877 that is involved in hydrogen bonding to the D ring of the steroid molecule and leads to promiscuous ligand activation of the AR when mutated to alanine or serine. A second mutation in this region, H874Y, also results in a receptor protein that has broadened ligand-binding specificity, but retains an affinity for DHT (K(d) = 0.77 nm) similar to that of the wild-type receptor. The structure of the mutant LBD, expressed in Escherichia coli, is not dramatically altered compared with the wild-type AR-LBD in the presence of DHT, but shows a modestly increased sensitivity to protease digestion in the absence of hormone. This mutant AR showed wild-type AR-LBD/N-terminal domain interactions, but significantly enhanced binding and transactivation activity with all three members of the p160 family of coactivator proteins.

The exodomain alone binds hormone with high affinity, whereas the endodomain is the site of receptor activation. Coordination of these two domains is essential for successful hormone action but little is known about their functional and structural relationship. In this communication, we report that exoloop 3 of FSH-R constrains follicle-stimulating hormone binding to the exodomain. When the FSH-R exodomain was prepared by truncating its endodomain, the hormone binding affinity of the exodomain was slightly improved, compared with the wild type receptor. The binding affinity was further improved by >3-fold when the exodomain was attached to the membrane-associated domain of CD8. These results suggest that the FSH-R endodomain attenuates hormone binding at the exodomain. As a first step to test this hypothesis, the 11 amino acids except Ala589 of exoloop 3 were individually substituted with Ala. Ala substitution for Leu583 or Ile584 improved the hormone binding affinity by 4-6-fold while totally abolishing cAMP induction, indicating an inverse relationship. The Ala substitution for Lys580 or Pro582 had a similar trend but to a lesser extent. This significant improvement in the binding affinity suggests that the four residues at the N-terminal region of exoloop 3 interact with the exodomain and constrain the hormone binding in the wild type receptor. This effect is specific since substitutions for other than the 4 residues did not improve the hormone binding affinity. Computer modeling shows that the 4 residues can be positioned on one side of exoloop 3. This result and the apparent inverse relationship of hormone binding and cAMP induction suggest that these two essential functions may work against each other. Therefore, hormone binding might be compromised to preserve cAMP inducibility while maintaining a reasonably high, but below maximum, binding affinity.",

We previously isolated and characterized a novel Tax-binding protein, TRX (TAX1BP2), by screening a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. In the present study, we present evidence that the tumour suppressor p53 targets the TRX protein for proteasome degradation. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that p53 enhanced the degradation of TRX protein and reduced the half-life from 2.0 to 0.25 h. p53 mutants R248W and R273H enhance TRX degradation suggesting a transcriptionally independent mechanism. Both HTLV-I Tax and the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 inhibited p53-mediated TRX protein degradation. These results suggest that TRX degradation is mediated through activation of the proteasome protein degradation pathway independent of transcriptional function of p53.

Clones containing SH2 domains of phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2) were frequently isolated and shown to interact with phosphorylated Tyr721 of the Fms receptor, which is also the binding site of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). At variance with previous reports, M-CSF induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma2 in myeloid FDC-P1 cells and this activation required the activity of the PI3-kinase pathway. The Fms Y721F mutation strongly decreased this activation. Moreover, the Fms Y807F mutation decreased both binding and phosphorylation of PLC-gamma2 but not that of p85. Since the Fms Y807F mutation abrogates the differentiation signal when expressed in FDC-P1 cells and since this phenotype could be reproduced by a specific inhibitor of PLC-gamma, we propose that a balance between the activities of PLC-gamma2 and PI3-kinase in response to M-CSF is required for cell differentiation.",

Although the molecular target was not identified, Ran is known to function by modulating protein interactions for karyopherin (Kap) beta family members. Here we characterize loss-of-function Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants in KAP95 with blocks in NPC assembly. Similar to defects in Ran cycle mutants, nuclear pore proteins are no longer localized properly to the NE in kap95 mutants. Also like Ran cycle mutants, the kap95-E126K mutant displayed enhanced lethality with nic96 and nup170 mutants. Thus, Kap95 and Ran are likely functioning at the same stage in assembly. However, although Ran cycle mutants accumulate small cytoplasmic vesicles, cells depleted of Kap95 accumulated long stretches of cytoplasmic membranes and had highly distorted NEs. We conclude that Kap95 serves as a key regulator of NPC assembly into intact NEs. Furthermore, both Kap95 and Ran may provide spatial cues necessary for targeting of vesicular intermediates in de novo NPC assembly.",

However, features that explain their propensity to interact homomerically or heteromerically and determine the strength of these interactions are poorly understood. Integrins provide an ideal model system for addressing these questions because the TM helices of full-length integrins interact heteromerically when integrins are inactive, but isolated TM helices are also able to form homodimers or homooligomers in micelles and bacterial membranes. We sought to determine the features defining specificity for homointeractions versus heterointeractions by conducting a comprehensive comparison of the homomeric and heteromeric interactions of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 TM helices in biological membranes. Using the TOXCAT assay, we found that residues V700, M701, A703, I704, L705, G708, L709, L712, and L713, which are located on the same face of the beta3 helix, mediate homodimer formation. We then characterized the beta3 heterodimer by measuring the ability of beta3 helix mutations to cause ligand binding to alphaIIbbeta3. We found that mutating V696, L697, V700, M701, A703. I704, L705, G708, L712, and L713, but not the small residue-X(3)-small residue motif S699-X(3)-A703, caused constitutive alphaIIbbeta3 activation, as well as persistent focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation dependent on alphaIIbbeta3 activation. Because alphaIIb and beta3 use the same face of their respective TM helices for homomeric and heteromeric interactions, the interacting surface on each has an intrinsic \"stickiness\" predisposing towards helix-helix interactions in membranes. The residues responsible for heterodimer formation comprise a network of interdigitated side chains with considerable geometric complementarity; mutations along this interface invariably destabilize heterodimer formation. By contrast, residues responsible for homomeric interactions are dispersed over a wider surface. While most mutations of these residues are destabilizing, some stabilized homooligomer formation. We conclude that the alphaIIbbeta3 TM heterodimer shows the hallmark of finely tuned heterodimeric interaction, while homomeric interaction is less specific.",

Here we show that MIR16 belongs to a large, evolutionarily conserved family of GDEs with a characteristic putative catalytic domain that shares a common motif (amino acids 92-116) with the catalytic domains of mammalian phosphoinositide phospholipases C. Expression of wild-type MIR16 (renamed GDE1), but not two catalytic domain mutants (E97A/D99A and H112A), leads to a dramatic increase in glycerophosphoinositol phosphodiesterase (GPI-PDE) activity in HEK 293T cells. Analysis of substrate specificity shows that GDE1/MIR16 selectively hydrolyzes GPI over glycerophosphocholine. The GPI-PDE activity of GDE1/MIR16 expressed in HEK 293T cells can be regulated by stimulation of G protein-coupled, alpha/beta-adrenergic, and lysophospholipid receptors. Membrane topology studies suggest a model in which the catalytic GDE domain faces the lumenextracellular space and the C terminus faces the cytoplasm.

To obtain a better understanding of the CHK2 signaling pathway, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for potential CHK2-interacting proteins. Here, we report the identification of the mitotic checkpoint kinase, TTK/hMps1, as a novel CHK2-interacting protein. TTK/hMps1 directly phosphorylates CHK2 on Thr-68 in vitro. Expression of a TTK kinase-dead mutant, TTK(D647A), interferes with the G(2)/M arrest induced by either ionizing radiation or UV light. Interestingly, induction of CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation and of several downstream events, such as cyclin B1 accumulation and Cdc2 Tyr-15 phosphorylation, is also affected. Furthermore, ablation of TTK expression using small interfering RNA results not only in reduced CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation, but also in impaired growth arrest. Our results are consistent with a model in which TTK functions upstream from CHK2 in response to DNA damage and suggest possible cross-talk between the spindle assembly checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint.",

          "text": "We have shown that SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) proteins not only participate directly in exocytosis, but also regulate the dominant membrane-repolarizing Kv channels (voltage-gated K+ channels), such as Kv2.1, in pancreatic beta-cells. In a recent report, we demonstrated that WT (wild-type) Syn-1A (syntaxin-1A) inhibits Kv2.1 channel trafficking and gating through binding to the cytoplasmic C-terminus of Kv2.1. During beta-cell exocytosis, Syn-1A converts from a closed form into an open form which reveals its active H3 domain to bind its SNARE partners SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) and synaptobrevin. In the present study, we compared the effects of the WT Syn-1A and a mutant open form Syn-1A (L165A, E166A) on Kv2.1 channel trafficking and gating. When co-expressed in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney-293 cells), the open form Syn-1A decreased Kv2.1 current density more than (P<0.05) the WT Syn-1A (166+/-35 and 371+/-93 pA/pF respectively; control=911+/-91 pA/pF). Confocal microscopy and biotinylation experiments showed that both the WT and open form Syn-1A inhibited Kv2.1 expression at the plasma membrane to a similar extent, suggesting that the stronger reduction of Kv2.1 current density by the open form compared with the WT Syn-1A is probably due to a stronger direct inhibition of channel activity. Consistently, dialysis of the recombinant open form Syn-1A protein into Kv2.1-expressing HEK-293 cells caused stronger inhibition of Kv2.1 current amplitude (P<0.05) than the WT Syn-1A protein (73+/-2 and 82+/-3% of the control respectively). We found that the H3 but not H(ABC) domain is the putative active domain of Syn-1A, which bound to and inhibited the Kv2.1 channel. When co-expressed in HEK-293 cells, the open-form Syn-1A slowed down Kv2.1 channel activation (tau=12.3+/-0.8 ms) much more than (P<0.05) WT Syn-1A (tau=7.9+/-0.8 ms; control tau=5.5+/-0.6 ms). In addition, only the open form Syn-1A, but not the WT Syn-1A, caused a significant (P<0.05) left-shift in the steady-state inactivation curve (V(1/2)=33.1+/-1.3 and -29.4+/-1.1 mV respectively; control V(1/2)=-24.8+/-2 mV). The present study therefore indicates that the open form of Syn-1A is more potent than the WT Syn-1A in inhibiting the Kv2.1 channel. Such stronger inhibition by the open form of Syn-1A may limit K+ efflux and thus decelerate membrane repolarization during exocytosis, leading to optimization of insulin release.",

In this study, we examine the biochemical effects of N244H and N244K in an effort to understand the mechanism underlying rod- and cone-dominant defects, respectively. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with either wild-type (WT) RDS or RDS containing an N244H or N244K mutation along with its binding partner, ROM-1 (rod outer segment membrane protein 1). Cell extracts were analyzed for mutant protein stability by Western blot, and localization was examined by immunocytochemistry. Interactions between transfected proteins were assessed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, and nonreducing velocity sedimentation was used to identify the pattern of RDS complex assembly. Interactions were confirmed using GST fusion constructs of WT and mutant RDS in GST pull-down assays from WT mouse retinal extract. In COS-1 cells, recombinant N244H RDS had a weakened ability to assemble into higher-order complexes but retained the ability to co-immunoprecipitate with ROM-1 as well as localize properly throughout the cells. In contrast, recombinant N244K protein did not associate with ROM-1, showed signs of protein aggregation, and colocalized with an ER marker. These experiments support the hypothesis that RDS mutations that interrupt higher-order oligomer formation but still interact with ROM-1 and fold properly in membranes may cause dominant, gain-of-function disease phenotypes while mutations that cause RDS misfolding (and thus incorrect trafficking and assembly) may be associated with a loss-of-function haploinsufficiency phenotype.",

We now show that HIP1/PDGFbetaR oligomerizes, is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, and transforms the murine hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, to interleukin-3-independent growth. A kinase-inactive mutant is neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor able to transform Ba/F3 cells. Oligomerization and kinase activation required the 55-amino acid carboxyl-terminal TALIN homology region but not the leucine zipper domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein and STAT5 correlates with transformation in cells expressing HIP1/PDGFbetaR and related mutants. A deletion mutant fusion protein that contains only the TALIN homology region of HIP1 fused to PDGFbetaR is incapable of transforming Ba/F3 cells and does not tyrosine-phosphorylate p130 or STAT5, although it is itself constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated. We have also analyzed cells expressing Tyr --> Phe mutants of HIP1/PDGFbetaR in the known PDGFbetaR SH2 docking sites and report that none of these sites are necessary for STAT5 activation, p130 phosphorylation, or Ba/F3 transformation. The correlation of factor-independent growth of hematopoietic cells with p130 and STAT5 phosphorylation/activation in both the HIP1/PDGFbetaR Tyr --> Phe and deletion mutational variants suggests that both STAT5 and p130 are important for transformation mediated by HIP1/PDGFbetaR.",

The alpha-chain of GP Ib contains binding sites for both vWF and alpha-thrombin within a 45-kDa N-terminal tryptic fragment. In the present study, we have further delineated these sites using smaller proteolytic fragments and functional antibodies. Mocarhagin, a cobra venom metallaproteinase, generates the fragment His-1-Glu-282, while cathepsin G, a neutrophil granule serine protease, generates a slightly smaller fragment, His-1-Leu-275. His-1-Glu-282 was as effective as intact soluble GP Ibalpha (glycocalicin) in inhibiting botrocetin-dependent binding of vWF to washed platelets (IC50 approximately 0.3 microM) whereas His-1-Leu-275 was an order of magnitude less effective (IC50 approximately 3 microM). Residues Tyr-276-Glu-282 (YDYYPEE) are part of an anionic region homologous to thrombin-binding molecules such as hirudin. In ligand blot analysis, thrombin blotted the His-1-Glu-282 fragment, but not His-1-Leu-275. The three tyrosine residues within Tyr-276-Glu-282 meet the consensus criteria for O-sulfation. A method was developed to distinguish O-sulfated from nonsulfated tyrosine residues based on differences in the UV absorbance spectra. Residues Tyr-276-Glu-282 were isolated from glycocalicin by proteolysis with mocarhagin and cathepsin G. Ion spray mass spectrometry confirmed that Tyr-278 and Tyr-279 was only approximately 50% O-sulfated. Four anti-GP Ibalpha monoclonal antibodies (SZ2, ES85, C34 and VM16d) were found to be modulator-specific, strongly inhibiting botrocetin-dependent binding of vWF, but having less or no effect on ristocetin-dependent vWF binding. These antibodies also inhibited the binding of thrombin to fixed platelets. Immunoprecipitation with GP ibalpha fragments defined the epitopes for these antibodies as SZ2 (Tyr-276-Glu-282), ES85 (Asp-283-Arg-293), C34 (His-1-Glu-282), and VM16d (His-1-Leu-275). An antibody which inhibited ristocetin-dependent, as well as botrocetin-dependent, vWF binding but had no effect on thrombin binding (Ak2) had an epitope within His-1-Leu-275. These findings indicate that the sulfated tyrosine/anionic GP Ibalpha residues Tyr-276-Glu-282 are important for the binding of thrombin and botrocetin-dependent binding of thrombin and the botrocetin-dependent binding of vWF, but that vWF also interacts with residues within His-1-Leu-275.",

Extensive biochemical studies have been devoted recently to understand sumoylations and its biological implications, whereas the structural aspects of the PIAS family and the mechanism of its interactions with various factors are less well known to date. In this study, the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-65) of SUMO ligase PIAS1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure revealed a unique four-helix bundle with a topology of an up-down-extended loop-down-up, a part of which the helix-extended loop-helix represented the SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) motif. Thus, this N-terminal domain may be referred to as a four-helix SAP domain. The glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay demonstrated that this domain possesses a binding ability to tumor suppressor p53, a target protein for sumoylation by PIAS1, whereas gel mobility assays showed that it has a strong affinity toward A/T-rich DNA. An NMR analysis of the four-helix SAP domain complexed with the 16-bp-long DNA demonstrated that one end of the four-helix bundle is the binding site and may fit into the minor groove of DNA. The three-dimensional structure and its binding duality are discussed in conjunction with the biological functions of PIAS1 as a SUMO ligase.",

Here, we tested the role of the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B in recruiting CaMKII\u03b1 to synapses with different paradigms: global bath stimulation of NMDA receptors, a chemical long term potentiation (cLTP) protocol that selectively activates synaptic NMDA receptors, or local stimulation of NMDA receptors at a contiguous set of ~10-30 synapses that triggers a propagating synaptic accumulation of CaMKII. Global or cLTP-induced synaptic accumulation of CaMKII\u03b1 occurred in wild-type but not sister GluN2B -/- cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Expression of YFP-GluN2B, but not a similar level of YFP-GluN2A, rescued global and cLTP-induced CaMKII\u03b1 translocation. Using chimeric constructs, the pore-forming extracellular and membrane domains of GluN2A combined with the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2B were sufficient to rescue CaMKII\u03b1 translocation, whereas the reverse chimera was ineffective. Furthermore, the dual point mutation R1300Q,S1303D in GluN2B that blocks interaction of this high affinity site with CaMKII abolished rescue. Thus, CaMKII binding to GluN2B is required for global and cLTP-induced synaptic accumulation of CaMKII\u03b1. However, surprisingly, locally induced propagating synaptic accumulation of CaMKII\u03b1 occurred normally in GluN2B -/- neurons, indistinguishably from wild-type. Thus, synaptic trapping of CaMKII during locally induced propagating translocation occurs by different mechanisms and molecular partners compared with global stimulation and cLTP paradigms. These findings underscore the complex regulatory properties and molecular interactions of CaMKII\u03b1, a key player in synaptic plasticity.",

Chemical and enzymatic digestions of the (125)I-[Bpa(3)]AngII-AT(1) complex were performed, and receptor fragments were analyzed in order to define the region of the receptor with which the ligand interacts. Results show that CNBr hydrolysis of the photolabeled receptor gave a glycosylated fragment which, after PNGase-F digestion, migrated as a 11.4 kDa fragment, circumscribing the labeled domain between residues 143-243 of the AT(1) receptor. Digestion of the receptor-ligand complex with Endo Lys-C or trypsin followed by PNGase-F treatment yielded fragments of 7 and 4 kDa, defining the labeling site of (125)I-[Bpa(3)]AngII within residues 168-199 of the AT(1) receptor. Photolabeling of three mutant receptors in which selected residues adjacent to residue 168 were replaced by methionine within the 168-199 fragment (I172M, T175M, and I177M) followed by CNBr cleavage revealed that the bound photoligand (125)I-[Bpa(3)]AngII forms a covalent bond with the side chain of Met(172) of the second extracellular loop of the AT(1) receptor.

The mutants were expressed in HEK-293 cells and analyzed for their ability to bind the chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and for activating Gt, the G protein of the rod cell regulated by rhodopsin. Removal of 38 carboxyl-terminal amino acids resulted in the production of a mutant (K311 stop) that does not bind 11-cis-retinal, has an abnormal pattern of glycosylation, and does not catalyze light-dependent binding of GTP gamma S to Gt, suggesting that it is unable to fold properly during biogenesis. However, a truncation mutant with only five additional amino acids (C316stop) coupled normally to Gt, using membranes from transfected cells, despite the fact that it lacked the \"fourth cytoplasmic loop\" formed by palmitoylation of cysteines-322 and -323. When C316stop is extracted from the membrane with detergent, only a fraction is able to bind 11-cis-retinal, but the fraction that binds retinal activates Gt normally. In contrast, detergent-solubilized wild-type rhodopsin and K325stop (a truncation mutant with the longest carboxyl terminus) both bind retinal and activate Gt normally. These data suggest that the proximal region of the carboxyl terminus is critical for the proper folding and stability of the rhodopsin molecule and that amino acids Cys316 to Ala348 are not necessary for the activation of Gt.",

Peptide activity is significantly affected by the absence of the isoprenoid moiety. Moreover, we show that altering the amino acid sequence of the farnesylated peptide by randomizing the sequence, substituting hydrophobic with hydrophilic residues (F64T; L67S) or deleting amino acids 60-66 significantly reduces the ability of the peptide to stabilize M II. This indicates that both the farnesyl moiety and the structure of the gamma subunit tail are specific determinants of receptor-G protein interaction. These results also suggest a general function for the family of G protein gamma subunits in signaling.",

Bacteriochlorophyll served as internal probe for the fitness of this new region for the assembly and energy transfer function of the LH2 complex. The ability to absorb and transfer light energy is practically undisturbed by the exchange of the transmembrane segment, valine -7 to threonine +6, of LH2-alpha with a 14 residue Ala-Leu sequence. This stretch makes up the residues of the transmembrane helix that are in close contact (< or =4.5 A) with the bacteriochlorophyll molecules that are coordinated through His of both the alpha and beta-subunits. In this Ala-Leu stretch, neither alpha-His0, which binds the bacteriochlorophyll, nor the adjacent alpha-Ile-1, were replaced. Novel LH2 complexes composed of LH2-alpha with a model transmembrane sequence and a normal LH2-beta are assembled in vivo into a complex, the biochemical and spectroscopic properties of which closely resemble the native one. In contrast, the additional insertion of four residues just outside the C-terminal end of the model transmembrane helix leads to complete loss of functional antenna complex. The results suggest that light energy can be harvested and transferred efficiently by bacteriochlorophyll molecules attached to only few key residues distributed over the polypeptide, while residues at the bacteriochlorophyll-helix interface seem to be largely dispensable for the functional assembly of this membrane protein complex. This novel antenna with a simplified transmembrane domain and a built-in probe for assembly and function provides a powerful model system for investigation of the factors that contribute to the assembly of chromophores in membrane-embedded proteins.",

We have examined the interaction of PITX2 isoforms with myocyte-enhancing factor 2A (MEF2A), which is a known regulator of cardiac development. A direct interaction between PITX2a and MEF2A was demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. To study the functional significance of this interaction, we used the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter. Coexpression of MEF2A and PITX2a or Pitx2c resulted in a strong synergistic activation of the ANF promoter in LS8 oral epithelial cells but not in other cell lines (NIH/3T3, Chinese hamster ovary, or C2C12). The synergism was dependent on promoter context, because it required MEF2 binding sites and was not seen with two other PITX2 target promoters. DNA binding by MEF2A was required but not sufficient for synergism. Upstream activators of p38 MAP kinases, MKK3 and MKK6, increased PITX2a and Pitx2c activity to yield up to 90-fold activation of the ANF promoter in LS8 cells. Because Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is autosomal dominant and affects development of the oral epithelium, we tested one of the known PITX2 mutants. The PITX2a-K88E mutant protein suppressed wild type PITX2a synergism with MEF2A. These results demonstrate a promoter- and cell-specific functional interaction between PITX2 and MEF2A and suggest the possibility of coordinate control by these factors in the oral epithelium.",

To assess the role of Shb in PDGF-mediated signaling, we have overexpressed wild-type Shb or Shb carrying a mutation (R522K) which renders the SH2 domain inactive, in Patch mouse (PhB) fibroblasts expressing both PDGF receptors (PhB/Ralpha). Overexpression of wild-type Shb, but not the R522K Shb mutant, affected PDGF-mediated reorganization of the cytoskeleton by decreasing membrane ruffle formation and stimulating the generation of filopodia relative the parental control cells. In addition, the PDGF-induced receptor-associated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt was similar in both PhB/Ralpha/Shb and PhB/Ralpha/ShbR522K cells compared with the parental control, whereas the activation of Rac in response to PDGF-BB was diminished only in the PhB/Ralpha/Shb cells. We conclude that Shb plays a role in PDGF-dependent regulation of certain cytoskeletal changes by modulating the ability of PDGF to activate Rac.",

The capacities of the Y988F and Y1018F mutant PDGF alpha-receptors, expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells, to bind PLC-gamma are 60 and 5% of that of the wild-type receptor, respectively. Phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated peptides containing Tyr-1018 are able to compete with the intact receptor for binding to immobilized PLC-gamma SH2 domains; a phosphorylated Tyr-988 peptide competes 10 times less efficiently. The complex between PLC-gamma and the PDGF alpha-receptor is more stable than that of PLC-gamma and the PDGF beta-receptor. However, PDGF stimulation results in a smaller fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma and a smaller accumulation of inositol trisphosphate in cells expressing the alpha-receptor as compared with cells expressing the beta-receptor. We conclude that phosphorylated Tyr-988 and Tyr-1018 in the PDGF alpha-receptor carboxyl-terminal tail bind PLC-gamma, but this association leads to only a relatively low level of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-gamma.",

In one family, the mutation I737T was in alpha helix 4 and in the other F725L was between helices 3 and 4. Neither mutation altered androgen binding as determined by assays of mutant AR in the patient's cultured genital skin fibroblasts or of recombinant mutant receptors transfected into COS cells. In transient cotransfection assays in CV1 cells, transactivation with the AR mutants at low concentrations of DHT was reduced several fold compared with wild-type AR but increased at higher concentrations. Defects in NH(2)-terminal/carboxy terminal interactions were identified in mammalian two hybrid assays. In similar assays, there was reduced binding of the p160 coactivators TIF2/SRC2 and SRC1 to the mutant AR ligand binding domains (LBD). In the family with AR I737T, sex phenotype varied from severely defective masculinization in the proband to a maternal great uncle whose only manifestation of AIS was severe gynecomastia. He was fertile and passed the mutation to two daughters. The proband of the F725L family was also incompletely masculinized but was raised as a male while his half-sibling by a different father was affected more severely and reared as a female. These studies indicate that the function of an AR AF2 mutant in male development can vary greatly depending on the genetic background.",

In contrast, the soluble type I cGK was unable to activate CFTR in intact cells, although both cGK I and cGK II could phosphorylate CFTR in vitro. To investigate the molecular basis for the cGK II isotype specificity of CFTR channel gating, we expressed cGK II or cGK I mutants possessing different membrane binding properties by using adenoviral vectors in a CFTR-transfected intestinal cell line, and we examined the ability of cGMP to phosphorylate and activate the Cl- channel. Mutation of the cGK II N-terminal myristoylation site (Gly2 --> Ala) reduced cGK II membrane binding and severely impaired cGK II activation of CFTR. Conversely, a chimeric protein, in which the N-terminal membrane-anchoring domain of cGK II was fused to the N terminus of cGK Ibeta, acquired the ability to associate with the membrane and activate the CFTR Cl- channel. The potency order of cGK constructs for activation of CFTR (cGK II > membrane-bound cGK I chimer > nonmyristoylated cGK II > cGK Ibeta) correlated with the extent of 32P incorporation into CFTR observed in parallel measurements. These results strongly support the concept that membrane targeting of cGK is a major determinant of CFTR Cl- channel activation in intact cells.",

In contrast, nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation leads to the sustained activation of the MAPKs and subsequently to neuronal differentiation. It has been shown that both the magnitude and longevity of MAPK activation governs the nature of the cellular response. The activations of MAPKs are dependent upon two distinct small G-proteins, Ras and Rap1, that link the growth factor receptors to the MAPK cascade by activating c-Raf and B-Raf, respectively. We found that Ras was transiently stimulated upon both EGF and NGF treatment of PC12 cells. However, EGF transiently activated Rap1, whereas NGF stimulated prolonged Rap1 activation. The activation of the ERKs was due almost exclusively (>90%) to the action of B-Raf. The transient activation of the MAPKs by EGF was a consequence of the formation of a short lived complex assembling on the EGF receptor itself, composed of Crk, C3G, Rap1, and B-Raf. In contrast, NGF stimulation of the cells resulted in the phosphorylation of FRS2. FRS2 scaffolded the assembly of a stable complex of Crk, C3G, Rap1, and B-Raf resulting in the prolonged activation of the MAPKs. Together, these data provide a signaling link between growth factor receptors and MAPK activation and a mechanistic explanation of the differential MAPK kinetics exhibited by these growth factors.",

ErbB2 is a unique receptor-tyrosine kinase that does not bind ligand but possesses an extracellular domain poised to engage other ErbBs. Little is known about the molecular mechanism for ErbB2 catalytic regulation. Here we show that ErbB2 kinase is strongly autoinhibited, and a loop connecting the alphaC helix and beta4 sheet within the kinase domain plays a major role in the control of kinase activity. Mutations of two Gly residues at positions 776 and 778 in this loop dramatically increase ErbB2 catalytic activity. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that mutational activation is due to approximately 10- and approximately 7-fold increases in ATP binding affinity and turnover number, respectively. Expression of the activated ErbB2 mutants in cells resulted in elevated ligand-independent ErbB2 autophosphorylation, ErbB3 phosphorylation, and stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Molecular modeling suggests that the ErbB2 kinase domain is stabilized in an inactive state via a hydrophobic interaction between the alphaC-beta4 and activation loops. Importantly, many ErbB2 human cancer mutations have been identified in the alphaC-beta4 loop, including the activating G776S mutation studied here. Our findings reveal a new kinase regulatory mechanism in which the alphaC-beta4 loop functions as an intramolecular switch that controls ErbB2 activity and suggests that loss of alphaC-beta4 loop-mediated autoinhibition is involved in oncogenic activation of ErbB2.",

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr kinase with multiple functions in the regulation of cell proliferation and transformation. In targeting adherens and tight junctions (TJs), CK2 modulates the strength and dynamics of epithelial cell-cell contacts. Occludin previously was identified as a substrate of CK2, however the functional consequences of CK2-dependent occludin phosphorylation on TJ function were unknown. RESULTS: Here, we present evidence that phosphorylation of a Thr400-XXX-Thr404-XXX-Ser408 motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of human occludin regulates assembly/disassembly and barrier properties of TJs. In contrast to wildtype and T400A/T404A/S408A-mutated occludin, a phospho-mimetic Occ-T400E/T404E/S408E construct was impaired in binding to ZO-2. Interestingly, pre-phosphorylation of a GST-Occ C-terminal domain fusion protein attenuated binding to ZO-2, whereas, binding to ZO-1 was not affected. Moreover, Occ-T400E/T404E/S408E showed delayed reassembly into TJs in Ca2+-switch experiments. Stable expression of Occ-T400E/T404E/S408E in MDCK C11 cells augments barrier properties in enhancing paracellular resistance in two-path impedance spectroscopy, whereas expression of wildtype and Occ-T400A/T404A/S408A did not affect transepithelial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role of CK2 in epithelial tight junction regulation. The occludin sequence motif at amino acids 400-408 apparently represents a hotspot for Ser/Thr-kinase phosphorylation and depending on the residue(s) which are phosphorylated it differentially modulates the functional properties of the TJ.",

A high stringency Scansite search of rat Cx43 identified the motif containing Ser373 (S373) as a 14-3-3 binding site. The S373 motif and the second best mode-1 motif, containing Ser244 (S244), are conserved in rat, mouse, human, chicken, and bovine, but not in Xenopus or zebrafish Cx43. Docking studies of a mouse/rat 14-3-3 homology model with the modeled phosphorylated S373 or S244 peptide ligands or their serine-to-alanine mutants, S373A or S244A, revealed that the pS373 motif facilitated a greater number of intermolecular contacts than the pS244 motif, thus supporting a stronger 14-3-3 binding interaction with the pS373 motif. The alanine substitution also reduced more than half the number of intermolecular contacts between 14-3-3 and the S373 motif, emphasizing the phosphorylation dependence of this interaction. Furthermore, the ability of the wild-type or the S244A GST-Cx43 C-terminal fusion protein, but not the S373A fusion protein, to interact with either 14-3-3 or 14-3-3zeta in GST pull-down experiments clearly demonstrated that the S373 motif mediates the direct interaction between Cx43 and 14-3-3 proteins. Blocking growth factor-induced Akt activation and presumably any Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the S373 motif in ROSE 199 cells did not prevent the down-regulation of Cx43-mediated cell-cell communication, suggesting that an Akt-mediated interaction with 14-3-3 was not involved in the disruption of Cx43 function.",

In the majority of cases, these disorders are caused by biallelic inactivating germline mutations in genes such as RAB27A (GS) and PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, and STXBP2 (F-HLH). Although monoallelic (ie, heterozygous) mutations have been identified in certain patients, the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms by which these mutations influence CTL and NK cell function remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize 2 novel monoallelic hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-associated mutations affecting codon 65 of STXPB2, the gene encoding Munc18-2, a member of the SEC/MUNC18 family. Unlike previously described Munc18-2 mutants, Munc18-2(R65Q) and Munc18-2(R65W) retain the ability to interact with and stabilize syntaxin 11. However, presence of Munc18-2(R65Q/W) in patient-derived lymphocytes and forced expression in control CTLs and NK cells diminishes degranulation and cytotoxic activity. Mechanistic studies reveal that mutations affecting R65 hinder membrane fusion in vitro by arresting the late steps of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-complex assembly. Collectively, these results reveal a direct role for SEC/MUNC18 proteins in promoting SNARE-complex assembly in vivo and suggest that STXBP2 R65 mutations operate in a novel dominant-negative fashion to impair lytic granule fusion and contribute to HLH.",

We demonstrate that in addition to GRK2, GRK3-6 can phosphorylate the Y326A mutant and rescue its sequestration; however, GRK1 was totally ineffective in rescuing either the phosphorylation or the sequestration of the mutant receptor. We found that the agonist-dependent rescue of Y326A mutant phosphorylation by GRK2, -3, and -5 was associated with the agonist-dependent rescue of sequestration. In contrast, overexpression of GRK4 and -6 led mainly to agonist-independent phosphorylation of the Y326A mutant accompanied by increased basal receptor sequestration.

METHODS: Recombinant CDC42 and a novel C-terminal fragment of IQGAP1 were expressed in, and purified from, Escherichia coli. Site directed mutagenesis was used to create coding sequences for three phosphomimicking variants (S1441E, S1443D and S1441E/S1443D) and to recapitulate a cancer-associated mutation (M1231I). These variant proteins were also expressed and purified. Protein-protein crosslinking using 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide was used to investigate interactions between the C-terminal fragment and CDC42. These interactions were quantified using surface plasmon resonance measurements. Molecular modelling was employed to make predictions about changes to the structure and flexibility of the protein which occur in the cancer-associated variant. RESULTS: The novel, C-terminal region of human IQGAP1 (residues 877-1558) is soluble following expression and purification. It is also capable of binding to CDC42, as judged by crosslinking experiments. Interaction appears to be strongest in the presence of added GTP. The three phosphomimicking mutants had different affinities for CDC42. S1441E had an approximately 200-fold reduction in affinity compared to wild type. This was caused largely by a dramatic reduction in the association rate constant. In contrast, both S1443D and the double variant S1441E/S1443D had similar affinities to the wild type. The cancer-associated variant, M1231I, also had a similar affinity to wild type. However, in the case of this variant, both the association and dissociation rate constants were reduced approximately 10-fold. Molecular modelling of the M1231I variant, based on the published crystal structure of part of the C-terminal region, revealed no gross structural changes compared to wild type (root mean square deviation of 0.564 \u00c5 over 5556 equivalent atoms). However, predictions of the flexibility of the polypeptide backbone suggested that some regions of the variant protein had greatly increased rigidity compared to wild type. One such region is a loop linking the proposed CDC42 binding site with the helix containing the altered residue. It is suggested that this increase in rigidity is responsible for the observed changes in association and dissociation rate constants. CONCLUSION: The consequences of introducing negative charge at Ser-1441 or Ser-1443 in IQGAP1 are different. The cancer-associated variant M1231I exerts its effects partly by rigidifying the protein.",

The present study was aimed at evaluating mechanistic role of MUC5AC on metastasis of lung cancer cells. Clinically, the overexpression of MUC5AC was observed in lung cancer patient tissues and was associated with poor survival. In addition, the overexpression of Muc5ac was also observed in genetically engineered mouse lung adenocarcinoma tissues (Kras(G12D); Trp53(R172H/+); AdCre) in comparison with normal lung tissues. Our functional studies showed that MUC5AC knockdown resulted in significantly decreased migration in two lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H1437) as compared with scramble cells. Expression of integrins (\u03b15, \u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b24 and \u03b25) was decreased in MUC5AC knockdown cells. As both integrins and MUC5AC have a von Willebrand factor domain, we assessed for possible interaction of MUC5AC and integrins in lung cancer cells. MUC5AC strongly interacted only with integrin \u03b24. The co-localization of MUC5AC and integrin \u03b24 was observed both in A549 lung cancer cells as well as genetically engineered mouse adenocarcinoma tissues. Activated integrins recruit focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that mediates metastatic downstream signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of FAK (Y397) was decreased in MUC5AC knockdown cells. MUC5AC/integrin \u03b24/FAK-mediated lung cancer cell migration was confirmed through experiments utilizing a phosphorylation (Y397)-specific FAK inhibitor. In conclusion, overexpression of MUC5AC is a poor prognostic marker in lung cancer. MUC5AC interacts with integrin \u03b24 that mediates phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 leading to lung cancer cell migration. ",

Here, we report that Rb is able to inhibit the kinase activity of immunopurified and gel-purified recombinant TAFII250. Rb inhibits the autophosphorylation of TAFII250 as well as its phosphorylation of the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF in a dose-responsive manner.

In addition, Rb appears to specifically inhibit the amino-terminal kinase domain of TAFII250 through a direct protein-protein interaction. We further demonstrate that two different tumor-derived Rb pocket mutants, C706F and Deltaex22, are functionally defective for kinase inhibition, even though they are able to bind the amino terminus of TAFII250.

Increased abundance of phosphorylated FADD in patient-derived tumor samples predicts poor clinical outcome. Using immunohistochemistry analysis and in vivo imaging of conditional mouse models of KRAS(G12D)-driven lung cancer, we found that the deletion of the gene encoding FADD suppressed tumor growth, reduced the proliferative index of cells, and decreased the activation of downstream effectors of the RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway that promote the cell cycle, including retinoblastoma (RB) and cyclin D1. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the induction of mitosis upon activation of KRAS required FADD and the phosphorylation of FADD by CK1\u03b1 (casein kinase 1\u03b1). Deleting the gene encoding CK1\u03b1 in KRAS mutant mice abrogated the phosphorylation of FADD and suppressed lung cancer development. Phosphorylated FADD was most abundant during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and mass spectrometry revealed that phosphorylated FADD interacted with kinases that mediate the G2/M transition, including PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1), AURKA (Aurora kinase A), and BUB1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1).

Previous biochemical studies employing Rdh54 purified from yeast cells have shown DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and DNA supercoiling by this protein, indicative of a DNA translocase function. Importantly, Rdh54 physically interacts with the Rad51 recombinase and promotes D-loop formation by the latter. Unfortunately, the low yield of Rdh54 from the yeast expression system has greatly hampered the progress on defining the functional interactions of this Swi2/Snf2-like factor with Rad51. Here we describe an E. coli expression system and purification scheme that together provide milligram quantities of nearly homogeneous Rdh54. Using this material, we demonstrate that Rdh54-mediated DNA supercoiling leads to transient DNA strand opening. Furthermore, at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, Rdh54 removes Rad51 from DNA. We furnish evidence that the Rad51 binding domain resides within the N terminus of Rdh54. Accordingly, N-terminal truncation mutants of Rdh54 that fail to bind Rad51 are also impaired for functional interactions with the latter. Interestingly, the rdh54 K352R mutation that ablates ATPase activity engenders a DNA repair defect even more severe than that seen in the rdh54Delta mutant. These results provide molecular information concerning the role of Rdh54 in homologous recombination and DNA repair, and they also demonstrate the functional significance of Rdh54.Rad51 complex formation. The Rdh54 expression and purification procedures described here should facilitate the functional dissection of this DNA recombination/repair factor.",

In order to elucidate the binding mode and substrate specificity in detail, biochemical and structural studies on human 5beta-reductase (h5beta-red; AKR1D1) have been recently undertaken. The crystal structure of a h5beta-red binary complex provides a complete picture of the NADPH-enzyme interactions involving the flexible loop B, which contributes to the maintenance of the cofactor in its binding site by acting as a \"safety belt\". Structural comparison with binary complexes of AKR1C enzymes, specifically the human type 3 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C2) and the mouse 17alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C21), also revealed particularities in loop B positioning that make the steroid-binding cavity of h5beta-red substantially larger than those of the two other enzymes. Kinetic characterization of the purified recombinant h5beta-red has shown that this enzyme exerts a strong activity toward progesterone (Prog) and androstenedione (Delta4) but is rapidly inhibited by these substrates once their concentrations reach 2-times their K(m) value. A crystal structure of the h5beta-red in ternary complex with NADPH and Delta4 has revealed that the large steroid-binding site of this enzyme also contains a subsite in which the Delta4 molecule is found. When bound in this subsite, Delta4 completely impedes the passage of another substrate molecule toward the catalytic site. The importance of this alternative binding site for the inhibition of h5beta-red was finally proven by site-directed mutagenesis, which demonstrated that the replacement of one of the residues delineating this site (Val(309)) by a phenylalanine completely abolishes the substrate inhibition. The results of this report provide structural insights into the substrate inhibition of h5beta-red by C19- and C21-steroids.",

In this study we have examined sequences in the GPIbalpha intracellular domain necessary for interaction of the receptor with filamin-1. We have identified two adjacent sequences involving amino acids 557-568 and 569-579 of the GPIbalpha cytoplasmic domain that are critical for normal association between the receptor complex and filamin-1.

Recently, a specific mutation in the retromer component VPS35, VPS35(D620N), has linked retromer dysfunction to familial autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson disease [2, 3]. However, the effect of this mutation on retromer function remains poorly characterized. Here we established that in cells expressing VPS35(D620N) there is a perturbation in endosome-to-TGN transport but not endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling, which we confirm in patient cells harboring the VPS35(D620N) mutation. Through comparative stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based analysis of wild-type VPS35 versus the VPS35(D620N) mutant interactomes, we establish that the major defect of the D620N mutation lies in the association to the actin-nucleating Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and SCAR homolog (WASH) complex. Moreover, using isothermal calorimetry, we establish that the primary defect of the VPS35(D620N) mutant is a 2.2 \u00b1 0.5-fold decrease in affinity for the WASH complex component FAM21. These data define the primary molecular defect in retromer assembly that arises from the VPS35(D620N) mutation and, by revealing functional effects on retromer-mediated endosome-to-TGN transport, provide new insight into retromer deregulation in Parkinson disease.",

GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), a GEC1 analog, also enhanced KOPR expression, but to a lesser extent. The MAP family proteins undergo cleavage of their C-terminal residue(s), and the exposed conserved glycine forms conjugates with phosphatidylethanolamine, which associate with membranes. Here, we examined whether such modifications were required for GEC1 and GABARAP to enhance hKOPR expression. When transiently transfected into CHO or Neuro2A cells, GEC1 and GABARAP were cleaved at the C termini. G116A mutation alone or combined with deletion of Lys(117) in GEC1 (GEC1-A) or Leu(117) in GABARAP (GABARAP-A) blocked their C-terminal cleavage, indicating that the conserved Gly(116) is necessary for C-terminal modification. The two GEC1 mutants enhanced hKOPR expression to similar extents as the wild-type GEC1; however, the two GABARAP mutants did not. Immunofluorescence studies showed that HA-GEC1, HA-GEC1-A, and HA-GABARAP were distributed in a punctate manner and co-localized with KOPR-EGFP in the Golgi apparatus, whereas HA-GABARAP-A did not. Pulldown assay of GST-KOPR-C-tail with HA-GEC1 or HA-GABARAP revealed that GEC1 had stronger association with KOPR-C-tail than GABARAP. These results suggest that because of its stronger binding for hKOPR, GEC1 is able to be recruited by hKOPR sufficiently without membrane association via its C-terminal modification; however, due to its weaker affinity for the hKOPR, GABARAP appears to require C-terminal modifications to enhance KOPR expression.",

This series of bicyclic pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines were designed in which there was a transposition of the 5-methyl group of PTX to the N9 position of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine. It was hypothesized that the N9-methyl group would preferentially interact with Ile123 of pcDHFR (and Ile123 of pjDHFR), but not with the shorter Val115 in hDHFR. Structure-activity data for this series of antifolates revealed that a trifluoro derivative (26) was the most selective against pjDHFR compared with mammalian DHFR (h/pj = 35.7). Structural data for the hDHFR-26 complex revealed that 26 binds in a different conformation from that observed in the pcDHFR-26 complex. In the hDHFR-26 complex the trifluorophenyl ring of 26 occupies a position near the cofactor-binding site, with close intermolecular contacts with Asp21, Ser59 and Ile60, whereas this ring in the pcDHFR-26 complex is positioned away from the cofactor site and near Ile65, with weaker contacts with Ile65, Phe69 and Ile123. Comparison of the intermolecular contacts between the N9-methyl group with Val115/Ile123 validates the hypothesis that the N9-methyl substituent preferentially interacts with Ile123 compared with Val115 of hDHFR, as the weaker contact with Val115 in the hDHFR structure is consistent with its weaker binding affinity compared with pcDHFR. The results for the structures of hDHFR-22 and pcDHFR-24 show that their inhibitor-binding orientation is similar to that observed in pcDHFR-26 and the pcDHFR variant (F69N) reported previously. The naphthyl moiety of 24 makes several intermolecular contacts with the active-site residues in pcDHFR that help to stabilize the binding, resulting in a more potent inhibitor.",

Cancer-specific mutations in the non-alpha isoforms of class I PI3K have not yet been identified, however overexpression of either wild-type p110beta, p110gamma or p110delta is sufficient to induce cellular transformation in chicken embryo fibroblasts. The mechanism whereby these non-alpha isoforms of class I mediate oncogenic signals is unknown.

A functional Erk pathway is required for p110gamma and p110beta transformation but not for transformation by p110delta or the H1047R mutant of p110alpha. Transformation and signaling by p110gamma and p110beta are sensitive to loss of interaction with Ras, which acts as a membrane anchor. Mutations in the C2 domain of p110delta reduce transformation, most likely by interfering with membrane association. Several small molecule inhibitors potently and specifically inhibit the oncogenic signaling and transformation of each of the class I PI3K, and, when used in combination with MEK inhibitors, can additively reduce the transformation induced by p110beta and p110gamma.",

We show that PEDF coprecipitation with glycosaminoglycans in media conditioned by human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells decreased after pretreatments with hyaluronidase, implying an association between HA and PEDF. Direct binding of human recombinant PEDF to highly purified HA was demonstrated by coprecipitation in the presence of cetylpyridinium chloride. Binding of PEDF to HA was concentration-dependent and saturable. The PEDF-HA interactions were sensitive to increasing NaCl concentrations, indicating an ionic nature of these interactions and having affinity higher than PEDF-heparin. Competition assays showed that PEDF can bind heparin and HA simultaneously. PEDF chemically modified with fluorescein retained the capacity for interacting with HA but lacked heparin affinity, suggesting one or more distinct HA-binding regions on PEDF. The HA-binding region was examined by site-directed mutagenesis. Single-point and cumulative alterations at basic residues within the putative HA-binding motif K189A/K191A/R194A/K197A drastically reduced the HA-binding activity without affecting heparin- or collagen I binding of PEDF. Cumulative alterations at sites critical for heparin binding (K146A/K147A/R149A) decreased HA affinity but not collagen I binding. Thus these clusters of basic residues (BXBXXBXXB and BX3AB2XB motifs) in PEDF are functional regions for binding HA. In the spatial PEDF structure they are located in distinct areas away from the collagen-binding site.

Phosphorylation of rat nephrin by the Fyn kinase markedly increased its interaction with a regulatory subunit of PI3K. Stable transfection of rat nephrin in the podocytes with podocin led to nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, increased Rac1 activity, and an altered actin cytoskeleton with decreased stress fibers and increased lamellipodia. These changes were reversed with an inhibitor of PI3K and not seen when the nephrin-mutant Y1152F replaced wild-type nephrin. Rac1 and Akt1 contributed to lamellipodia formation and decreased stress fibers, respectively. Finally, in the rat model of puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis, nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation, nephrin-PI3K association, and glomerular Akt phosphorylation were all decreased.

Insulin regulates GK activity by modulating its association with secretory granules, although little is known about the mechanisms involved in regulating this association. Using quantitative imaging of multicolor fluorescent proteins fused to GK, we found that the dynamic association of GK with secretory granules is modulated through nitric oxide (NO). Our results in cultured beta cells show that insulin stimulates NO production and leads to S-nitrosylation of GK. Furthermore, inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) activity blocks insulin-stimulated changes in both GK association with secretory granules and GK conformation. Mutation of cysteine 371 to serine blocks S-nitrosylation of GK and causes GK to remain tightly bound to secretory granules. GK was also found to interact stably with neuronal NOS as detected by coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Finally, attachment of a nuclear localization signal sequence to NOS drives GK to the nucleus in addition to its normal cytoplasmic and granule targeting. Together, these data suggest that the regulation of GK localization and activity in pancreatic beta cells is directly related to NO production and that the association of GK with secretory granules occurs through its interaction with NOS.",

Tra1 contains essential C-terminal PI3K and FATC domains, but unlike other PIKK (phosphoinositide three-kinase-related kinase) family members, lacks kinase activity. To analyze functions of the FATC domain, we selected for suppressors of tra1-F3744A, an allele that results in slow growth under numerous conditions of stress. Two alleles of TTI2, tti2-F328S and tti2-I336F, acted in a partially dominant fashion to suppress the growth-related phenotypes associated with tra1-F3744A as well as its resulting defects in transcription. tti2-F328S suppressed an additional FATC domain mutation (tra1-L3733A), but not a mutation in the PI3K domain or deletions of SAGA or NuA4 components. We find eGFP-tagged Tti2 distributed throughout the cell. Tti2 is a component of the ASTRA complex, and in mammalian cells associates with molecular chaperones in complex with Tti1 and Tel2. Consistent with this finding, Tra1 levels are reduced in a strain with a temperature-sensitive allele of tel2. Further agreeing with a possible role for Tti2 in the folding or stabilization of Tra1, tra1-F3744A was mislocalized to the cytoplasm, particularly under conditions of stress. Since an intragenic mutation of tra1-R3590I also suppressed F3744A, we propose that Tti2 is required for the folding/stability of the C-terminal FATC and PI3K domains of Tra1 into their functionally active form.",

It has been shown that extracellular N terminus of C5a receptor (C5aR) forms the binding domain for CHIPS, and tyrosine sulfation is emerging as a key factor in determining protein-protein interaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of tyrosine sulfation of N-terminal of C5aR in its binding with CHIPS. METHODS: Expression plasmids encoding C5aR and its mutants were prepared using PCR and site-directed mutagenesis and were used to transfect HEK 293T cells using calcium phosphate. Recombinant CHIPS protein was purified. Western blotting was used to examine the binding efficiency of CHIPS to C5aR or its mutants. RESULTS: CHIPS exclusively binds to C5aR, but not to C5L2 or C3aR. A nonspecific sulfation inhibitor, sodium chlorate (50 nmol/L), diminishes the binding ability of C5aR with CHIPS. Blocking sulfation by mutation of tyrosine to phenylalanine at positions 11 and 14 of C5aR N terminus, which blocked sulfation, completely abrogates CHIPS binding. When tyrosine 14 alone was mutated to phenylalanine, the binding efficiency of recombinant CHIPS was substantially decreased. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate a structural basis of C5aR-CHIPS association, in which tyrosine sulfation of N-terminal C5aR plays an important role. Our data may have potential significance in development of novel drugs for therapeutic intervention.",

All three PLs acted as agonists in heterologous bioassays, whereas in homologous bioassays in cells transfected with oGHRs they antagonized the oGH activity. Despite these differences, oGH and PLs bound with similar affinity to the oGHR extracellular domain (oGHR-ECD), indicating that the binding occurs through hormone site I. Gel filtration of complexes between oPL and oGHR-ECD showed a 1:1 stoichiometry, confirming this conclusion. The oPL T185D and bPL T188D, which exhibited weak biological activity mediated through GHRs, behaved as site I antagonists, whereas oPL G130R and bPL G133R formed a 1:1 complex with GHR-ECDs and bound to h/rb/oGHR-ECDs with affinity similar to that of wild-type oPL. They had no agonistic activity in all models transfected with h/rb and oGHRs, but were antagonistic to all of them. In conclusion, ruminant PLs antagonize the activity of oGH in homologous systems, because they cannot homodimerize oGHRs, whereas in heterologous systems they act as agonists. The structural analysis hints that minor differences in the sequence of the GHR-ECDs may account for this difference. Since the initial step in the activity transduced through cytokine/hemapoietic receptors family is receptor homodimerization or heterodimerization, we suggest that the question of homologous versus heterologous interactions should be reexamined.",

Rad51 and RecA share a core ATPase domain that is structurally similar to the ATPase domains of helicases and the F1 ATPase. Rad51 has an additional N-terminal domain, whereas RecA protein has an additional C-terminal domain. Here we show that glycine 103 in the N-terminal domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 is important for binding to single-stranded and duplex DNA. The Rad51-G103E mutant protein is deficient in DNA strand exchange and ATPase activity due to a primary DNA binding defect. The N-terminal domain of Rad51 is connected to the ATPase core through an extended elbow linker that ensures flexibility of the N-terminal domain. Molecular modeling of the Rad51-G103E mutant protein shows that the negatively charged glutamate residue lies on the surface of the N-terminal domain facing a positively charged patch composed of Arg-260, His-302, and Lys-305 on the ATPase core domain. A possible structural explanation for the DNA binding defect is that a charge interaction between Glu-103 and the positive patch restricts the flexibility of the N-terminal domain. Rad51-G103E was identified in a screen for Rad51 interaction-deficient mutants and was shown to ablate the Rad54 interaction in two-hybrid assays (Krejci, L., Damborsky, J., Thomsen, B., Duno, M., and Bendixen, C. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 966-976). Surprisingly, we found that the physical interaction of Rad51-G103E with Rad54 was not affected.

In the present study, we show, in three cell types, that Akt does not require its pleckstrin homology domain to respond to either insulin or platelet-derived growth factor. Moreover, attachment of the src myristoylation signal to target Akt, without its pleckstrin homology domain, to the membrane constitutively activates Akt by causing an increase in its basal level of phosphorylation. This constitutively active form of Akt can also activate p70(S6K), indicating that the pleckstrin homology domain is not necessary for downstream interactions. Fusion of the inter src homology 2 domain from the p85 regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to Akt also constitutively activated Akt and induced an association with the lipid kinase. Phosphorylation of this fusion protein still critically contributes toward its increased activity. The sum of these results indicates that the primary mechanism of Akt activation is via protein phosphorylation.",

Recent work demonstrating aluminum fluoride-induced complex formation between Ras and its GTPase-activating proteins (RasGAP and NF1) has provided important insights into the mechanism of GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. We have characterized the AlF4--induced complex formation between the GDP-bound form of the Rho subfamily G-protein Cdc42Hs and a limit functional domain of the Cdc42-GAP using a variety of biochemical techniques. Our results indicate that the apparent affinity of GAP for the AlF4--mediated complex is similar to the affinity observed for the activated (GTP-bound) form of Cdc42 and that beryllium (Be) can replace aluminum in mediating fluoride-induced complex formation. Additionally, the AlF4--induced interaction is weakened significantly by the catalytically compromised GAP(R305A) mutant, indicating that this arginine is critical in transition state stabilization. Unlike Ras, we find that AlF4- and BeF3- mediate complex formation between Cdc42Hs.GDP and downstream target/effector molecules, indicating that there are important differences in the mechanism of effector binding between the Ras and Rho subfamily G-proteins.",

Here we show that p53 is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase Aurora-A at serine 215. Unlike most identified phosphorylation sites of p53 that positively associate with p53 function (Brooks, C. L., and Gu, W. (2003) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 15, 164-171), the phosphorylation of p53 by Aurora-A at Ser-215 abrogates p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity. Downstream target genes of p53, such as p21Cip/WAF1 and PTEN, were inhibited by Aurora-A in a Ser-215 phosphorylation-dependent manner (i.e. phosphomimic p53-S215D lost and non-phosphorylatable p53-S215A retained normal p53 function). As a result, Aurora-A overrides the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by cisplatin and gamma-irradiation, respectively. However, the effect of Aurora-A on p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity was not affected by phosphorylation of Ser-315, a recently identified Aurora-A phosphorylation site of p53 (Katayama, H., Sasai, K., Kawai, H., Yuan, Z.

By use of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, CrkII was identified as a protein that specifically bound to Tyr900 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, possibly via the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. Expression of a mutant receptor where Tyr900 had been replaced with a phenylalanine residue (Y900F) resulted in a receptor with reduced ability to phosphorylate CrkII.

          "text": "The A2A adenosine receptor is a prototypical G(s)-coupled receptor, but it also signals, e.g. to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, via a pathway that is independent of heterotrimeric G proteins. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus affects the strength of the signal through these alternative pathways. In a yeast two-hybrid interaction hunt, we screened a human brain library for proteins that bound to the juxtamembrane portion of the carboxyl terminus of the A2A receptor. This approach identified ARNO/cytohesin-2, a nucleotide exchange factor for the small (monomeric) G proteins of the Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family, as a potential interaction partner. We confirmed a direct interaction by mutual pull down (of fusion proteins expressed in bacteria) and by immunoprecipitation of the proteins expressed in mammalian cells. To circumvent the long term toxicity associated with overexpression of ARNO/cytohesin-2, we created stable cell lines that stably expressed the A2A receptor and where ARNO/cytohesin-2 or the dominant negative version E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 was inducible by mifepristone. Cyclic AMP accumulation induced by an A2A-specific agonist was neither altered by ARNO/cytohesin-2 nor by the dominant negative version. This was also true for agonist-induced desensitization. In contrast, expression of dominant negative E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 and of dominant negative T27N-Arf6 abrogated the sustained phase of MAP kinase stimulation induced by the A2A receptor. We therefore conclude that ARNO/cytohesin-2 is required to support the alternative, heterotrimeric G protein-independent, signaling pathway of A2A receptor, which is stimulation of MAP kinase.",

We have studied the cytological distribution of these proteins in human cervical carcinoma cell lines using polyclonal anti-p53 and monoclonal anti-E6 antibodies. The antibody specificity was confirmed by immunoblot and immunocompetition analyses. The intracellular localization of p53 and E6 was detected using the techniques of conventional and three-dimensional confocal microscopy. In the HPV-18 or -16 integrated cell lines, HeLa, CaSki and SiHa, viral oncoprotein E6 and endogenous tumor-suppressor protein, p53, were observed by immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm; p53 also had a weak punctate staining in the nuclei of HeLa and CaSki cells. In the HPV-negative cervical carcinoma cell lines, C-33A and HT-3, which have mutated p53, p53 was localized predominantly to the nucleus, with C-33A cells having elevated levels of p53 compared with the other cell lines. High spatial resolution imaging, using confocal microscopy, was performed on the cells after double fluorescence staining for p53 (fluorescein) and E6 (rhodamine). The images showed that both p53 and E6 had similar cytoplasmic distributions, which implied that these two proteins may exist as a cytoplasmic complex. To substantiate this implication, fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy was performed, which provided direct evidence of a close association between p53 and E6 within individual HeLa cells. The results from this study support the theory that p53 protein binds HPV-16/18 E6 protein in the cell cytoplasm, thus preventing p53 from exerting its tumor-suppressor function in the nucleus. Hence, inactivation of wild-type p53 by p53-E6 complex formation in cervical cancer may be a critical step in malignant transformation.",

Recent studies demonstrated that DBC is phosphorylated at Thr454 by ATM/ATR kinases in response to DNA damage, which is a critical event for p53 activation and apoptosis. However, how DBC1 phosphorylation is regulated has not been studied. Here we show that protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) dephosphorylates DBC1, regulating its role in DNA damage response. PP4R2, a regulatory subunit of PP4, mediates the interaction between DBC1 and PP4C, a catalytic subunit. PP4C efficiently dephosphorylates pThr454 on DBC1 in vitro, and the depletion of PP4C/PP4R2 in cells alters the kinetics of DBC1 phosphorylation and p53 activation, and increases apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which are compatible with the expression of the phosphomimetic DBC-1 mutant (T454E). These suggest that the PP4-mediated dephosphorylation of DBC1 is necessary for efficient damage responses in cells.",

To elucidate whether dimerization is responsible for activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain or just plays a role in the stabilization of the active form, the activated status of wild-type EGFR moiety in the heterodimer with kinase activity-deficient mutant receptors was investigated. The kinase activity of the wild-type EGFR was partially activated by EGF in the heterodimer with intracellular domain deletion (sEGFR) or ATP binding-deficient mutant (K721A) EGFRs, while the wild-type EGFR in the heterodimer of wild-type and phosphate transfer activity-deficient mutant receptor D813N could be fully activated. After treatment with EGF, the ATP binding affinity and the V(max) of the wild-type EGFR increased. In the presence of sEGFR, a similar increase in the affinity for ATP was observed, but V(max) did not change.

          "text": "Abstract \u03b21 integrins play crucial roles in a variety of cell processes such as adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of lymphocytes. To understand the molecular mechanisms of these various biological effects, it is particularly important to analyze cell signaling through the \u03b21 integrins. Our previous study showed that PLC-\u03b3, pp125FAK (focal adhesion kinase), pp105, paxillin, p59fyn, p56lck, and ERK1/2 are phosphorylated in their tyrosine residues upon engagement of \u03b21 integrins. We identified pp105 as Cas (Crk-associated substrate)-related protein and successfully cloned its cDNA. pp105 is a Cas homologue predominantly expressed in the cells of lymphoid lineage, which led us to designate it Cas-L. Like p130Cas, Cas-L contains a single SH3 domain and multiple SH2-binding sites (YXXP motif), which are suggested to bind SH2 domains of Crk, Nck, and SHPTP2. Subsequent studies revealed that pp125FAK binds Cas-L on its SH3 domain and phosphorylates its tyrosine residues upon \u03b21 integrin stimulation. Since Cas-L is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes, it is conceivable that Cas-L plays an important role in lymphocyte-specific signals. We have shown that Cas-L is involved in the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 signaling pathway as well as the \u03b21 integrin signaling pathway. Cas-L is transiently phosphorylated following CD3 crosslinking and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L binds to Crk and C3G. Furthermore, a Cas-L mutant (Cas-L\u0394SH3), which lacks the binding site for FAK, is still tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 crosslinking but not upon \u03b21 integrin crosslinking, suggesting that FAK is not involved in CD3-dependent Cas-L phosphorylation. Finally, we have identified a crucial role of Cas-L in \u03b21 integrin-mediated T-cell co-stimulation. We have found that this co-stimulatory pathway is impaired in the Jurkat T-cell line, and that the expression level of Cas-L is reduced in the Jurkat cells compared to peripheral T-cells. The transfection of Cas-L cDNA into Jurkat cells restored the \u03b21 integrin-mediated co-stimulation, while the transfection of Cas-L\u0394SH3 mutant failed to do so, which contrasts with the case of CD3-mediated signaling. These results indicate that Cas-L plays a key role, through the association and phosphorylation by FAK, in \u03b21 integrin-mediated T-cell co-stimulation. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L is critical for T-cell receptor and \u03b21 integrin-induced T-lymphocyte migration. Taken together, Cas-L might be the bi-modal docking protein which assembles the signals through \u03b21 integrins and TCR/CD3, and which participates in a variety of T-cell functions.",

Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 295: C365-C377, 2008). In the current communication, we explore the probable mechanism by which Pnck induces ligand-independent EGFR degradation. Pnck-induced EGFR degradation is calcium/calmodulin independent and is regulated by cell density, with the highest EGFR degradation observed at low cell density. Pnck is a novel heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) client protein that can be co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp90. Treatment of Pnck-overexpressing cells with the pharmacologic Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin results in enhanced EGFR degradation, and destruction of Pnck. In cells in which Pnck is inducing EGFR degradation, we observed that Hsp90 exhibits reduced electrophoretic mobility, and through mass spectrometric analysis of immunopurified Hsp90 protein we demonstrated enhanced phosphorylation at threonine 89 and 616 (in both Hsp90-\u03b1 and -\u03b2) and serine 391 (in Hsp90-\u03b1). Kinase-active Pnck protein is degraded by the proteasome, concurrent with EGFR degradation. A Pnck mutant (T171A) protein with suppressed kinase activity induced EGFR degradation to essentially the same level as wild-type (WT) Pnck, suggesting that Pnck kinase activity is not required for the induction of EGFR degradation. Although EGFR is degraded, overexpression of WT Pnck paradoxically promoted cellular proliferation, whereas cells expressing mutant Pnck (T171A) were growth inhibited. WT Pnck promoted S to G(2) transition, but cells expressing the mutant exhibited higher residency time in S phase. Basal MAP kinase activity was inhibited by WT Pnck but not by mutant T171A Pnck protein. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21/Cip-1/Waf-1 was transcriptionally suppressed downstream to MAP kinase inhibition by WT Pnck, but not the mutant protein. Collectively, these data suggest that 1) Pnck induces ligand-independent EGFR degradation most likely through perturbation of Hsp90 chaperone activity due to Hsp90 phosphorylation, 2) EGFR degradation is coupled to proteasomal degradation of Pnck, and 3) modulation of basal MAP kinase activity, p21/Cip-1/Waf-1 expression, and cellular growth by Pnck is independent of Pnck-induced ligand-independent EGFR degradation.",

The T domain confers DNA-binding properties to Brachyury proteins, but little is known how these proteins regulate their target genes. We characterized a direct target gene of the Drosophila Brachyury-homolog Brachyenteron. Brachyenteron activates the homeobox gene orthopedia in a dose-dependent manner via multiple binding sites with the consensus (A/G)(A/T)(A/T)NTN(A/G)CAC(C/T)T. The sites and their A/T-rich flanking regions are conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. Reporter assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrate that Brachyenteron binding sites confer in part additive, in part synergistic effects on otp transcription levels. This suggests an interaction of Brachyenteron proteins on the DNA, which we could map to a conserved motif within the T domain. Mouse Brachyury also interacts with Brachyenteron through this motif. We further show that the Xenopus and mouse Brachyury homologs activate orthopedia expression when expressed in Drosophila embryonic cells. We propose that the mechanisms to achieve target gene expression through variable binding sites and through defined protein-protein interactions might be conserved for Brachyury relatives.",

Pocket proteins regulate the activity of E2F transcription factors during G1-S transition. Two mechanisms have been described: (i) pocket protein binding blocks the transactivation domain of activator E2Fs, inhibiting E2F-dependent transcription and (ii) E2F-bound pocket proteins can recruit chromatin remodeling proteins containing an LxCxE motif (x encoding any amino acid), resulting in active repression of E2F target genes. To investigate the importance of pRB's LxCxE-interacting motif in cell-cycle control and tumor suppression, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mice expressing a mutant pRB protein carrying an asparagine for phenylalanine substitution at position 750, abrogating LxCxE binding. Because p130 may compensate for loss of pRB, we studied pRB(N750F) activity in the presence and absence of p130. The pRB-LxCxE interaction was not required for cell-cycle arrest upon mitogen deprivation and cell-cell contact, but did contribute to RAS(V12)- and radiation-induced cell-cycle arrest. Remarkably, the pRB-LxCxE interaction was not required for suppression of in vitro and in vivo transformation, even in the absence of p130. These results indicate that pRB's tumor suppressor activity is not effectuated by active silencing of E2F target genes, but rather by regulation of activator E2Fs or another unidentified mechanism. Furthermore, the in vitro response of pocket protein-perturbed cells to mitogen deprivation and cell-cell contact seems a better predictor of tumor development than the response to ectopic RAS(V12) expression.

We show here that treatment of transformed human skin fibroblasts stably expressing CYP2E1 with the hsp90 inhibitor radicicol results in CYP2E1 degradation that is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Immunoadsorption of hsp90 from cytosol of HEK cells expressing the truncated CYP2E1(Delta3-29) yields coadsorption of CYP2E1(Delta3-29). Cotransfection of HEK cells with both the truncated CYP2E1 and the hsp70-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP results in CYP2E1(Delta3-29) degradation, and CYP2E1(Delta3-29) co-immunoadsorbs with myc-CHIP from cytosol of cotransfected cells.

Regarding the antiapoptotic mechanisms, we have recently demonstrated that alphaB-crystallin interacts with the procaspase-3 and partially processed procaspase-3 to repress caspase-3 activation. Here, we demonstrate that human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis through interactions with members of the Bcl-2 family. Using GST pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitations, we demonstrated that alpha-crystallins bind to Bax and Bcl-X(S) both in vitro and in vivo. Human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins display similar affinity to both proapoptotic regulators, and so are true with their antiapoptotic ability tested in human lens epithelial cells, human retina pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and rat embryonic myocardium cells (H9c2) under treatment of staurosporine, etoposide or sorbitol. Two prominent mutants, R116C in alphaA-crystallin and R120G, in alphaB-crystallin display much weaker affinity to Bax and Bcl-X(S). Through the interaction, alpha-crystallins prevent the translocation of Bax and Bcl-X(S) from cytosol into mitochondria during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. As a result, alpha-crystallins preserve the integrity of mitochondria, restrict release of cytochrome c, repress activation of caspase-3 and block degradation of PARP. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel antiapoptotic mechanism for alpha-crystallins.",

The truncated CT63 FGFR-1 mutant failed to mediate chemotaxis, but was in response to ligand stimulation capable of mediating proliferation of the cells, stimulation of MAP kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2, an FGFR-1 specific signaling molecule. The defect in migration-capacity of CT63 was not due to loss of Y766, and thereby PLC-gamma1 activation, since cells expressing the mutant Y766F FGFR-1 migrated as efficiently as the wild-type receptor cells. Induction of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity by the activated FGFR-1 was dependent on the presence of Y766, and was therefore also not critical for the chemotactic response. Although the FGFR-1 only very inefficiently mediates activation of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI 3-kinase), the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin suppressed wild-type FGFR-1 mediated migration. We conclude that the signal transduction pathway for FGFR-1 mediated migration is independent of phosphotyrosine residues in the receptor and requires activation of a wortmannin-sensitive enzyme.",

It is known that regions of disorder in crystal structures can be indicative of conformational flexibility within a molecule, and there are several such regions in G protein alpha subunits. The amino-terminal 29 residues of Galpha are alpha-helical only in the heterotrimer, where they contact the side of Gbeta, but little is known about the conformation of this region in the active GTP bound state. To address the role of the Galpha amino-terminus in G-protein activation and to investigate whether this region undergoes activation-dependent conformational changes, a site-directed cysteine mutagenesis study was carried out. Engineered Galpha(i1) proteins were created by first removing six native reactive cysteines to yield a mutant Galpha(i1)-C3S-C66A-C214S-C305S-C325A-C351I that no longer reacts with cysteine-directed labels. Several cysteine substitutions along the amino-terminal region were then introduced. All mutant proteins were shown to be folded properly and functional. An environmentally sensitive probe, Lucifer yellow, linked to these sites showed a fluorescence change upon interaction with Gbetagamma and with activation by AlF(4)(-). Other fluorescent probes of varying charge, size, and hydrophobicity linked to amino-terminal residues also revealed changes upon activation with bulkier probes reporting larger changes. Site-directed spin-labeling studies showed that the N-terminus of the Galpha subunit is dynamically disordered in the GDP bound state, but adopts a structure consistent with an alpha-helix upon interaction with Gbetagamma. Interaction of the resulting spin-labeled Galphabetagamma with photoactivated rhodopsin, followed by rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPgammaS binding, caused the amino-terminal domain of Galpha to revert to a dynamically disordered state similar to that of the GDP-bound form. Together these results suggest conformational changes occur in the amino-termini of Galpha(i) proteins upon subunit dissociation and upon activating conformational changes. These solution studies reveal insights into conformational changes that occur dynamically in solution.",

We recently reported on a p150 serine/threonine kinase (termed ROK alpha) binding RhoA only in its active GTP-bound state and on its cDNA; introduction of RhoA into HeLa cells resulted in translocation of the cytoplasmic kinase to plasma membranes, consistent with ROK alpha being a target for RhoA (T. Leung, E. Manser, L. Tan, and L. Lim, J. Biol. Chem. 256:29051-29054, 1995). Reanalysis of the cDNA revealed that ROK alpha contains an additional N-terminal region. We also isolated another cDNA which encoded a protein (ROK beta) with 90% identity to ROK alpha in the kinase domain. Both ROK alpha and ROK beta, which had a molecular mass of 160 kDa, contained a highly conserved cysteine/histidine-rich domain located within a putative pleckstrin homology domain. The kinases bound RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC but not Rac1 and Cdc42. The Rho-binding domain comprises about 30 amino acids. Mutations within this domain caused partial or complete loss of Rho binding. The morphological effects of ROK alpha were investigated by microinjecting HeLa cells with DNA constructs encoding various forms of ROK alpha. Full-length ROK alpha promoted formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, consistent with its being an effector of RhoA. ROK alpha truncated at the C terminus promoted this formation and also extensive condensation of actin microfilaments and nuclear disruption. The proteins exhibited protein kinase activity which was required for stress fiber formation; the kinase-dead ROK alpha K112A and N-terminally truncated mutants showed no such promotion. The latter mutant instead induced disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, accompanied by cell spreading. These effects were mediated by the C-terminal region containing Rho-binding, cysteine/histidine-rich, and pleckstrin homology domains. Thus, the multidomained ROK alpha appears to be involved in reorganization of the cytoskeleton, with the N and C termini acting as positive and negative regulators, respectively, of the kinase domain whose activity is crucial for formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes.",

When HEL cells were stimulated with thrombopoietin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), \u03b1IIb\u03b23 became activated as evidenced by binding of an activation-specific monoclonal antibody and soluble fibrinogen, adherence and spreading on fibrinogen, colocalization of \u03b23 integrin and kindlin-3 in focal adhesions, and enhanced \u03b23 integrin-kindlin-3 association in immunoprecipitates. Kindlin-3 knockdown impaired adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen. Stimulation of HEL cells with agonists significantly increased kindlin-3 phosphorylation as detected by mass spectrometric sequencing. Thr(482) or Ser(484) was identified as a phosphorylation site, which resides in a sequence not conserved in kindlin-1 or kindlin-2. These same residues were phosphorylated in kindlin-3 when platelets were stimulated with thrombin. When expressed in HEL cells, T482A/S484A kindlin-3 decreased soluble ligand binding and cell spreading on fibrinogen compared with wild-type kindlin-3. A membrane-permeable peptide containing residues 476-485 of kindlin-3 was introduced into HEL cells and platelets; adhesion and spreading of both cell types were blunted compared with a scrambled control peptide. These data identify a role of kindlin-3 phosphorylation in integrin \u03b23 activation and provide a basis for functional differences between kindlin-3 and the two other kindlin paralogs.",

Here, we present a new approach that combines quantitative interaction proteomics with global chromatin profiling to functionally characterize repressive chromatin modifying protein complexes in embryonic stem cells. We define binding stoichiometries of 9 new and 12 known interaction partners of PRC2 and 10 known and 29 new interaction partners of G9A-GLP, respectively. We demonstrate that PRC2 and G9A-GLP interact physically and share several interaction partners, including the zinc finger proteins ZNF518A and ZNF518B. Using global chromatin profiling by targeted mass spectrometry, we discover that even sub-stoichiometric binding partners such as ZNF518B can positively regulate global H3K9me2 levels. Biochemical analysis reveals that ZNF518B directly interacts with EZH2 and G9A.

However, the intriguing fact that p53 contributes to a pro-survival advantage of tumor cells under DNA damage conditions raises a critical question in radiation therapy for the 50% human cancers with intact p53 function. Herein, we reveal an anti-apoptotic role of mitochondrial p53 regulated by the cell cycle complex cyclin B1/Cdk1 in irradiated human colon cancer HCT116 cells with p53(+/+) status. Steady-state levels of p53 and cyclin B1/Cdk1 were identified in the mitochondria of many human and mouse cells, and their mitochondrial influx was significantly enhanced by radiation. The mitochondrial kinase activity of cyclin B1/Cdk1 was found to specifically phosphorylate p53 at Ser-315 residue, leading to enhanced mitochondrial ATP production and reduced mitochondrial apoptosis. The improved mitochondrial function can be blocked by transfection of mutant p53 Ser-315-Ala, or by siRNA knockdown of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 genes. Enforced translocation of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 into mitochondria with a mitochondrial-targeting-peptide increased levels of Ser-315 phosphorylation on mitochondrial p53, improved ATP production and decreased apoptosis by sequestering p53 from binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, reconstitution of wild-type p53 in p53-deficient HCT116 p53(-/-) cells resulted in an increased mitochondrial ATP production and suppression of apoptosis. Such phenomena were absent in the p53-deficient HCT116 p53(-/-) cells reconstituted with the mutant p53. These results demonstrate a unique anti-apoptotic function of mitochondrial p53 regulated by cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated Ser-315 phosphorylation in p53-wild-type tumor cells, which may provide insights for improving the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy, especially for tumors that retain p53.",

It previously had been reported, using lysine-721 mutants (K721), that kinase domain function was required for ErbB-mediated cell transformation. However, since these initial reports, several studies using aspartate-813 mutants (D813) have demonstrated the ability of kinase-impaired ErbB receptors to induce mitogenic signal transduction pathways and cell transformation in a ligand-dependent manner. To determine the necessity of ErbB receptor kinase domain catalytic activity in ligand-independent cell transformation, we created S3-v-ErbB-K(-), a kinase-impaired oncoprotein constructed by replacing aspartate-813 with alanine (D813A). Subcellular routing as well as cell surface membrane and nuclear localization of the S3-v-ErbB-K(-) mutant receptor were unaffected by impairment of kinase activity. In contrast, avian fibroblasts expressing S3-v-ErbB-K(-) do not form the characteristic transformation-specific phosphoprotein complex, or induce soft agar colony growth in vitro. These results suggest that in contrast to ligand-dependent oncogenic signaling, ligand-independent cell transformation by a constitutively activated mutant form of the EGF receptor requires receptor kinase catalytic activity. In addition, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation and assembly of downstream signaling complexes require tyrosine phosphorylation events that are directly mediated by oncogenic forms of the EGF receptor.",

The N terminus of the protein contains a PDZ and a proline-rich domain, two motifs known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. By using the yeast two-hybrid approach, we screened for proteins that interact with the N terminus of rPDZRhoGEF. The light chain 2 of microtubule-associated protein 1 (LC2) was the only protein identified from the screen that does not contain a type I PDZ-binding motif at its extreme C terminus (-(S/T)Xphi-COOH, where phi is a hydrophobic amino acid). However, the C terminus does conform to a type II-binding motif (-phiXphi). We report here that rPDZRhoGEF interacts with LC2 via the PDZ domain, and the interaction is abolished by mutations in the carboxylate-binding loop. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed using GST fusion protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitations. Expression of rPDZRhoGEF mutants that are unable to interact with proteins via the carboxylate-binding loop induced changes in cell morphology and actin organization. These mutants alter the activation of RhoGTPases, and coexpression of dominant-negative RhoGTPases prevent the morphological changes. Furthermore, in cells expressing wild type rPDZRhoGEF, drug-induced microtubule depolymerization produces changes in cell morphology that are similar to those induced by rPDZRhoGEF mutants. These results indicate that modulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of rPDZRhoGEF through interaction with microtubule-associated protein light chains may coordinate microtubule integrity and the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. This coordinated action of the actin and microtubular cytoskeletons is essential for the development and maintenance of neuronal polarity.",

Consistent with these findings, BCAR3 overexpression induced alterations in F-actin distribution and augmented both autophosphorylation and kinase activity of the Cdc42/Rac-responsive serine/threonine kinase PAK1. p130Cas-associated BCAR3 protein was detected in the estrogen-independent breast cancer cell line 578-T, but not in estrogen-dependent MCF7 or ZR-75-1 cells. Stable ZR-75-1 transfectants overexpressing BCAR3, but not vector-only transfectants, grew in the presence of the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780. Stable transfection with RacV12, a constitutively active form of Rac1, also induced antiestrogen resistance in ZR-75-1 cells. Transient transfection of BCAR3 in estrogen-dependent MCF7 cells induced activation of luciferase constructs containing the proximal 1745 or 163 bp but not 66 bp of the cyclin D1 promoter. Such cyclin D1 promoter activation was inhibited by dominant negative forms of Rac1 and PAK1. Overexpression of the PAK1 autoinhibitory domain (residues 83-149) but not an inactive PAK1 autoinhibitory domain point mutant (L107F) also blocked BCAR3-mediated cyclin D1 activation. These studies suggest that AND-34/BCAR3 induces antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cell lines by a Rac1- and PAK1-dependent pathway.",

By contrast, an R664X nonsense mutant of the bovine anion exchanger 1 (AE1) is retained in the ER and does not form aggresomes upon proteasome inhibition in transfected HEK293 cells.

It involves either translesion DNA synthesis initiated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen monoubiquitination or less well-characterized fork reversal and template switch mechanisms. Herein, we characterize a novel tolerance pathway requiring the tumor suppressor p53, the translesion polymerase \u03b9 (POL\u03b9), the ubiquitin ligase Rad5-related helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), and the SWI/SNF catalytic subunit (SNF2) translocase zinc finger ran-binding domain containing 3 (ZRANB3). This novel p53 activity is lost in the exonuclease-deficient but transcriptionally active p53(H115N) mutant. Wild-type p53, but not p53(H115N), associates with POL\u03b9 in vivo. Strikingly, the concerted action of p53 and POL\u03b9 decelerates nascent DNA elongation and promotes HLTF/ZRANB3-dependent recombination during unperturbed DNA replication. Particularly after cross-linker-induced replication stress, p53 and POL\u03b9 also act together to promote meiotic recombination enzyme 11 (MRE11)-dependent accumulation of (phospho-)replication protein A (RPA)-coated ssDNA. These results implicate a direct role of p53 in the processing of replication forks encountering obstacles on the template strand.

However, there has been no evidence for a direct interaction between B-Raf and Mek-1. We report here that different B-Raf isoforms can be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Mek-1 antisera in COS-1 cells and that the kinase activity of B-Raf is not required for its interaction with Mek-1. We also show that all B-Raf isoforms tested phosphorylate Mek-1 in a time-dependent manner, whereas kinase defective mutants fail to do so. Finally, we demonstrate that the constitutively activated S218D, S222D and S218D/S222D mutants of Mek-1 interact similarly with B-Raf.

Three types of alpha-synuclein mutations, A53T, A30P, and E46K, have been reported in familial PD. Wild-type alpha-synuclein accumulates at high concentrations in Lewy bodies, and this process is accelerated with mutated A53T alpha-synuclein. The accumulation of alpha-synuclein is thought to be toxic, and causes neuronal death when alpha-synuclein aggregates into protofibrils and fibrils. Lewy bodies contain not only alpha-synuclein, but also other proteins including 14-3-3 proteins and synphilin-1. 14-3-3 Proteins exist mainly as dimers and are related to intracellular signal transduction pathways. Synphilin-1 is known to interact with alpha-synuclein, promoting the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions like Lewy bodies in vitro. To investigate the colocalization of alpha-synuclein, synphilin-1, and 14-3-3 proteins, we performed immunohistochemical studies on alpha-synuclein, 14-3-3 proteins, and synphilin-1 in the brain and spinal cord of A53T transgenic mice. In homozygous mouse brains, alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was observed in the neuronal somata and processes in the medial part of the brainstem, deep cerebellar nuclei, and spinal cord. The distribution of 14-3-3 proteins and synphilin-1 immunoreactivity was similar to that of alpha-synuclein in the homozygous mice. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1 or 14-3-3 proteins were colocalized in the pons and spinal cord. These results indicate that the accumulation of mutant alpha-synuclein occurs in association with 14-3-3 proteins and synphilin-1, and may cause the sequestration of important proteins including 14-3-3 proteins and synphilin-1. The sequestration and subsequent decrease in 14-3-3 proteins and synphilin-1 levels may account for neuronal cell death.",

The ability of the receptor to interact with G proteins and to stimulate inositol phosphate responses was markedly impaired by alanine replacement of Asn298 and was reduced by replacement of Pro299 or Tyr302. The F301A mutant receptor exhibited normal G protein coupling and inositol phosphate responses, and the binding of the peptide antagonist, [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II, was only slightly affected. However, its affinity for angiotensin II and the nonpeptide antagonist losartan was reduced by an order of a magnitude, suggesting that angiotensin II and losartan share an intramembrane binding site, possibly through their aromatic moieties. None of the agonist-occupied mutant receptors, including Y302A and triple alanine replacements of Phe301, Tyr302, and Phe304, showed substantial changes in their internalization kinetics. These findings demonstrate that the NPLFY sequence of the type 1a angiotensin II receptor is not an important determinant of agonist-induced internalization.

In addition, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) failed to phosphorylate the Aur-A-unphosphorylatable FADD substitution mutant S203A, indicating that phosphorylation of S203 by Aur-A serves to prime FADD for Plk1-mediated phosphorylation at S194.

The cytoplasmic tail plays an important role in the modulation of PECAM-1 function. Mutation of tyrosine 663 or 686 in the cytoplasmic tail reduces phosphorylation and mutation of 686 is associated with a reduction in PECAM-1-mediated inhibition of cell migration (1). We have previously noted that these two tyrosine residues are surrounded by consensus sequences for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain binding (1, 2), and the experiments presented explore the potential for PECAM-1-Src and PECAM-1-SH2 domain interactions. PECAM-1 is more highly phosphorylated in endothelial cells overexpressing c-Src, and in in vitro kinase assays, c-Src can phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PECAM cytoplasmic tail fusion protein. The phosphorylated fusion protein associates with the bead-bound c-Src. This association appears to be mediated by Src-SH2 domain, because PECAM-1 can be precipitated by a GST-Src-SH2 affinity matrix. The binding to the GST-Src-SH2 affinity matrix correlates directly with the level of PECAM-1 phosphorylation, because more PECAM-1 is precipitated from c-Src overexpressors and from wild-type rather than Tyr663 --> Phe and Tyr686 --> Phe mutant PECAM-1 expressors. Yet unidentified phosphoproteins can also be coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type but not mutant PECAM-1. Finally, we note the similarity of the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain sequence to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif.

We describe the molecular basis of a novel variant BSS in a patient in which GPIb alpha was absent from the platelet surface but present in a soluble form in the plasma. DNA sequence analysis showed a homozygous dinucleotide deletion in the codon for Tyr 508 (TAT) in GPIb alpha. This mutation (GPIb alpha deltaAT) causes a frame shift that alters the amino acid sequence of GPIb alpha within its transmembrane region. The hydrophobic nature of the predicted transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail at the COOH terminal are altered before reaching a new premature stop codon 38 amino acids short of the wild-type peptide. Although GPIb alpha deltaAT was not detectable on the platelet surface, immunoprecipitation of plasma with specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) identified circulating GPIb alpha. Transient expression of recombinant GPIb alpha deltaAT in 293T cells also generated a soluble form of the protein. Moreover, when a plasmid encoding GPIb alpha deltaAT was transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the GP beta-IX complex, it failed to be expressed on the cell surface. Thus, a dinucleotide deletion in the codon for Tyr 508 causes a frameshift that alters the amino acid sequence of GPIb alpha starting within its transmembrane region, changes the hydrophobicity of the normal transmembrane region, and truncates the cytoplasmic domain affecting binding to the cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic proteins. This mutation affects anchoring of the GPIb alpha polypeptide in platelets and causes the observed BSS phenotype with circulating soluble GPIb alpha.",

The crystallographic structure of the N-terminal portion (residues 2-286) of the Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum MCM protein revealed a dodecameric assembly with two hexameric rings in a head-to-head configuration and a positively charged central channel proposed to encircle DNA molecules. A structure-guided alignment of the M. thermoautotrophicum and S. solfataricus MCM sequences identified positively charged amino acids in SsoMCM that could point to the center of the channel. These residues (Lys-129, Lys-134, His-146, and Lys-194) were changed to alanine. The purified mutant proteins were all found to form homo-hexamers in solution and to retain full ATPase activity. K129A, H146A, and K194A SsoMCMs are unable to bind DNA either in single- or double-stranded form in band shift assays and do not display helicase activity. In contrast, the substitution of lysine 134 to alanine affects only binding to duplex DNA molecules, whereas it has no effect on binding to single-stranded DNA and on the DNA unwinding activity. These results have important implications for the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the MCM DNA helicase action.",

Integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) acts as a fibrinogen receptor of platelets and mediates platelet aggregation. Platelet activation is required for alpha IIb beta 3 to shift from noncompetent to competent for binding soluble fibrinogen. The steps involved in this transition are poorly understood. We have studied a variant of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by absence of platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding. The patient's platelets did not bind fibrinogen after platelet activation by ADP or thrombin, though his platelets contained alpha IIb beta 3. However, isolated alpha IIb beta 3 was able to bind to an Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser affinity column, and binding of soluble fibrinogen to the patient's platelets could be triggered by modulators of alpha IIb beta 3 conformation such as the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide and alpha-chymotrypsin. These data suggested that a functional Arg-Gly-Asp binding site was present within alpha IIb beta 3 and that the patient's defect was not secondary to a blockade of alpha IIb beta 3 in a noncompetent conformational state. This was evocative of a defect in the coupling between platelet activation and alpha IIb beta 3 up-regulation. We therefore sequenced the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on platelet RNA, and found a T-->C mutation at nucleotide 2259, corresponding to a Ser-752-->Pro substitution. This mutation is likely to be responsible for the uncoupling of alpha IIb beta 3 from cellular activation because (i) it is not a polymorphism, (ii) it is the only mutation in the entire alpha IIb beta 3 sequence, and (iii) genetic analysis of the family showed that absence of the Pro-752 beta 3 allele was associated with the normal phenotype. Our data thus identify the C-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3 as an intrinsic element in the coupling between alpha IIb beta 3 and platelet activation.",

GATA2 is a transcription factor controlling pool size of HSCs. Of interest, continuous overexpression of GATA2 does not induce HSC proliferation. In this report, we demonstrate that GATA2 expression, in leukemic and normal hematopoietic cells, oscillates during the cell cycle, such that expression is high in S phase but low in G(1)/S and M phase. GATA2 binding to target Bcl-X gene also oscillates in accordance with GATA2 expression. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GATA2 fusion protein, we demonstrate cell-cycle-specific activity of proteasome-dependent degradation of GATA2. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting analysis demonstrated phosphorylation of GATA2 at cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-consensus motifs, S/T(0)P(+1), and interaction of GATA2 with Cdk2/cyclin A2-, Cdk2/cyclin A2-, and Cdk4/cyclin D1-phosphorylated GATA2 in vitro. Mutants in phosphorylation motifs exhibited altered expression profiles of GFP-GATA2 domain fusion proteins. These results indicate that GATA2 phosphorylation by Cdk/cyclin systems is responsible for the cell-cycle-dependent regulation of GATA2 expression, and suggest the possibility that a cell-cycle-specific \"on-off\" response of GATA2 expression may control hematopoietic-cell proliferation and survival.",

With the exception of bovine cardiac TnT, all known vertebrate TnT isoforms lack a thiol group, a property which makes the wild-type proteins unsuitable as cross-linking substrate. We generated a mutant human fast skeletal TnT in which Ser155 was changed to Cys (TnT-Cys155). Mutation of this residue in TnT as well as in vitro expression in Escherichia coli and purification of the recombinant mutant protein did not affect its biological properties in terms of in vitro binding to troponin I (TnI), troponin C (TnC), actin-tropomyosin (actin-Tm), and actomyosin ATPase activity. TnT-Cys155 was labeled with 4-maleimidobenzophenone (BP-TnT155) and photo-cross-linked to TnI, TnC, Tm, and all of the thin filament proteins. BP-TnT155 did not cross-link to Tm and showed weak Ca2+/Mg2+-independent cross-linking with TnI in the binary complex and in the presence of all thin filament protein components. BP-TnT155 showed Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cross-linking with TnC in the binary and ternary complexes and Ca2+-favored cross-linking with TnI in the ternary complex. Thus, residue 155 of TnT is within 10 A (the length of cross-linker) of TnC in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and comes within 10 A of both TnI and TnC in the presence of Ca2+. TnT residue 155 is in close proximity to or may even partly encompass the Tm binding site. These results suggest that TnT, in association with TnI, may participate in the \"information transfer\" mediated by the Ca2+ binding signal from TnC to Tm and the region around TnT residue 155 probably acts as a linker between troponin and actin-Tm in this signal transmission process. Our results also suggest that TnT contains at least one Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent TnC binding region located between its Tm and TnI binding regions. A recombinant truncated fragment of TnI, TnI96-181, containing amino acid residues 96-181 and labeled with BP at Cys-133, failed to cross-link with TnT, indicating that the region around Cys-133 of TnI is not involved in binary interaction with TnT.",

Mutations within this motif in human PMS2 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae PMS1 disrupted the endonuclease and mismatch repair activities of MLH1-PMS2 and MLH1-PMS1, respectively (Kadyrov et al. 2006, 2007; Erdeniz et al. 2007). As a first step in determining whether such an activity is required during meiosis, we made mutations in the MLH3 putative endonuclease domain motif (-D523N, -E529K) and found that single and double mutations conferred mlh3-null-like defects with respect to meiotic spore viability and crossing over. Yeast two-hybrid and chromatography analyses showed that the interaction between MLH1 and mlh3-D523N was maintained, suggesting that the mlh3-D523N mutation did not disrupt the stability of MLH3. The mlh3-D523N mutant also displayed a mutator phenotype in vegetative growth that was similar to mlh3Delta. Overexpression of this allele conferred a dominant-negative phenotype with respect to mismatch repair. These studies suggest that the putative endonuclease domain of MLH3 plays an important role in facilitating mismatch repair and meiotic crossing over.",

Yeast orthologues of CHMPs, including an ESCRT-III component Snf7, are required for the sorting of cargo proteins to intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. We have characterized a novel human ESCRT-III-related protein, designated CHMP7, which consists of 453 amino acid residues. CHMP7 contains an SNF7 domain and a distantly SNF7-related domain in its C-terminal half and N-terminal half respectively. Among the ten CHMP proteins classified previously in six subfamilies (CHMP1-CHMP6), the C-terminal SNF7 domain of CHMP7 is most similar to the SNF7 domain of CHMP6, which associates with CHMP4 proteins and EAP20, a component of ESCRT-II. Pull-down assays using lysates of HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney) cells that overexpressed Strep-tagged CHMP7 and GFP (green fluorescent protein)-fused CHMP4b (also named Shax1) revealed a positive interaction between the C-terminal half of CHMP7 and CHMP4b. However, interaction was not observed between CHMP7 and EAP20. Confocal fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that FLAG-CHMP7 is distributed in HeLa cells diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, but with some accumulation, especially in the perinuclear area. The distribution of FLAG-CHMP7 was altered to a cytoplasmic punctate pattern by overexpression of either CHMP4b-GFP or GFP-Vps4B(E235Q), a dominant-negative mutant of the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) Vps4B, and partially co-localized with them. Ubiquitinated proteins and endocytosed EGF accumulated in GFP-CHMP7-expressing cells. A dominant-negative effect of overexpressed GFP-CHMP7 was also observed in the release of virus-like particles from HEK-293T cells that transiently expressed the MLV (murine leukaemia virus) Gag protein.

In this paper we visualize for the first time a UvrB dimer in a gel retardation assay, with the second subunit (B2) more loosely bound than the subunit (B1) that interacts with the damage. A beta-hairpin motif in UvrB plays an important role in damage specific binding. Alanine substitutions of Y92 or Y93 in the beta-hairpin result in proteins that kill E. coli cells as a consequence of incision in non-damaged DNA. Apparently, both residues are needed to prevent binding of UvrB to non-damaged DNA. The lethality of Y93A results from UvrC-mediated incisions, whereas that of Y92A is due to incisions by Cho. This difference could be ascribed to a difference in stability of the B2 subunit in the mutant UvrB-DNA complexes. We show that for 3' incision UvrC needs to displace this second UvrB subunit from the complex, whereas Cho seems capable to incise the dimer-complex. Footprint analysis of the contacts of UvrB with damaged DNA revealed that the B2 subunit interacts with the flanking DNA at the 3' side of the lesion. The B2 subunit of mutant Y92A appeared to be more firmly associated with the DNA, indicating that even when B1 is bound to a lesion, the B2 subunit probes the adjacent DNA for presence of damage. We propose this to be a reflection of the process that the UvrB dimer uses to find lesions in the DNA. In addition to preventing binding to non-damaged DNA, the Y92 and Y93 residues appear also important for making specific contacts (of B1) with the damaged site. We show that the concerted action of the two tyrosines lead to a conformational change in the DNA surrounding the lesion, which is required for the 3' incision reaction.",

We detected several activated RTKs, including the ErbB family receptors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, and ErbB4. We found that pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of ErbB receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and expression resulted in decreased bacterial uptake and heterologous expression of EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB4 in Chinese ovary hamster (CHO-K1) cells, which do not express of EGFR and ErbB4; the decrease caused a significant increase in meningococcal invasion. Activation of EGFR and ErbB4 was mediated by transactivation via the common ligand HB-EGF (heparin-binding EGF-like ligand), which was significantly elevated in infected cell culture supernatants. We furthermore determined that N. meningitidis induced phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr845 independent of ligand binding, which required c-Src activation and was involved in mediating uptake of N. meningitidis into eukaryotic cells. Increased uptake was repressed by expression of EGFR Y845F, which harbored a point mutation in the kinase domain. In addition, activation of ErbB4 at its autophosphorylation site, Tyr1284, and phosphorylation of ErbB2 Thr686 were observed. Altogether, our results provide evidence that EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4 are activated in response to N. meningitidis infection and shed new light on the role of ErbB signaling in meningococcal infection biology.",

However, some reports show that overexpression of TSG101 inhibits virus release by disruption of Gag targeting process. Since a HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpr binds to Gag p6 domain at the position close to the binding site for TSG101, whether Vpr implicates TSG101 overexpression effect has not been investigated. Here, we found that Vpr abrogates TSG101 overexpression effect to rescue viral production. Co-transfection of TSG101 and Gag with Vpr prevented TSG101-induced Gag accumulation in endosomes and lysosomes. In addition, Vpr rescued virus-like particle (VLP) production in a similar manner as a lysosomal inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1 indicating that Vpr inhibits TSG101-induced Gag downregulation via lysosomal pathway. Vpr and Gag interaction is required to counteract TSG101 overexpression effect since Vpr A30F mutant which is unable to interact with Gag and incorporate into virions, reduced ability to prevent Gag accumulation and to rescue VLP production. In addition, GST pull-down assays and Biacore analysis revealed that Vpr competed with TSG101 for Gag binding. These results indicate that Vpr overcomes the effects of TSG101 overexpression to support viral production by competing with TSG101 to bind Gag. ",

The discovery of genes responsible for familial forms of the disease has provided insights into its pathogenesis. Mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of specific protein substrates, have been found in nearly 50% of patients with autosomal-recessive early-onset parkinsonism. The abnormal accumulation of substrates due to loss of Parkin function may be the cause of neurodegeneration in parkin-related parkinsonism. Here, we demonstrate that Parkin interacts with, ubiquitylates and promotes the degradation of p38, a key structural component of the mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. We found that the ubiquitylation of p38 is abrogated by truncated variants of Parkin lacking essential functional domains, but not by the pathogenic Lys161Asn point mutant. Expression of p38 in COS7 cells resulted in the formation of aggresome-like inclusions in which Parkin was systematically sequestered. In the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cell line, Parkin promoted the formation of ubiquitylated p38-positive inclusions. Moreover, the overexpression of p38 in SH-SY5Y cells caused significant cell death against which Parkin provided protection. Analysis of p38 expression in the human adult midbrain revealed strong immunoreactivity in normal dopaminergic neurons and the labeling of LBs in idiopathic PD. This suggests that p38 plays a role in the pathogenesis of PD, opening the way for a detailed examination of its potential non-canonical role in neurodegeneration.",

Here we observe that the docking protein GAB1 is hyper-phosphorylated in carcinomas from transgenic mice and in cell lines expressing these ERBB2 cancer mutants. Using dominant negative GAB1 mutants lacking canonical tyrosine residues for SHP2 and PI3K interactions or lentiviral shRNA that targets GAB1, we demonstrate that GAB1 phosphorylation is required for ERBB2 mutant-induced cell signaling, cell transformation, and tumorigenesis. An enzyme kinetic analysis comparing ERBB2(YVMA) to wild type using physiologically relevant peptide substrates reveals that ERBB2(YVMA) kinase adopts a striking preference for GAB1 phosphorylation sites as evidenced by \u223c150-fold increases in the specificity constants (kcat/Km) for several GAB1 peptides, and this change in substrate selectivity was predominantly attributed to the peptide binding affinities as reflected by the apparent Km values. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ERBB2(YVMA) phosphorylates GAB1 protein \u223c70-fold faster than wild type ERBB2 in vitro. Notably, the mutation does not significantly alter the Km for ATP or sensitivity to lapatinib, suggesting that, unlike EGFR lung cancer mutants, the ATP binding cleft of the kinase is not significantly changed. Taken together, our results indicate that the acquired substrate preference for GAB1 is critical for the ERBB2 mutant-induced oncogenesis.",

EGFR is highly expressed in basal-like TNBC and is considered as a potential therapeutic target. However, EGFR targeting exerts only marginal clinical benefits, possibly due to activation of compensatory signaling pathways, which are frequently associated with HER3 upregulation. Here we show that concomitant targeting of EGFR and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases PYK2/FAK synergistically inhibits the proliferation of basal-like TNBC cells in vitro and attenuates tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Dual targeting of EGFR and PYK2/FAK inhibited complementary key growth and survival pathways mediated by AKT, S6K, STAT3, and ERK1/2 activation. PYK2 inhibition also abrogated HER3 upregulation in response to EGFR antagonists, thereby circumventing HER3-associated drug resistance. Mechanistically, PYK2 inhibition facilitated the proteasomal degradation of HER3 while inducing upregulation of NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated 1 gene). NDRG1 enhanced the interaction of HER3 with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, while PYK2, which interacts with NEDD4 and HER3, interfered with NEDD4-HER3 binding, suggesting that the PYK2-NDRG1-NEDD4 circuit has a critical role in receptor degradation, drug response, and resistance mechanism.

Here, we identify polo-like kinase (Plk) 3 as a new interaction partner of the death receptor CD95. The enzymatic activity of Plk3 increases following interaction of the CD95 receptor with its ligand. Knockout (KO) or knockdown of caspase-8, CD95 or FADD prevents activation of Plk3 upon CD95 stimulation, suggesting a requirement of a functional DISC for Plk3 activation. Furthermore, we identify caspase-8 as a new substrate for Plk3. Phosphorylation occurs on T273 and results in stimulation of caspase-8 proapoptotic function. Stimulation of CD95 in cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable caspase-8-T273A mutant in a rescue experiment or in Plk3-KO cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 reduces the processing of caspase-8 prominently. Low T273 phosphorylation correlates significantly with low Plk3 expression in a cohort of 95 anal tumor patients.

Neither the mechanism of KaiA-stimulated KaiC phosphorylation nor that of KaiB-mediated KaiC dephosphorylation is understood in detail at present. We demonstrate here that the A422V KaiC mutant sheds light on the former mechanism. It was previously reported that A422V is less sensitive to dark pulse-induced phase resetting and has a reduced amplitude of the KaiC phosphorylation rhythm in vivo. A422 maps to a loop (422-loop) that continues toward the phosphorylation sites. By pulling on the C-terminal peptide of KaiC (A-loop), KaiA removes restraints from the adjacent 422-loop whose increased flexibility indirectly promotes kinase activity. We found in the crystal structure that A422V KaiC lacks phosphorylation at S431 and exhibits a subtle, local conformational change relative to wild-type KaiC. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate higher mobility of the 422-loop in the absence of the A-loop and mobility differences in other areas associated with phosphorylation activity between wild-type and mutant KaiCs. The A-loop-422-loop relay that informs KaiC phosphorylation sites of KaiA dimer binding propagates to loops from neighboring KaiC subunits, thus providing support for a concerted allosteric mechanism of phosphorylation.",

We have previously demonstrated a link between JC virus strains Mad-1 and Delta98 and colorectal cancer. Others have also associated the virus to the induction of colon cancer and aneuploid brain tumors by producing a highly tumorigenic protein named T antigen (TAg), which binds to beta-catenin and inactivates key proteins such as p53. The aim is to demonstrate that JC virus is capable of inducing chromosomal instability in colonic cells. We used the human colon cancer cell line RKO as a model. The cell line has wild-type p53, wild-type beta-catenin and APC and is diploid. Neuroblastoma JCI cells, which are infected with the virus, VA13 fibroblasts, which are transformed by the SV40 TAg, were used as positive controls. HCT116, which has mutated beta-catenin, and SW480, which is a model of CIN, were also used as controls. The genomes of the Mad-1 and Delta98 strains were transfected into cells. As negative controls we used pUC or no plasmids. Cells were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days after transfection. PCR was used for the detection of TAg and the regulatory region DNA sequences at different time frames and Southern blot of whole genomic extracts for viral DNA integration into the host genome. Immunofluorescence and Western blot were performed for TAg, viral capsid proteins, and nuclear beta-catenin expressions, whereas coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect protein interactions. Karyotype analysis and electron microscopy were performed to seek chromosomal instability and cell abnormalities, respectively. Retention of viral sequences was observed for Mad-1- and Delta98-transfected RKO cells at all time frames with PCR only, whereas Southern blot analysis showed nonintegrated sequences at T7 alone. TAg and capsid protein expressions, as well as increased p53 and nuclear beta-catenin, were observed between T0 and T7 for Mad-1 and Delta98 alone. Also, interaction between TAg and both p53 and beta-catenin was also observed between T0 and T7. Chromosomal instability, characterized by chromosomal breakage, dicentric chromosomes, and increasing ploidy, was observed at all time frames for Mad-1 and Delta98, as well as cell abnormalities. In conclusion, we demonstrate that JC virus Mad-1 and Delta98 are able to induce chromosomal instability in colonic cells with a hit and run mechanism that involves an early interaction with beta-catenin and p53.",

Both differ in only one residue (Asp(116) and His(116), respectively) in the F-pocket that accommodates the peptide C terminus. Several different effects of the Asp(116) --> His replacement are observed. The bulkier His(116) induces a movement of peptide C-terminal pLys(9), allowing the formation of a novel salt bridge to Asp(77), whereas the salt bridge between pLys(9) and Asp(116) is converted into a hydrogen bond with His(116). His(116) but not Asp(116) adopts two alternative conformations, one of which leads to breakage of hydrogen bonds. Water molecules near residue 116 differ with regard to number, position, and contacts made. Furthermore, F-pocket atoms exhibit higher B-factors in B*2709 than in B*2705, indicating an increased flexibility of the entire region in the former subtype.

Adaptor protein 2 (AP2), a clathrin binding heterotetrameric protein comprised of \u03b1, \u03b22, \u03bc2 and \u03c32 subunits, facilitates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Mutation of the LLKIL motif in the CXCR2 carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) results in loss of AP2 binding to the receptor and loss of ligand-mediated receptor internalization and chemotaxis. AP2 knockdown also results in diminished ligand-mediated CXCR2 internalization, polarization and chemotaxis. Using knockdown/rescue approaches with AP2-\u03bc2 mutants, the binding domains were characterized in reference to CXCR2 internalization and chemotaxis. When in an open conformation, \u03bc2 Patch 1 and Patch 2 domains bind tightly to membrane PIP2 phospholipids. When AP2-\u03bc2, is replaced with \u03bc2 mutated in Patch 1 and/or Patch 2 domains, ligand-mediated receptor binding and internalization are not lost. However, chemotaxis requires AP2-\u03bc2 Patch 1, but not Patch 2. AP2-\u03c32 has been demonstrated to bind dileucine motifs to facilitate internalization. Expression of AP2-\u03c32 V88D and V98S dominant negative mutants resulted in loss of CXCR2 mediated chemotaxis. Thus, AP2 binding to both membrane phosphatidylinositol phospholipids and dileucine motifs is crucial for directional migration or chemotaxis.

Yeast two-hybrid analyses and GST pulldown assays reveal that the LL signal constitutes a binding site for the beta2-adaptin subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex, implicating this motif in targeting of GLUT8 to clathrin-coated vesicles. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays provide evidence that the binding site for the LL motif maps to the appendage domain of beta2-adaptin. To analyze the biological significance of the LL/beta2 interaction, we utilized RNA interference to specifically knockdown AP-2. Our results show that RNAi-mediated targeting of the mu2 subunit leads to cellular depletion of AP-2, but not AP-1 adaptor complexes in HeLa cells. As a consequence, GLUT8 accumulates at the plasma membrane at comparable levels to those observed in K44A-transfected cells. Conversely, the intracellular localization of mutant GLUT8-LL/AA is restored by replacing the LL motif in GLUT8 with the transferrin receptor-derived mu2-adaptin binding motif YTRF, indicating that for endocytosis both AP-2 binding motifs can substitute for each other. Thus, our data demonstrate that recruitment of GLUT8 to the endocytic machinery occurs via direct interaction of the dileucine motif with beta2-adaptin, and that endocytosis might be the main site at which GLUT8 is likely to be regulated.",

Two NRPs have been reported so far, NRP1 and NRP2. Unlike NRP1, little is known about NRP2 interactions with its ligands, VEGF165 and SEMA3F. Cell binding studies reveal that VEGF165 and SEMA3F bind NRP2 with similar affinities, 5.2 and 3.9 nM, respectively, and are competitive NRP2 ligands. Immunoprecipitation studies show that the B (b1b2) extracellular domain of NRP2 is sufficient for VEGF165 binding, whereas SEMA3F requires both the A (a1a2) and B domains. To identify residues of B-NRP2 involved in VEGF165 binding, point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. VEGF165 is a basic protein. Reduction of the electronegative potential of B-NRP2 by exchanging acidic residues for uncharged alanine (B-NRP2 E284A,E291A) in the 280-290 b1-NRP2 loop resulted in a 2-fold reduction in VEGF165 affinity. Conversely, enhancing the electronegative potential (B-NRP2 R287E,N290D and R287E,N290S) significantly increased VEGF165 affinity for B-NRP2 by 8- and 6.6-fold, respectively. The mutagenesis did not affect SEMA3F/B-NRP2 interactions. These results demonstrate that it is possible to alter VEGF165 affinity for NRP2 without affecting SEMA3F affinity. They also identify NRP2 residues involved in VEGF165 binding and suggest that modifications of B-NRP2 could lead to potentially high affinity selective inhibitors of VEGF165/NRP2 interactions.",

Conservative Lys-->Arg substitutions at both Lys-21 and Lys-22 produce dominant-negative mutants of I kappa B alpha in vivo.

Recently, the integrin beta3 cytodomain and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) kinase type 1gamma (a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-synthesizing enzyme) were shown to bind to the talin FERM domain (subdomain F3). We have characterized the PIP kinase-binding site by NMR using a 15N-labeled talin F2F3 polypeptide. A PIP kinase peptide containing the minimal talin-binding site formed a 1:1 complex with F2F3, causing a substantial number of chemical shift changes. In particular, two of the three Arg residues (Arg339 and Arg358), four of eight Ile residues, and one of seven Val residues in F3 were affected. Although a R339A mutation did not affect the exchange kinetics, R358A or R358K mutations markedly weakened binding. The Kd for the interaction determined by Trp fluorescence was 6 microm, and the R358A mutation increased the Kd to 35 microm. Comparison of these results with those of the crystal structure of a beta3-integrin cytodomain talin F2F3 chimera shows that both PIP kinase and integrins bind to the same surface of the talin F3 subdomain. Indeed, binding of talin present in rat brain extracts to a glutathione S-transferase integrin beta1-cytodomain polypeptide was inhibited by the PIP kinase peptide. The results suggest that ternary complex formation with a single talin FERM domain is unlikely, although both integrins and PIP kinase may bind simultaneously to the talin anti-parallel dimer.",

All CMSs with a kinetic abnormality of AChR, as well as many CMSs with a deficiency of AChR, have been traced to mutations in AChR-subunit genes. However, in a subset of patients with EP AChR deficiency, the genetic defect has remained elusive. Rapsyn, a 43-kDa postsynaptic protein, plays an essential role in the clustering of AChR at the EP. Seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) of rapsyn subserve self-association, a coiled-coil domain binds to AChR, and a RING-H2 domain associates with beta-dystroglycan and links rapsyn to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton. Rapsyn self-association precedes recruitment of AChR to rapsyn clusters. In four patients with EP AChR deficiency but with no mutations in AChR subunits, we identify three recessive rapsyn mutations: one patient carries L14P in TPR1 and N88K in TPR3; two are homozygous for N88K; and one carries N88K and 553ins5, which frameshifts in TPR5. EP studies in each case show decreased staining for rapsyn and AChR, as well as impaired postsynaptic morphological development.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the genetic cause and clinical spectrum of Hz/Hc. METHODS: Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene sequencing was performed in 14 patients with Hz/Hc, and their clinical phenotype was compared with that of 11 patients with pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome. PSTPIP1-pyrin interactions were analyzed by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. A structural model of the PSTPIP1 dimer was generated. Cytokine profiles were analyzed by using the multiplex immunoassay, and MRP8/14 serum concentrations were analyzed by using an ELISA. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were heterozygous for a missense mutation in the PSTPIP1 gene, resulting in a p.E250K mutation, and 1 carried a mutation resulting in p.E257K. Both mutations substantially alter the electrostatic potential of the PSTPIP1 dimer model in a region critical for protein-protein interaction. Patients with Hz/Hc have extremely high MRP8/14 concentrations (2045 \u00b1 1300 \u03bcg/mL) compared with those with PAPA syndrome (116 \u00b1 74 \u03bcg/mL) and have a distinct clinical phenotype. A specific cytokine profile is associated with Hz/Hc. Hz/Hc mutations altered protein binding of PSTPIP1, increasing interaction with pyrin through phosphorylation of PSTPIP1. CONCLUSION: Mutations resulting in charge reversal in the y-domain of PSTPIP1 (E\u2192K) and increased interaction with pyrin cause a distinct autoinflammatory disorder defined by clinical and biochemical features not found in patients with PAPA syndrome, indicating a unique genotype-phenotype correlation for mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene. This is the first inborn autoinflammatory syndrome in which inflammation is driven by uncontrolled release of members of the alarmin family.",

Because of the large number of serine/threonine residues, position-by-position analysis of these potential phosphorylation sites by mutagenesis is difficult. To circumvent this, we have employed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry techniques to scan for serine and threonine residues that are phosphorylated in full-length human IRS-1 ectopically expressed in cells using an adenoviral vector. This approach revealed 12 phosphorylation sites on serine or threonine residues, 10 of which were novel sites. Seven of these sites were in proline-directed motifs, whereas five were in arginine-directed sites. Sequence inspection suggested that phosphorylation of Ser1223 might alter the interaction of IRS-1 with the protein tyrosine phosphatase Src homology domain 2 (SH2)-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2). Mutation of Ser1223 to alanine to prevent phosphorylation resulted in increased association of SHP-2 with IRS-1, decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in CHO/IR cells, and decreased insulin-stimulated association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase with IRS-1. This mutation had no effect on association of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor. Sequence analysis showed the Ser1223 region to be widely conserved evolutionarily. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser1223 dampens association of IRS-1 with SHP-2, thereby increasing net insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.",

We describe here a novel interaction between SHIP2 and the p130(Cas) adapter protein, a mediator of actin cytoskeleton organization. SHIP2 and p130(Cas) association was detected in anti-SHIP2 immunoprecipitates from several cell types. Reattachment of trypsinized cells stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 and increased the formation of a complex containing SHIP2 and a faster-migrating tyrosine-phosphorylated form of p130(Cas). The faster-migrating form of p130(Cas) was no longer recognized by antibodies to the amino terminus of p130(Cas) and appeared to be generated through proteolysis. Interaction of the SHIP2 protein with the various forms of p130(Cas) was mediated primarily through the SH2 domain of SHIP2. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that SHIP2 localized to focal contacts and to lamellipodia. Increased adhesion was observed in HeLa cells transiently expressing exogenous WT-SHIP2. These effects were not seen with SHIP2 possessing a mutation in the SH2 domain (R47G). Transfection of a catalytic domain deletion mutant of SHIP2 (DeltaRV) inhibited cell spreading.

Triadin is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle that interacts with both calsequestrin and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) to communicate changes in luminal Ca(2+) to the release machinery. However, the potential impact of the triadin association with RyR1 in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling remains elusive. Here we show that triadin binding to RyR1 is critically important for rapid Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling. To assess the functional impact of the triadin-RyR1 interaction, we expressed RyR1 mutants in which one or more of three negatively charged residues (D4878, D4907, and E4908) in the terminal RyR1 intraluminal loop were mutated to alanines in RyR1-null (dyspedic) myotubes. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that triadin, but not junctin, binding to RyR1 was abolished in the triple (D4878A/D4907A/E4908A) mutant and one of the double (D4907A/E4908A) mutants, partially reduced in the D4878A/D4907A double mutant, but not affected by either individual (D4878A, D4907A, E4908A) mutations or the D4878A/E4908A double mutation. Functional studies revealed that the rate of voltage- and ligand-gated SR Ca(2+) release were reduced in proportion to the degree of interruption in triadin binding. Ryanodine binding, single channel recording, and calcium release experiments conducted on WT and triple mutant channels in the absence of triadin demonstrated that the luminal loop mutations do not directly alter RyR1 function. These findings demonstrate that junctin and triadin bind to different sites on RyR1 and that triadin plays an important role in ensuring rapid Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.",

FOG-1 physically interacts with GATA-1 to augment or inhibit its activity. The mechanisms by which FOG-1 regulates GATA-1 function are unknown. By using an assay that is based on the phenotypic rescue of a GATA-1-null erythroid cell line, we found that a conditional form of GATA-1 (GATA-1-ER) strongly induced histone acetylation at the beta-major globin promoter in vivo, consistent with previous results. In contrast, GATA-1 bearing a point mutation that impairs FOG-1 binding [GATA-1(V205M)-ER] failed to induce high levels of histone acetylation at this site. However, at DNase I-hypersensitive site (HS)3 of the beta-globin locus control region, GATA-1-induced histone acetylation was FOG-1-independent. Because the V205M mutation does not disrupt GATA-1 binding to DNA templates in vitro, we were surprised to find that in vivo GATA-1(V205M)-ER fails to bind the beta-globin promoter. However, at HS3, DNA binding by GATA-1 was FOG-1-independent, thus correlating histone acetylation with GATA-1 occupancy. Examination of additional GATA-1-dependent regulatory elements showed that the interaction with FOG-1 is required for GATA-1 occupancy at select sites, such as HS2, but is dispensable at others, including the FOG-1-independent GATA-1 target gene EKLF. Remarkably, at the GATA-2 gene, which is repressed by GATA-1, interaction with FOG-1 was dispensable for GATA-1 occupancy and was required for transcriptional inhibition and histone deacetylation. These results indicate that FOG-1 employs distinct mechanisms when cooperating with GATA-1 during transcriptional activation and repression.",

One hallmark of the preovulatory follicle is the presence of luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptors (LHCGR) on granulosa cells (GCs). However, the mechanisms by which FSH induces Lhcgr gene expression are poorly understood. Our results show that protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways are required for FSH to activate both the murine Lhcgr-luciferase reporter and expression of Lhcgr mRNA in rat GCs. Based on results showing that an adenovirus (Ad) expressing a steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) mutant that cannot bind \u03b2-catenin abolished FSH-induced Lhcgr mRNA, we evaluated the role of \u03b2-catenin in the regulation of Lhcgr gene expression. FSH promoted the PKA-dependent, PI3K-independent phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin on Ser552 and Ser665. FSH activated the \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) artificial promoter-reporter TOPFlash via a PKA-dependent, PI3K-independent pathway, and dominant-negative (DN) TCF abolished FSH-activated Lhcgr-luciferase reporter and induction of Lhcgr mRNA. Microarray analysis of GCs treated with Ad-DN-TCF and FSH identified the Lhcgr as the most down-regulated gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results placed \u03b2-catenin phosphorylated on Ser552 and Ser675 and SF1 on the Lhcgr promoter in FSH-treated GCs; TCF3 was constitutively associated with the Lhcgr promoter. Transduction with an Ad-phospho-\u03b2-catenin mutant (Ser552/665/Asp) enhanced Lhcgr mRNA expression in FSH-treated cells greater than 3-fold. Finally, we identified a recognized PI3K/AKT target, forkhead box O1, as a negative regulator of Lhcgr mRNA expression. These results provide new understanding of the complex regulation of Lhcgr gene expression in GCs.",

In this study, we overexpressed a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 with a classic cysteine 459-to-serine mutation (dnSHP-2) to elucidate the in vivo effects of SHP-2 on T cells. We found that mice overexpressing dnSHP-2 showed reduced T cell activation, presumably due to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb2-binding protein (Gab2) and inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. SHP-2 appears to be a positive regulator of the MAPK pathway in T cells, likely through coupling of the multimeric complex to the Ras/MAPK pathway.

The current study investigated regions of RAMP1 important for CGRP or CLR interactions by alanine mutagenesis. Modeling suggested the second and third helices were important in protein-protein interactions. Most of the conserved residues in the N-terminus (M48, W56, Y66, P85, N66, H97, F101, D113, P114, P115), together with a further 13 residues spread throughout three helices of RAMP1, were mutated to alanine and coexpressed with CLR in Cos 7 cells. None of the mutations significantly reduced RAMP expression. Of the nine mutants from helix 1, only M48A had any effect, producing a modest reduction in trafficking of CLR to the cell surface. In helix 2 Y66A almost completely abolished CLR trafficking; L69A and T73A reduced the potency of CGRP to produce cAMP. In helix 3, H97A abolished CLR trafficking; P85A, N86A, and F101A had caused modest reductions in CLR trafficking and also reduced the potency of CGRP on cAMP production. F93A caused a modest reduction in CLR trafficking alone and L94A increased cAMP production. The data are consistent with a CLR recognition site particularly involving Y66 and H97, with lesser roles for adjacent residues in helix 3. L69 and T73 may contribute to a CGRP recognition site in helix 2 also involving nearby residues.",

Gly-348, the reported site of a beta turn, was replaced with other neutral amino acids without severely affecting rhodopsin binding. However, proline substitution abolished rhodopsin interaction, suggesting that flexibility is important at this site. A comparison between C347Y, which lost both rhodopsin and guanine nucleotide binding, and a mutant substituted with alpha q sequence (D346E/C347Y/G348N/F350V), in which guanine nucleotide binding was restored, implies that distinct motifs maintain the structure of the alpha subunit and are necessary for selective interaction with receptors. Surprisingly, mutants L344A, L349A, F350stop, and stop351A demonstrated a parallel loss of rhodopsin and guanine nucleotide binding. Altered profiles of L344A and F350stop on sucrose density gradients indicate that these mutants may undergo denaturation. The equivalent of alpha tL344A generated in alpha s and alpha i did not show such a severe loss of guanine nucleotide binding, revealing that the alpha t carboxyl terminus is unique in its susceptibility to changes in amino acid sequence.",

Most such determinants have been localized to the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain, but other domains in the subunit proteins can play roles in modulating receptor surface expression. Here we demonstrate that formation of an intact glutamate binding site also acts as an additional quality-control check for surface expression of homomeric and heteromeric kainate receptors. A key ligand-binding residue in the KA2 subunit, threonine 675, was mutated to either alanine or glutamate, which eliminated affinity for the receptor ligands kainate and glutamate. We found that plasma membrane expression of heteromeric GluR6/KA2(T675A) or GluR6/KA2(T675E) kainate receptors was markedly reduced compared with wild-type GluR6/KA2 receptors in transfected HEK 293 and COS-7 cells and in cultured neurons. Surface expression of homomeric KA2 receptors lacking a retention/retrieval determinant (KA2-R/A) was also reduced upon mutation of Thr-675 and elimination of the ligand binding site. KA2 Thr-675 mutant subunits were able to co-assemble with GluR5 and GluR6 subunits and were degraded at the same rate as wild-type KA2 subunit protein. These results suggest that glutamate binding and associated conformational changes are prerequisites for forward trafficking of intracellular kainate receptors following multimeric assembly.",

Like most members of the ABCC subfamily, Ycf1p contains an N-terminal extension in addition to its ABC \"core\" domain and transports substrates in the form of glutathione conjugates. Ycf1p is subject to complex regulation to ensure its optimal function. Previous studies showed that Ycf1p activity is stimulated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Tus1p, and is positively regulated by phosphorylation in its ABC core domain at residues Ser-908 and Thr-911. Here we provide evidence that phosphorylation of Ser-251 in the Ycf1p N-terminal extension negatively regulates activity. Mutant Ycf1p-S251A exhibits increased resistance to cadmium in vivo and increased Ycf1p-dependent transport of [(3)H]estradiol-beta-17-glucuronide in vitro as compared with wild-type Ycf1p. Activity is restored to the wild-type level for Ycf1-S251E. To identify kinase(s) that negatively regulate Ycf1p function, we conducted an integrated membrane yeast two-hybrid (iMYTH) screen and identified two kinase genes, CKA1 and HAL5, deletion of which increases Ycf1p function. Genetic evidence suggests that Cka1p may regulate Ycf1p function through phosphorylation of Ser-251 either directly or indirectly. Overall, this study provides compelling evidence that negative, as well as positive, regulation of Ycf1p is mediated by phosphorylation.",

Insulin proceeds via the canonical association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). The signaling involved in leucine effect, although known to implicate a PI3K mechanism independent of PKB/Akt, is more poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether PDK1 could also participate in the events leading to mTOR/p70(S6K) activation in response to leucine in the heart. In wild-type hearts, both leucine and insulin increased p70(S6K) activity whereas, in contrast to insulin, leucine was unable to activate PKB/Akt. The changes in p70(S6K) activity induced by insulin and leucine correlated with changes in phosphorylation of Thr(389), the mTOR phosphorylation site on p70(S6K), and of Ser(2448) on mTOR, both related to mTOR activity. Leucine also triggered phosphorylation of the proline-rich Akt/PKB substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40), a new pivotal mTOR regulator. In PDK1 knockout hearts, leucine, similarly to insulin, failed to induce the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70(S6K), leading to the absence of p70(S6K) activation. The loss of leucine effect in absence of PDK1 correlated with the lack of PRAS40 phosphorylation. Moreover, the introduction in PDK1 of the L155E mutation, which is known to preserve the insulin-induced and PKB/Akt-dependent phosphorylation of mTOR/p70(S6K), suppressed all leucine effects, including phosphorylation of mTOR, PRAS40, and p70(S6K).

Our aim was to characterize the role of early lytic proteins and viral lytic DNA replication in activation of DNA damage signaling during the EBV lytic cycle. Our data challenge the prevalent hypothesis that activation of DDR pathways during the EBV lytic cycle occurs solely in response to large amounts of exogenous double stranded DNA products generated during lytic viral DNA replication. In immunofluorescence or immunoblot assays, DDR activation markers, specifically phosphorylated ATM (pATM), H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), or 53BP1 (p53BP1), were induced in the presence or absence of viral DNA amplification or replication compartments during the EBV lytic cycle. In assays with an ATM inhibitor and DNA damaging reagents in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, \u03b3H2AX induction was necessary for optimal expression of early EBV genes, but not sufficient for lytic reactivation. Studies in lytically reactivated EBV-positive cells in which early EBV proteins, BGLF4, BGLF5, or BALF2, were not expressed showed that these proteins were not necessary for DDR activation during the EBV lytic cycle. Expression of ZEBRA, a viral protein that is necessary for EBV entry into the lytic phase, induced pATM foci and \u03b3H2AX independent of other EBV gene products. ZEBRA mutants deficient in DNA binding, Z(R183E) and Z(S186E), did not induce foci of pATM. ZEBRA co-localized with HP1\u03b2, a heterochromatin associated protein involved in DNA damage signaling. We propose a model of DDR activation during the EBV lytic cycle in which ZEBRA induces ATM kinase phosphorylation, in a DNA binding dependent manner, to modulate gene expression. ATM and H2AX phosphorylation induced prior to EBV replication may be critical for creating a microenvironment of viral and cellular gene expression that enables lytic cycle progression.",

In contrast, phosphorylation of Erk1/2, GSK-3, and PKB in response to glucose and IGF-1 was more prolonged (>24 h) and, though not as robust as TGF-alpha/EGF, did increase beta-cell proliferation. Phosphorylation of p70(S6K) was also increased by IGF-1/glucose, but not by TGF-alpha/EGF, despite upstream PKB activation. It was found that IGF-1 induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) association with insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and -2 in a glucose-dependent manner, whereas TGF-alpha/EGF did not. The importance of specific IRS-2-mediated signaling events was emphasized in that adenoviral-mediated overexpression of IRS-2 further increased glucose/IGF-1-induced beta-cell proliferation (more than twofold; P < 0.05) compared with control or adenoviral-mediated IRS-1 overexpressing INS-1 cells. Neither IRS-1 nor IRS-2 overexpression induced a beta-cell proliferative response to TGF-alpha/EGF. Thus, a prolonged activation of Erk1/2 and PI3K signaling pathways is important in committing a beta-cell to a mitogenic event, and it is likely that this sustained activation is instigated by signal transduction occurring specifically through IRS-2.",

At the cellular level, we observed alterations in the amounts for several components of the NE in patient fibroblasts and further phenotypic characteristics generally attributed to laminopathies such as increased sensitivity to heat stress. The defects were more severe than observed in EDMD cells with mutations in a single gene. In particular, in patient fibroblasts carrying the p.A203V mutation in SUN1, the alterations were aggravated.

Choline acetyltransferase is a substrate for several protein kinases. In the present study, we demonstrate that short term exposure of IMR32 neuroblastoma cells expressing human choline acetyltransferase to A beta-(1-42) changes phosphorylation of the enzyme, resulting in increased activity and alterations in its interaction with other cellular proteins. Using mass spectrometry, we identified threonine 456 as a new phosphorylation site in choline acetyltransferase from A beta-(1-42)-treated cells and in purified recombinant ChAT phosphorylated in vitro by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). Whereas phosphorylation of choline acetyltransferase by protein kinase C alone caused a 2-fold increase in enzyme activity, phosphorylation by CaM kinase II alone did not alter enzyme activity. A 3-fold increase in choline acetyltransferase activity was found with coordinate phosphorylation of threonine 456 by CaM kinase II and phosphorylation of serine 440 by protein kinase C. This phosphorylation combination was observed in choline acetyltransferase from A beta-(1-42)-treated cells. Treatment of cells with A beta-(1-42) resulted in two phases of activation of choline acetyltransferase, the first within 30 min and associated with phosphorylation by protein kinase C and the second by 10 h and associated with phosphorylation by both CaM kinase II and protein kinase C. We also show that choline acetyltransferase from A beta-(1-42)-treated cells co-immunoprecipitates with valosin-containing protein, and mutation of threonine 456 to alanine abolished the A beta-(1-42)-induced effects. These studies demonstrate that A beta-(1-42) can acutely regulate the function of choline acetyltransferase, thus potentially altering cholinergic neurotransmission.",

Our previous studies demonstrated requirement of Rsf-1 for cell survival in cancer cells, which contributed to tumour progression; however, its role in tumourigenesis has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we co-immunoprecipitated proteins with Rsf-1 followed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and identified cyclin E1, besides SNF2H, as one of the major Rsf-1 interacting proteins. Like RSF1, CCNE1 is frequently amplified in ovarian cancer, and both Rsf-1 and cyclin E1 were found co-up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues. Ectopic expression of Rsf-1 and cyclin E1 in non-tumourigenic TP53(mut) RK3E cells led to an increase in cellular proliferation and tumour formation by activating cyclin E1-associated kinase (CDK2). Tumourigenesis was not detected if either cyclin E1 or Rsf-1 was expressed, or they were expressed in a TP53(wt) background. Domain mapping showed that cyclin E1 interacted with the first 441 amino acids of Rsf-1. Ectopic expression of this truncated domain significantly suppressed G1/S-phase transition, cellular proliferation, and tumour formation of RK3E-p53(R175H) /Rsf-1/cyclin E1 cells. The above findings suggest that Rsf-1 interacts and collaborates with cyclin E1 in neoplastic transformation and TP53 mutations are a prerequisite for tumour-promoting functions of the RSF/cyclin E1 complex.",

However, dimerization of the RTK Neu (also designated ErbB-2, HER-2, and p185(neu)), while necessary, is not sufficient for signaling. Earlier work in our laboratory had shown that introduction of an ectopic cysteine into the Neu juxtamembrane domain induces Neu dimerization but not signaling. Since Neu signaling does require dimerization, we hypothesized that there are additional constraints that govern signaling ability. With the importance of the interreceptor cross-phosphorylation reaction, a likely constraint was the relative geometry of receptors within the dimer. We have tested this possibility by constructing a consecutive series of cysteine substitutions in the Neu juxtamembrane domain in order to force dimerization along a series of interreceptor faces. Within the group that dimerized constitutively, a subset had transforming activity. The substitutions in this subset all mapped to the same face of a predicted alpha helix, the most likely conformation for the intramembrane domain. Furthermore, this face of interaction aligns with the projected Neu* V664E substitution and with a predicted amphipathic interface in the Neu juxtamembrane domain. We propose that these results identify an RTK dimer interface and that dimerization of this RTK induces an extended contact between juxtamembrane and intramembrane alpha helices.",

Here we report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase with AG-1478 markedly delays breast tumor formation in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)/Neu + MMTV/transforming growth factor alpha bigenic mice. This delay was associated with inhibition of EGFR and Neu signaling, reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities and cyclin D1, and an increase in the levels of the Cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1). In addition, BrdUrd incorporation into tumor cell nuclei was prevented with no signs of tumor cell apoptosis. These observations prompted us to investigate the stability of p27. Recombinant p27 was degraded rapidly in vitro by untreated but not by AG-1478-treated tumor lysates. Proteasome depletion of the tumor lysates, addition of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U-0126, or a T187A mutation in recombinant p27 all prevented p27 degradation. Cdk2 and MAPK precipitates from untreated tumor lysates phosphorylated recombinant wild-type p27 but not the T187A mutant in vitro. Cdk2 and MAPK precipitates from AG-1478-treated tumors were unable to phosphorylate p27 in vitro. These data suggest that increased signaling by ErbB receptors up-regulates MAPK activity, which, in turn, phosphorylates and destabilizes p27, thus contributing to dysregulated cell cycle progression.",

To determine how MITF activity is regulated, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins expressed by human melanoma cells that interact with MITF. The majority of clones that showed positive interaction with a 158-amino-acid region of MITF containing the bHLH/ZIP domain (aa 168-325) encoded the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme hUBC9. The association of MITF with hUBC9 was further confirmed by an in vitro GST pull-down assay. Although hUBC9 is known to interact preferentially with SENTRIN/SUMO1, in vitro transcription/translation analysis demonstrated greater association of MITF with ubiquitin than with SENTRIN. Importantly, cotransfection of MITF and hUBC9 expression vectors resulted in MITF protein degradation. MITF protein was stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in MITF degradation. Serine 73, which is located in a region rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST), regulates MITF protein stability, since a serine to alanine mutation prevented hUBC9-mediated MITF (S73A) degradation. Furthermore, we identified lysine 201 as a potential ubiquitination site. A lysine to arginine mutation abolished MITF (K201R) degradation by hUBC9 in vivo. Our experiments indicate that by targeting MITF for proteasome degradation, hUBC9 is a critical regulator of melanocyte differentiation.",

NR1-2a(c-Myc) was, however, shown to assemble with NR2A subunits by immunoprecipitation and [(3)H]MK801 radioligand binding assays. Immunoblots of cells co-transfected with wild-type NR1-2a/NR2A subunits yielded two NR1-2a immunoreactive species with molecular masses of 115 and 226 kDa. Two-dimensional electrophoresis under non-reducing and reducing conditions revealed that the 226-kDa band contained disulfide-linked NR1-2a subunits. Only the 115-kDa NR1-2a species was detected for NR1-2a(c-Myc)/NR2A. The c-Myc epitope is inserted adjacent to cysteine 79 of the NR1-2a subunit; therefore, it is possible that the tag may prevent the formation of NR1 disulfide bridges. A series of cysteine --> alanine NR1-2a mutants was generated, and the NR1-2a mutants were co-expressed with NR2A or NR2B subunits in mammalian cells and characterized with respect to cell surface expression, cell cytotoxicity post-transfection, co-association by immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. When co-expressed with NR2A in mammalian cells, NR1-2a(C79A)/NR2A displayed similar properties to NR1-2a(c-Myc)/NR2A in that the 226-kDa NR1 immunoreactive species was not detectable, and trafficking to the cell surface was impaired compared with wild-type NR1/NR2 receptors. These results provide the first biochemical evidence for the formation of NR1-NR1 intersubunit disulfide-linked homodimers involving cysteine 79.

Although both the phospho (CK2-PVn) and non-phospho (Vn) analogs of vitronectin (simulated by mutants Vn(T50E,T57E), and Vn(T50A,T57A), respectively) trigger the alpha(v)beta3 as well as the alpha(v)beta5 integrins, and equally activate the ERK pathway, these two forms are different in their activation of the focal adhesion kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway. Specifically, we show (i) that, upon exposure of cells to Vn/CK2-PVn, their PKB activation depends on the availability of the alpha(v)beta3 integrin on their surface; (ii) that upon adhesion of the beta3-transfected cells onto the CK2-PVn, the extent of PKB activation coincides with the enhanced adhesion of these cells, and (iii) that both the PKB activation and the elevation in the adhesion of these cells is PI3K-dependent. The occurrence of a cell surface receptor that specifically distinguishes between a phosphorylated and a non-phosphorylated analog of Vn, together with the fact that it preferentially activates a distinct intra-cellular signaling pathway, suggest that extra-cellular CK2 phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration.",

Furthermore, full-length Shc in which Tyr239/Tyr240 had been mutated to phenylalanine did not become tyrosine-phosphorylated or bind Grb2 but did inhibit colony formation in soft agar.

CBF\u03b2 is essential for Vif to counteract APOBEC3 by enabling the recruitment of cullin 5 to the complex and increasing the steady-state level of Vif protein; however, the mechanisms by which CBF\u03b2 up-regulates Vif protein remains unclear. Because we have reported previously that mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is an E3 ligase for Vif, we hypothesized that CBF\u03b2 might protect Vif from MDM2-mediated degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Vif mutants that do not bind to CBF\u03b2 preferentially interact with MDM2 and that overexpression of CBF\u03b2 disrupts the interaction between MDM2 and Vif. Knockdown of CBF\u03b2 reduced the steady-state level of Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells. Cycloheximide chase analyses revealed that Vif E88A/W89A, which does not interact with CBF\u03b2, degraded faster than wild-type Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells, suggesting that Vif stabilization by CBF\u03b2 is mainly caused by impairing MDM2-mediated degradation. We identified Vif R93E as a Vif variant that does not bind to MDM2, and the virus with this substitution mutation was more resistant to APOBEC3G than the parental virus. Combinatory substitution of Vif residues required for CBF\u03b2 binding and MDM2 binding showed full recovery of Vif steady-state levels, supporting our hypothesis. Our data provide new insights into the mechanism of Vif augmentation by CBF\u03b2.",

In this study we have used several approaches to investigate the GPIb alpha-thrombin interaction in more detail and to study its effect on the thrombin-induced elaboration of fibrin. We found that both glycocalicin and the amino-terminal fragment of GPIb alpha reduced the release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen by about 50% by a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism. Similarly, GPIb alpha caused in thrombin an allosteric reduction in the rate of turnover of the small peptide substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The K(d) for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction was 1 microm at physiological ionic strength but was highly salt-dependent, decreasing to 0.19 microm at 100 mm NaCl (Gamma(salt) = -4.2). The salt dependence was characteristic of other thrombin ligands that bind to exosite II of this enzyme, and we confirmed this as the GPIb alpha-binding site on thrombin by using thrombin mutants and by competition binding studies. R68E or R70E mutations in exosite I of thrombin had little effect on its interaction with GPIb alpha. Both the allosteric inhibition of fibrinogen turnover caused by GPIb alpha binding to these mutants, and the K(d) values for their interactions with GPIb alpha were similar to those of wild-type thrombin. In contrast, R89E and K248E mutations in exosite II of thrombin markedly increased the K(d) values for the interactions of these thrombin mutants with GPIb alpha by 10- and 25-fold, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (which binds to thrombin exosite II) but not hirugen (residues 54-65 of hirudin, which binds to exosite I of thrombin) inhibited thrombin binding to GPIb alpha. These data demonstrate that GPIb alpha binds to thrombin exosite II and in so doing causes a conformational change in the active site of thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that alters the accessibility of both its natural substrate, fibrinogen, and the small peptidyl substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA.",

Chem. 275, 12251-12260], including pathways that target GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) for inactivation and those that result in activation of GEFs (guanine nucleotide-exchange factors) Sos (son of sevenless homologue) or RasGRP (RAS guanyl releasing protein). However, a biochemical link between PE and GAP inactivation is missing and GEF stimulation is hard to reconcile with the observation that dominant-negative S17N-Ras does not compromise Ras-dependent ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) activation by PE. We have addressed this controversy and carried out an in-depth biochemical study of PE-induced Ras activation in COS-7 cells. Using a cell-permeabilization approach to monitor nucleotide exchange on Ras, we demonstrate that PE-induced Ras-GTP accumulation results from GEF stimulation. Nucleotide exchange stimulation by PE is prevented by PKC (protein kinase C) inhibition but not by EGFR [EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor] blockade, despite the fact that EGFR inhibition aborts basal and PE-induced Shc (Src homology and collagen homology) phosphorylation and Shc-Grb2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2) association. In fact, EGFR inhibition ablates basal nucleotide exchange on Ras in growth-arrested COS-7 cells. These data disclose the existence of two separate GEF systems that operate independently from each other to accomplish PE-dependent formation of Ras-GTP and to maintain resting Ras-GTP levels respectively. We document that COS-7 cells do not express RasGRP and present evidence that the PE-responsive GEF system may involve PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Sos. More fundamentally, these observations shed new light on enigmatic issues such as the inefficacy of S17N-Ras in blocking PE action or the role of the EGFR in heterologous agonist activation of the Ras/ERK pathway.",

It is a Holliday-structure resolvase (X-solvase) responsible for clearing branched replicative DNA prior to packaging. Consequently, mutations in gene 49 are unable to fill heads to completion because unresolved branches stop translocation of DNA. A likely association of gp49 with heads or proheads, however, could not be shown in the past. We have investigated whether gp49 could be part of the transiently assembled packaging machine (the \"packasome\") located at the base of proheads. Using purified proteins gpl6, gpl7 and gp20, which are constituents of the packasome, we found that gp49 binds tightly to gp20 and does not bind to gpl6 or gpl7. Quantification revealed that one dimer of gp49 binds one monomer of gp20. Notably, dimerisation of gp49 was an essential prerequisite for complex formation with gp20, and the dimerisation-deficient point mutation His-EVII-W87R showed only residual affinity to gp20. Furthermore, truncated peptides of gp49 deficient in dimer formation to various degrees were found to be impaired in binding to gp20. In contrast, the cleavage-deficient mutation EVII-N62D bound normally to gp20. The cruciform DNA (cf-DNA) resolving activity typical of endo VII is maintained in gp20-gp49 complexes. Furthermore, the complexes bind cf-DNA in the absence of Mg2+ as demonstrated by electromobility shift assays. The binding of the complexes to cf-DNA occurs via gp49, since gp20 alone does not bind cf-DNA. In conclusion, these findings are consistent with a model in which gp49 is an integral part of the packaging machine of phage T4.",

Biosynthesis of the H2-oxidizing enzymes is a complex process subject to positive control by H2 and negative control by organic energy sources. In this report we describe a novel signal transduction system regulating hydrogenase gene (hox) expression in the proteobacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus. This multicomponent system consists of the proteins HoxB, HoxC, HoxJ*, and HoxA. HoxB and HoxC share characteristic features of dimeric [NiFe] hydrogenases and form the putative H2 receptor that interacts directly or indirectly with the histidine protein kinase HoxJ*. A single amino acid substitution (HoxJ*G422S) in a conserved C-terminal glycine-rich motif of HoxJ* resulted in a loss of H2-dependent signal transduction and a concomitant block in autophosphorylating activity, suggesting that autokinase activity is essential for the response to H2. Whereas deletions in hoxB or hoxC abolished hydrogenase synthesis almost completely, the autokinase-deficient strain maintained high-level hox gene expression, indicating that the active sensor kinase exerts a negative effect on hox gene expression in the absence of H2. Substitutions of the conserved phosphoryl acceptor residue Asp55 in the response regulator HoxA (HoxAD55E and HoxAD55N) disrupted the H2 signal-transduction chain. Unlike other NtrC-like regulators, the altered HoxA proteins still allowed high-level transcriptional activation.

We reported previously that a recombinant fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the N-terminal domain of G(M) [GST-G(M)-(1-240)] bound PP1 in a pull down assay, and phosphorylation by PKA prevented PP1 binding. Here we report that substitution of either Ala or Val for Ser-67 in the RVS(67)F motif in GST-G(M)-(1-240) essentially eliminated PP1 binding. This was unexpected because other glycogen-targeting subunits have a Val residue at the position corresponding to Ser-67. In contrast, a mutation of Ser-67 to Thr (S67T) in GST-G(M)(1-240) gave a protein that bound PP1 the same as wild type and was unaffected by PKA phosphorylation. Full length G(M) tagged with the epitope sequence DYKDDDDK (FLAG) expressed in COS7 cells bound PP1 that was recovered by co-immunoprecipitation, but this association was prevented by treatment of the cells with forskolin. By comparison, PP1 binding with FLAG-G(M)(S67T) was not disrupted by forskolin treatment. Neither FLAG-G(M)(S67A) nor FLAG-G(M)(S67V) formed stable complexes with PP1 in COS7 cells.

Recent studies have demonstrated that some tumor-derived mutations of Smad4 are associated with protein instability; however, the precise mechanism by which mutated Smad4 proteins undergo rapid degradation remains to be elucidated. A missense mutation of the SMAD4 gene in the Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain (c.305C>T, Pro102Leu) and one frameshift mutation resulting in termination in the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain (c.1447_1448insAATA, Delta483-552) have been identified in acute myelogenous leukemia. It is not known whether protein instability of these SMAD4 mutants is one of the contributors to TGF-beta signaling disruption in acute myelogenous leukemia. Here we report that these two acute myelogenous leukemia-derived SMAD4 mutants are degraded rapidly when compared to their wild-type counterpart. We have demonstrated that both mutated proteins exhibit enhanced polyubiquitination (or polyubiquitylation) and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, we found that beta-transducin-repeat-containing protein 1 (beta-TrCP1), an F-box protein in the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complex, directly interacts with and acts as a critical determinant for degradation of both mutated SMAD4 proteins. In addition, small interference RNA (siRNA)-triggered endogenous beta-TrCP1 suppression increased the protein expression level of both overexpressed SMAD4 mutants and endogenous mutated SMAD4 protein in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. These data suggest that mutated SMAD4 proteins undergo rapid degradation in acute myelogenous leukemia cells via SCF(beta-TrCP1) E3 ligase-mediated protein ubiquitination (or ubiquitylation) and subsequent proteasomal degradation.",

An equivalent shift was detected in cells overexpressing HAL3, a inhibitory regulatory subunit of Ppz1. Subsequent analysis identified the conserved Ser-86 as the in vivo phosphorylatable residue and showed that its phosphorylation was increased in ppz cells. Pull-down experiments using a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EF1Balpha fusion version allowed to identify Ppz1 as an in vivo interacting protein. Cells lacking Ppz display a higher tolerance to known translation inhibitors, such as hygromycin and paromomycin, and enhanced readthrough at all three nonsense codons, suggesting that translational fidelity might be affected. Overexpression of a GST-EF1Balpha fusion counteracted the growth defect associated to high levels of Ppz1 and this effect was essentially lost when the phosphorylatable Ser-86 is replaced by Ala.

S312A did not colocalize with either rab4a or rab11, instead they exited from early endosomes to late endosomes/lysosomes in which they were degraded. Rab11a played a prominent role in recycling of the WT \u00df1-AR because dominant negative rab11a inhibited, while constitutively active rab11a accelerated the recycling of the \u00df1-AR. Next, we determined the effect of each of the rab11-interacting proteins on trafficking of the WT \u00df1-AR. The recycling of the \u00df1-AR was markedly inhibited when myosin Vb, FIP2, FIP3 and rabphillin were knocked down. These data indicate that rab11a and a select group of its binding partners play a prominent role in recycling of the human \u00df1-AR.",

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the presenilin (PSEN) genes are responsible for the majority of early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) cases. PSEN1 is a component of a high molecular weight, endoplasmic reticulum, membrane-bound protein complex, including beta-catenin. Pathogenic PSEN1 mutations were demonstrated to have an effect on beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta(GSK-3beta), two members of the wingless Wnt pathway. The nuclear translocation and the stability of beta-catenin, and the interaction between GSK3beta and PSEN1 were influenced. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells overexpressing wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) PSEN1, treated with and without LiCl, were used to isolate cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. By Western blot analysis, endogenous beta-catenin levels were examined. By analyzing cytosolic fractions of PSEN1, transfected and nontransfected HEK 293 cells, and total brain extracts of AD patients and controls, we evaluated the effect of PSEN1 overexpression on beta-catenin stability. Finally, we analyzed the effect of pathogenic PSEN1 mutations on the interaction between PSEN1 and GSK3beta by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. RESULTS: We report reduced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin in cells stably expressing I143T, G384A, and T113-114ins PSEN1. The G384A PSEN1 mutation showed a similar pronounced effect on nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, as reported for processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid beta(Abeta). Overexpression of PSEN1 and the presence of pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 had no significant effect on the stability of beta-catenin. Nonspecific binding of overexpressed PSEN1 to endogenous GSK3beta was observed when GSK3beta was immunoprecipitated. Immunoprecipitation of PSEN1 in cells overexpressing PSEN1 and in native cells, however, did not result in co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous GSK3beta. CONCLUSION: Our results further establish the nuclear translocation assay of beta-catenin as an adequate alternative for traditional Abeta measurement to evaluate the effect of PSEN1 mutations on biochemical processes. We detected no significant effect of overexpressed wt or mt PSEN1 on the stability of beta-catenin. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation between PSEN1 and GSK3beta was not observed in our experimental setup.",

Recently, CaMKII was found to phosphorylate the Na(+) channel 1.5 (Na(v)1.5), resulting in enhanced I(NaL). Conversely, an increase of I(NaL) would be expected to cause elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and activation of CaMKII. However, a relationship between enhancement of I(NaL) and activation of CaMKII has yet to be demonstrated. We investigated whether Na(+) influx via Na(v)1.5 leads to CaMKII activation and explored the functional significance of this pathway. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM), treatment with the I(NaL) activators anemone toxin II (ATX-II) or veratridine increased CaMKII autophosphorylation and increased phosphorylation of CaMKII substrates phospholamban and ryanodine receptor 2. Knockdown of Na(v)1.5 (but not Na(v)1.1 or Na(v)1.2) prevented ATX-II-induced CaMKII phosphorylation, providing evidence for a specific role of Na(v)1.5 in CaMKII activation. In support of this view, CaMKII activity was also increased in hearts of transgenic mice overexpressing a gain-of-function Na(v)1.5 mutant (N(1325)S). The effects of both ATX-II and the N(1325)S mutation were reversed by either I(NaL) inhibition (with ranolazine or tetrodotoxin) or CaMKII inhibition (with KN93 or autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide). Furthermore, ATX-II treatment also induced CaMKII-Na(v)1.5 coimmunoprecipitation. The same association between CaMKII and Na(v)1.5 was also found in N(1325)S mice, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction. Pharmacological inhibitions of either CaMKII or I(NaL) also prevented ATX-II-induced cell death in NRVM and reduced the incidence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia induced by ATX-II in rat perfused hearts. Taken together, these results suggest that a Na(v)1.5-dependent increase in Na(+) influx leads to activation of CaMKII, which in turn phosphorylates Na(v)1.5, further promoting Na(+) influx. Pharmacological inhibition of either CaMKII or Na(v)1.5 can ameliorate cardiac dysfunction caused by excessive Na(+) influx.",

Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Raf-Arg59 and Raf-Arg67 from RafRBD are interacting residues complementary to Ras-Glu37 located in the Ras effector region. Raf-Arg59 and Raf-Arg67 also mediate interaction with Ras-Glu37 in Ras-dependent Raf activation. The characteristics observed here can be used as criteria for a role of residues from other regions of Raf in Ras-Raf interaction and activation. We developed a quantitative two-hybrid system as a tool to investigate the effect of point mutations on protein-protein interactions that elude biochemical analysis of bacterially expressed proteins. This assay shows that Raf-Ser257 in the RafCR2 domain does not contribute to Ras-Raf interaction and that the Raf-S257L mutation does not restore Raf binding to Ras-E37G. Yet, Raf-S257L displays high constitutive kinase activity and further activation by Ras-G12V/E37G is still impaired as compared with activation by Ras-G12V. This strongly suggests that the RafCR2 domain is an independent domain involved in the control of Raf activity and a common mechanism for constitutively activating mutants may be the interference with the inactive ground state of the kinase.",

Tax is localized to the DNA through its interaction with the site-specific activators cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein, NF-kappaB, and serum response factor. It has been suggested that the recruitment of Tax to the DNA positions Tax for interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery. On the basis of several independent assays, we now report a physical and functional interaction between Tax and the transcription factor, TFIIA. First, Tax was found to interact with the 35-kDa (alpha) subunit of TFIIA in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system. Importantly, two previously characterized mutants with point mutations in Tax, M32 (Y196A, K197S) and M41 (H287A, P288S), which were shown to be defective in Tax-activated transcription were unable to interact with TFIIA in this assay. Second, a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) affinity-binding assay showed that the interaction of holo-TFIIA with GST-Tax was 20-fold higher than that observed with either the GST-Tax M32 activation mutant or the GST control. Third, a coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that in HTLV-1-infected human T lymphocytes, Tax and TFIIA were associated. Finally, TFIIA facilitates Tax transactivation in vitro and in vivo. In vitro transcription studies showed reduced levels of Tax-activated transcription in cell extracts depleted of TFIIA. In addition, transfection of human T lymphocytes with TFIIA expression vectors enhanced Tax-activated transcription of an HTLV-1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct. Our study suggests that the interaction of Tax with the transcription factor TFIIA may play a role in Tax-mediated transcriptional activation.",

In an effort to assign these subfunctions to the primary sequence of the protein, a series of spontaneous point mutations deficient in DNA cleavage was isolated. Some of these mutations affected the dimerization of Endo VII. Compared with wild-type protein, which dimerizes completely in solution, more than 95% of one of the mutant proteins (W87R) remained in the monomeric state. Only the dimeric fraction of this protein bound to DNA. The dimerization domain of Endo VII was mapped by truncating the gene from both ends and analysing the dimerization ability of the purified peptides by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. The dimerization domain was thus determined to reside between amino acid residues 55 and 105. Computer analyses predicted two alpha-helices (H2 and H3) in this section of the protein. As demonstrated by heterodimer formation, two copies of helix H3, but only one copy of helix H2, are required for dimerization. Helical wheel analyses revealed that both helices expose a hydrophobic face along their axes, suggesting that hydrophobic interaction between helices H3 mediate formation of Endo VII dimers, while helices H2 stabilize them.",

We report that a thigmotropic cue is necessary for initiating appressoria and for accumulating cAMP. Similar to an RGS1-deletion strain, magA(G187S) (RGS-insensitive Galpha(s)) and magA(Q208L) (GTPase-dead) mutants accumulated excessive cAMP and elaborated appressoria on non-inductive surfaces, suggesting that Rgs1 regulates MagA during pathogenesis.

We also assayed glycogen synthase activation in cells expressing wild type G(M) and G(M) mutated at the phosphorylation sites.

Phosphorylation of both sites was dependent on activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, involving in particular ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Full-length G(M) was expressed in CHO-IR cells and metabolic (32)P labeling at sites 1 and 2 was increased by insulin treatment. The G(M) expressed in CHO-IR cells or in C2C12 myotubes co-immunoprecipitated endogenous PP-1, and association was transiently lost following treatment of the cells with insulin. In contrast PP-1 binding to G(M)(S67T), a version of G(M) not phosphorylated at site 2, was unaffected by insulin treatment.

Insulin stimulated glycogen synthase activity the same extent in cells expressing wild type G(M) or G(M) mutated to eliminate phosphorylation site 1 and/or site 2.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the interaction site of rat PLD(1) (rPLD(1)) with RhoA. Selection with phage display of different peptides of rPLD(1) confirmed that GTP-bound RhoA interacted with a site in the amino acid sequence 873-1024 at the C-terminus of rPLD(1). RhoA also associated with this peptide in a GTP-dependent manner in COS-7 cell lysates and the peptide inhibited RhoA stimulation of PLD activity in membranes from COS-7 cells expressing rPLD(1). A series of alanine mutations of non-conserved residues were made in this sequence, and the enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells and checked for responses to activation of PKC, which interacts with the N-terminus of PLD(1), and also to the constitutively active V14RhoA. Mutations in the C-terminus of rPLD(1) (K946A, V950A, R955A and K962A) caused partial loss of V14RhoA stimulation, and double mutations (K946A/K962A, K946A/V950A and K962A/V950A) caused an almost total loss. Co-immunoprecipitation studies also showed that the mutated forms of rPLD(1) described above failed to bind V14RhoA compared with wild-type rPLD(1), whereas rPLD(1) with mutations outside the region K946-K962 bound V14RhoA normally. It is concluded that basic amino acids in a restricted C-terminal region of rPLD(1) are important for binding of RhoA and its activation of PLD activity.",

We found that mutp53 preferentially and autonomously binds to G/C-rich DNA around transcription start sites (TSS) of many genes characterized by active chromatin marks (H3K4me3) and frequently associated with transcription-competent RNA polymerase II. Mutp53-bound regions overlap predominantly with CpG islands and are enriched in G4-motifs that are prone to form G-quadruplex structures. In line, mutp53 binds and stabilizes a well-characterized G-quadruplex structure in vitro.

Under these conditions, cAMP treatment increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein (p125) and its association with a p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85 PI3K), which were suggested to mediate potentiation of DNA synthesis. This study was undertaken to identify p125 and to elucidate its roles in potentiation of DNA synthesis induced by IGF-I. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis revealed p125 to be a rat ortholog of human XB130, which we named PI3K-associated protein (PI3KAP). cAMP treatment elevated PI3KAP/XB130 mRNA and protein levels as well as tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with p85 PI3K leading to increased PI3K activities associated with PI3KAP/XB130, supporting the role of PI3KAP/XB130 in DNA synthesis potentiation. Importantly, PI3KAP/XB130 knockdown attenuated cAMP-dependent potentiation of IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis. Furthermore, c-Src was associated with PI3KAP/XB130 and was activated in response to cAMP. Addition of Src family kinase inhibitors, PP1 or PP2, during cAMP treatment abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3KAP/XB130 and its interaction with p85 PI3K. Finally, introduction of PI3KAP/XB130 into NIH3T3 fibroblasts lacking endogenous PI3KAP/XB130 enhanced IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis; however, a mutant Y72F incapable of binding to p85 PI3K did not show this response. Together, these data indicate that cAMP-dependent induction of PI3KAP/XB130, which is associated with PI3K, is required for enhancement of IGF mitogenic activities.",

In this study, potential interactions of BPAG2 with other proteins expressed in epidermal keratinocytes were explored by yeast two-hybrid system using the amino-terminal intracellular domain of BPAG2 as a bait. Several independent interacting clones encoding keratin 18 (K18) were identified when the keratinocyte cDNA library, cloned into the yeast two-hybrid activation domain vector, was screened. The peptide sequence responsible for the interaction of BPAG2 was restricted to amino acids 15-25, and substitution of a valine residue in the middle of this sequence by a proline (V23P) by site-directed mutagenesis abolished the interaction. Further examination of the K18 sequences by restricted cDNA constructs in yeast two-hybrid system identified a carboxyl-terminal segment corresponding to helix 2B domain as critical for BPAG2 binding. The interaction of BPAG2/K18 was confirmed by an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, which also confirmed that normal human keratinocytes express K18 in culture. The tissue specific expression of BPAG2 was first examined using a multi-tissue RNA blot. Human multiple tissue cDNA panels representing a variety of adult and fetal tissues as well as tumor cells were used as PCR-templates to study the expression patterns of both BPAG2 and K18. The results demonstrated significant level of expression of BPAG2, besides in epidermal keratinocytes, also in a variety of tissues with predominant epithelial component, such as mammary, salivary and thyroid glands, colon, prostate, testis, placenta, and adult and fetal thymus, as well as in colon, pancreatic and prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, and an ovarian carcinoma. As expected, K18 transcript is present in liver, pancreas, colon, placenta, and in fetal kidney. Collectively, the results suggest that BPAG2 has a relatively broad tissue distribution including specialized and simple epithelia, and that within the tissues such as colon and placenta, BPAG2 may have direct interactions with K18, a keratin characteristically expressed in a simple epithelia.",

There are three human RyR subtypes, and several debilitating diseases are linked to heritable mutations in RyR1 and RyR2 including malignant hypothermia, central core disease, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2). Despite the recent appreciation that many disease-associated mutations within the N-terminal RyRABC domains (i.e., residues 1-559) are located in the putative interfaces mediating tetrameric channel assembly, the precise structural and dynamical consequences of the mutations are not well understood. We used solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to examine the effect of ARVD2-associated (i.e., R176Q) and CPVT-associated [i.e., P164S, R169Q and delta exon 3 (\u03943)] mutations on the structure and dynamics of RyR2A. Our solution NMR data exposed a mobile \u03b1-helix, unique to type 2; further, this \u03b12 helix rescues the \u03b2-strand lost in RyR2A \u03943 but remains dynamic in the hot-spot loop (HS-loop) P164S, R169Q and R176Q mutant proteins. Docking of our X-ray crystal/NMR hybrid structure into the RyR1 cryo-electron microscopy map revealed that this RyR2A \u03b12 helix is in close proximity to dense \"columns\" projecting toward the channel pore. This is in contrast to the HS-loop mutations that cause structural changes largely localized to the intersubunit interface between adjacent ABC domains. Taken together, our data suggest that ARVD2 and CPVT mutations have at least two distinct structural consequences linked to channel dysfunction: perturbation of the HS-loop (i.e., domain A):domain B intersubunit interface and disruption of the communication between the N-terminal region and the channel domain.",

Rab4 and syntaxin 4 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes. The interaction between the two proteins was reduced by insulin treatment and increased by the addition of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS). An in vitro binding assay revealed that the bacterially expressed Rab4 was bound to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 4 (GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273)) but not to syntaxin 1A or vesicle-associated membrane protein-2. The interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4 seemed to be regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4, because 1) GTPgammaS treatment of the cells significantly increased, but guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPbetaS) treatment decreased the amount of Rab4 pulled down with GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273) from the cell lysates; 2) GTPgammaS loading on Rab4 caused a marked increase in the affinity of Rab4 to syntaxin 4 whereas GDPbetaS loading had little effect; and 3) a GTPase-deficient mutant of Rab4 (Rab4(Q67L)), but not a GTP-binding-defective mutant (Rab4(S22N)), was bound to GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273). Although insulin stimulated [gamma-(32)P]GTP binding to Rab4 in a time-dependent fashion, its effect on the Rab4 interaction with syntaxin 4 was apparently biphasic; an initial increase in Rab4 associated with syntaxin 4 was followed by a gradual dissociation of the GTPase from syntaxin 4. Finally, the binding of Rab4(Q67L) to GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273) was inhibited by munc-18c in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GTP-loaded Rab4 binds to syntaxin 4 in the open conformation. These results suggest that 1) Rab4 interacts with syntaxin 4 in a direct and specific manner, and 2) the interaction is regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4 as well as by the conformational status of syntaxin 4.",

KCNQ1 mutations that disrupt this complex cause type 1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1), one of the potentially lethal heritable arrhythmia syndromes. Here, we report identification of (i) regions on Yotiao critical to its binding to KCNQ1 and (ii) a single putative LQTS-causing mutation (S1570L) in AKAP9 (Yotiao) localized to the KCNQ1 binding domain in 1/50 (2%) subjects with a clinically robust phenotype for LQTS but absent in 1,320 reference alleles. The inherited S1570L mutation reduces the interaction between KCNQ1 and Yotiao, reduces the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of the channel, eliminates the functional response of the I(Ks) channel to cAMP, and prolongs the action potential in a computational model of the ventricular cardiocyte. These reconstituted cellular consequences of the inherited S1570L-Yotiao mutation are consistent with delayed repolarization of the ventricular action potential observed in the affected siblings. Thus, we have demonstrated a link between genetic perturbations in AKAP and human disease in general and AKAP9 and LQTS in particular.",

LIMP-2 was identified as a sorting receptor for beta-glucocerebrosidase (beta-GC), which is defective in Gaucher disease. To date, six AMRF-causing mutations have been described, including splice site, missense and nonsense mutations. All mutations investigated in this study lead to a retention of LIMP-2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but affect the binding to beta-GC differentially. From the three nonsense mutations, only the Q288X mutation was still able to bind to beta-GC as efficiently as compared with wild-type LIMP-2, whereas the W146SfsX16 and W178X mutations lost their beta-GC-binding capacity almost completely. The LIMP-2 segment 145-288, comprising the nonsense mutations, contains a highly conserved coiled-coil domain, which we suggest determines beta-GC binding. In fact, disruption of the helical arrangement and amphiphatic nature of the coiled-coil domain abolishes beta-GC binding, and a synthetic peptide comprising the coiled-coil domain of LIMP-2 displays pH-selective multimerization properties. In contrast to the reduced binding properties of the nonsense mutations, the only missense mutation (H363N) found in AMRF leads to increased binding of beta-GC to LIMP-2, indicating that this highly conserved histidine modifies the affinity of LIMP-2 to its ligand. With the present study, we demonstrate that disruption of the coiled-coil structure or AMRF disease-causing mutations abolish beta-GC binding, indicating the importance of an intact coiled-coil structure for the interaction of LIMP-2 and beta-GC.",

In this study, we tested whether H11K-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is mediated by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, both in a transgenic mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of H11K and in isolated cardiac myocytes. Microarrays in hearts from transgenic compared to wild-type mice showed an upregulation of the BMP receptors Alk3 and BMPR-II, and of their ligand BMP4 (P<0.01 versus wild type). Activation of the BMP pathway in transgenic mice was confirmed by increased phosphorylation of the \"canonical\" BMP effectors Smad 1/5/8 (P<0.01 versus wild type). In isolated myocytes, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of H11K was accompanied by a significant (P<0.01) increase in PI3K activity, phospho-Akt, Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation and [(3)H]phenylalanine incorporation, and by a 70% reduction in H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis. All these effects were abolished by the BMP antagonist noggin. In presence of BMP4, Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation was enhanced by 5-fold on H11K overexpression but decreased by 3-fold on H11K knockdown (P<0.01 versus control), showing that H11K potentiates the BMP signaling. In pull-down experiments, H11K increased both the association of Alk3 and BMPR-II together, and their interaction with the transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase (TAK)1, a \"noncanonical\" mediator of the BMP receptor signaling. TAK1 inhibition prevented H11K-mediated activation of Akt. Therefore, potentiation of the BMP receptor by H11K promotes an activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway mediated by TAK1, which dictates the physiological effects of H11K on cardiac cell growth and survival.",

          "text": "The P2Y1 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and is stimulated by extracellular ADP and ATP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the three extracellular loops (ELs) of the human P2Y1 receptor indicates the existence of two essential disulfide bridges (Cys124 in EL1 and Cys202 in EL2; Cys42 in the N-terminal segment and Cys296 in EL3) and several specific ionic and H-bonding interactions (involving Glu209 and Arg287). Through molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, an energetically sound conformational hypothesis for the receptor has been calculated that includes transmembrane (TM) domains (using the electron density map of rhodopsin as a template), extracellular loops, and a truncated N-terminal region. ATP may be docked in the receptor, both within the previously defined TM cleft and within two other regions of the receptor, termed meta-binding sites, defined by the extracellular loops. The first meta-binding site is located outside of the TM bundle, between EL2 and EL3, and the second higher energy site is positioned immediately underneath EL2. Binding at both the principal TM binding site and the lower energy meta-binding sites potentially affects the observed ligand potency. In meta-binding site I, the side chain of Glu209 (EL2) is within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.8 A) of the ribose O3', and Arg287 (EL3) coordinates both alpha- and beta-phosphates of the triphosphate chain, consistent with the insensitivity in potency of the 5'-monophosphate agonist, HT-AMP, to mutation of Arg287 to Lys. Moreover, the selective reduction in potency of 3'NH2-ATP in activating the E209R mutant receptor is consistent with the hypothesis of direct contact between EL2 and nucleotide ligands. Our findings support ATP binding to at least two distinct domains of the P2Y1 receptor, both outside and within the TM core. The two disulfide bridges present in the human P2Y1 receptor play a major role in the structure and stability of the receptor, to constrain the loops within the receptor, specifically stretching the EL2 over the opening of the TM cleft and thus defining the path of access to the binding site.",

To begin to elucidate its mechanism of action, we now report the identity of the mammalian homolog to the yeast Sec12 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (18% identity) that promotes Sar1 activation. Mammalian Sec12 (mSec12) is a type II transmembrane protein with a large cytosolic domain, a fragment of which has previously been reported as the transcription factor prolactin regulatory element binding protein (PREB). mSec12 promotes efficient guanine nucleotide exchange on Sar1, but not Arf1 or Rab GTPases. mSec12 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and an antibody to the cytosolic domain of mSec12 potently inhibits Sar1 recruitment and the formation of COPII vesicles in vitro. The dominant negative GDP-restricted mutant Sar1[T39N] is shown to be a potent inhibitor of mSec12 activity, consistent with its role in preventing COPII vesicle formation in vitro and during transient expression in vivo. We propose that mSec12 is an evolutionarily distant guanine nucleotide exchange factor directing Sar1 GTPase activation in mammalian cells. Its divergence from yeast Sec12p may reflect the specialized needs of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum involving the formation of Sar1-dependent transitional elements (Aridor M, et al.

Partial reduction to monomers identified specifically an odd Cys574 residue responsible for dimer formation in one of three anaphylatoxin-like modules that constitute the central globular domain I (13 kDa) of fibulin-2. Furthermore, a Cys574-Ser mutation abolished disulfide connection but not non-covalent dimerization of fibulin-2.

A dimer model is proposed indicating mainly a rod-like shape of 80 nm length based on an anti-parallel association of two subunits through their domains I.

Using co-immuno-purification approaches, the receptor appears to be an oligomer, which can be crosslinked through disulphide bonds involving a native cysteine residue (84) to give a dimeric species. This position is located near the cytosolic region of transmembrane segment 2 and it is suggested that this is an interacting interface between MC(4)R monomers. Using co-expression of the native protein and a C84A mutant, it appears that the receptor also forms higher order oligomers via alternative interfaces. Interestingly, disulphide crosslink formation does not occur if the receptor is uncoupled from its G-protein, even though the oligomeric state is preserved. This suggests that the conformational changes, which occur on activation, affect the TM2 interface. The pharmacology of the agonist, NDP-MSH, indicates that the MC(4)R retains high affinity for the ligand in the absence of the G-protein but occupancy for the ligand is increased. The data can be interpreted to suggest that the G-protein exerts a negative allosteric effect on the receptor. Co-expression of one receptor lacking the ability to signal with another, which cannot bind the agonist, restored ligand-dependent activation of the G-protein to situations in which neither receptor on its own could activate the G-protein. Such transactivation suggests meaningful cross talk between the receptor subunits in the oligomeric complex. These studies demonstrate further unique features of the MC(4)R.",

We have analyzed the functional relevance of several SHANK3 missense mutations affecting the N-terminal portion of the protein by expression of wild-type and mutant Shank3 in cultured neurons and by binding assays in heterologous cells. Postsynaptic targeting of recombinant Shank3 was unaltered. In electrophysiological experiments, both wild-type and L68P mutant forms of Shank3 were equally effective in restoring synaptic function after knockdown of endogenous Shank3. We observed that several mutations affected binding to interaction partners of the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region. One of these mutations, L68P, improved binding to both ligands. Leu-68 is located N-terminal to the ankyrin repeats, in a highly conserved region that we identify here as a novel domain termed the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain. We show that the SPN domain interacts with the ankyrin repeats in an intramolecular manner, thereby restricting access of either Sharpin or \u03b1-fodrin. The L68P mutation disrupts this blockade, thus exposing the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region to its ligands. Our data identify a new type of regulation of Shank proteins and suggest that mutations in the SHANK3 gene do not necessarily induce a loss of function, but may represent a gain of function with respect to specific interaction partners.

To elucidate the regulation of JAK2 kinase, we have built a structural model for the kinase and pseudokinase domains of JAK2. An asymmetric dimer is proposed, in which the kinase domain JH1 occupies a position where it could not be activated. We investigate the dynamic and energetic properties of the dimer by molecular dynamics simulation. JAK2 activation requires the two domains to be dissociated and rearranged in a form such that the JH1 kinase domain can adopt an active conformation. The significance of the above mechanism is emphasized by the finding that the activating V617F mutation destabilizes JH1-JH2 association in the proposed asymmetric dimer. Thus abrogation of the domain-domain interaction seems to be a possible first step for the structural rearrangement of the two domains, resulting in constitutive activation of JAK2 by the V617F mutation.",

In this study we show how a naturally occurring non-synonymous polymorphism at codon 94 of HEY1, which results in a substitution of leucine by methionine (Leu94Met), converts HEY1 from an androgen receptor corepressor to an androgen receptor co-activator without affecting its intrinsic transcriptional repressive domains. The polymorphism Leu94Met also abolishes HEY1-mediated activation of p53 and suppresses the ability of HEY1 to induce p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and aberrant cell differentiation in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Moreover, expression of HEY1, but not of the variant Leu94Met, confers sensitivity to p53-activating chemotherapeutic drugs on U2OS cells. In addition, we have identified motifs in HEY1 that are critical for the regulation of its subcellular localization and analysed how mutations in those motifs affect both HEY1 and HEY1-Leu94Met functions.

These differences suggest that each pathway provides unique biochemical information which is required for T-cell activation. We report here that CD28 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following interaction with B7.1/CD80, which induces formation of a complex with phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, mediated by the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the kinase. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase is a heterodimer of this 85K regulatory subunit and a 110K catalytic subunit, and is a common substrate for most receptor tyrosine kinases and some cytokine receptors, binding through its SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine in the motif Tyr-X-X-Met in the CD28 sequence, which is highly conserved between human, mouse and rat and lies in the intracellular domain. We show that CD28 mutants that have their kinase-binding site deleted or the tyrosine at position 173 substituted by phenylalanine do not associate with the kinase after CD28 stimulation and cannot stimulate production of interleukin-2.

The HPV16 E6-induced degradation of E6TP1 strongly correlates with its ability to immortalize human mammary epithelial cells. In this study, we used treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132, analysis in CHO-ts20 cells with a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and direct detection of ubiquitin-modified E6TP1 to demonstrate that E6TP1 is targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway both in the presence and in the absence of E6. Using deletion mutants of E6TP1, we mapped the region required and sufficient for E6 binding to COOH-terminal 40 amino acid residues and showed this region to be necessary for E6-dependent degradation of E6TP1. Furthermore, the E6-binding region of E6TP1 complexes with E6AP via E6. Importantly, the purified E6AP enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of E6TP1 in the presence of E6 in vitro. Additionally, the expression of a dominant-negative E6AP mutant (C833A) in cells inhibited the E6-induced degradation of E6TP1. These findings demonstrate that the E6-induced decrease in the levels of E6TP1 protein involves the E6AP-mediated ubiquitination followed by proteasome-dependent degradation.",

The enhanced expression of this protein has been shown to activate both the mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the oncogenic potential of Tpl-2 are still largely unknown. Here, we showed that Tpl-2 interacted with p53 both in vitro and ex vivo. The overexpression of Tpl-2 inhibited the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced p53 phosphorylation (Ser15) through upregulating the activity of protein phosphatase 2A, which interacted with p53 stimulated by EGF. Also, the EGF-induced p53 activity was suppressed in the Tpl-2 wild-type (WT)-transfected HEK 293 cells, but had no effect in the Tpl-2-mutant (S413A)-transfected cells. Furthermore, introduction of small interfering RNA-Tpl-2 into HEK 293 cells resulted in decreased cell viability compared with only adenovirus-p53-infected cells. In addition, the Tpl-2 WT, but not Tpl-2 mutant (S413A), showed increased EGF-induced c-fos promoter activity, followed by activator protein 1 (AP-1) transactivation activity, which was associated with the cell transformation prompted by the H-Ras-Tpl-2-AP-1 signaling axis. These results indicated that the Ser413 of Tpl-2 plays an important role in EGF-induced carcinogenesis as well as inactivation of the p53.",

METHODS: A panel of lentivirus plasmids expressing Anxa2-wide type (Ana2-WT), Anxa2-Y23A, and Anxa2-Y23D was generated and infected with SK-BR-3 cells. The monoclonal strains were screened. The expression of Anxa2-WT, Anxa2-Y23A, and Anxa2-Y23D was determined by Western blot analysis. The ability of the cells to proliferate was detected through an MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] test. Boyden chamber assays were employed to examine migration and invasion abilities. The interaction between Anxa2 and Stat3 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation analyses. Nucleoprotein and cytosolic protein were extracted from SK-BR-3, Anxa2-WT, Anxa2-Y23A, and Anxa2-Y23D cells to analyze the expression and localization of Stat3 phosphorylation. RESULTS: The monoclonal strains constitutively expressing Anxa2-WT, Anxa2-Y23A, and Anxa2-Y23D were screened. Both Anxa2-WT and Anxa2-Y23D enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of SK-BR-3 cells (P<0.05). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Anxa2 and Stat3 interacted with each other, and the expression of Stat3 phosphorylation in the nucleus was enhanced by Anxa2-Y23D. CONCLUSIONS: Tyr23 phosphorylation of Anxa2 promotes the proliferation and invasion of human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells and the phosphorylation of Stat3 in the nucleus.",

The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of MCM2-7 proteins contributes to the formation of the MCM2-7 complex. However, the regulation of specific MCM phosphorylation still needs to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that MCM3 is a substrate of cyclin E/Cdk2 and can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 at Thr-722. We find that the MCM3 T722A mutant binds chromatin much less efficiently when compared with wild type MCM3, suggesting that this phosphorylation site is involved in MCM3 loading onto chromatin. Interestingly, overexpression of MCM3, but not MCM3 T722A mutant, inhibits the S phase entry, whereas it does not affect the exit from mitosis. Knockdown of MCM3 does not affect S phase entry and progression, indicating that a small fraction of MCM3 is sufficient for normal S phase completion. These results suggest that excess accumulation of MCM3 protein onto chromatin may inhibit DNA replication. Other studies indicate that excess of MCM3 up-regulates the phosphorylation of CHK1 Ser-345 and CDK2 Thr-14. These data reveal that the phosphorylation of MCM3 contributes to its function in controlling the S phase checkpoint of cell cycle in addition to the regulation of formation of the MCM2-7 complex.",

Current evidence suggests that in addition to the Rab GTPase-activating protein AS160, at least one other substrate of Akt (also called protein kinase B), which is as yet unidentified, is required. Sec8 is a component of the exocyst complex that has been previously implicated in GLUT4 trafficking. In the present study, we report that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of Sec8 on Ser-32 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. On the basis of the sequence around Ser-32 and the finding that phosphorylation is inhibited by the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin, it is likely that Akt is the kinase for Ser-32. We examined the possible role of Ser-32 phosphorylation in the insulin-stimulated trafficking of GLUT4, as well as the TfR (transferrin receptor), to the plasma membrane by determining the effects of overexpression of the non-phosphorylatable S32A mutant of Sec8 and the phosphomimetic S32E mutant of Sec8. Substantial overexpression of both mutants had no effect on the amount of GLUT4 or TfR at the cell surface in either the untreated or insulin-treated states. These results indicate that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Sec8 is not part of the mechanism by which insulin enhances the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane.",

RESULTS: In this work we show that C3G and Bcr-Abl form complexes with the focal adhesion (FA) proteins CrkL, p130Cas, Cbl and Abi1 through SH3/SH3-b interactions. The association between C3G and Bcr-Abl decreased upon Abi1 or p130Cas knock-down in K562 cells, which suggests that Abi1 and p130Cas are essential partners in this interaction. On the other hand, C3G, Abi1 or Cbl knock-down impaired adhesion to fibronectin, while p130Cas silencing enhanced it. C3G, Cbl and p130Cas-SH3-b domains interact directly with common proteins involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies revealed that C3G form complexes with the FA proteins paxillin and FAK and their phosphorylated forms. Additionally, C3G, Abi1, Cbl and p130Cas regulate the expression and phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK. p38\u03b1 MAPK also participates in the regulation of adhesion in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. It interacts with C3G, CrkL, FAK and paxillin and regulates the expression of paxillin, CrkL and \u03b15 integrin, as well as paxillin phosphorylation. Moreover, double knock-down of C3G/p38\u03b1 decreased adhesion to fibronectin, similarly to the single silencing of one of these genes, either C3G or p38\u03b1. These suggest that C3G and p38\u03b1 MAPK are acting through a common pathway to regulate cell adhesion in K562 cells, as previously described for the regulation of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that C3G-p38\u03b1MAPK pathway regulates K562 cell adhesion through the interaction with FA proteins and Bcr-Abl, modulating the formation of different protein complexes at FA.",

None of the non-lentiviral INs possessed detectable affinity for LEDGF in either pull-down or yeast two-hybrid assays. In contrast, all lentiviral INs examined, including those from bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), maedi-visna virus (MVV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) readily interacted with LEDGF. Mutation of Asp-366 to Asn in LEDGF ablated the interaction, suggesting a common mechanism of the host factor recognition by the INs. LEDGF potently stimulated strand transfer activity of divergent lentiviral INs in vitro. Unprecedentedly, in the presence of the host factor, EIAV IN almost exclusively catalyzed concerted integration, whereas HIV-1 IN promoted predominantly half-site integration, and BIV IN was equally active in both types of strand transfer. Concerted BIV and EIAV integration resulted in 5 bp duplications of the target DNA sequences. These results confirm that the interaction with LEDGF is conserved within and limited to Lentivirus and strongly argue that the host factor is intimately involved in the catalysis of lentiviral DNA integration.",

Here we demonstrate that via its phosphorylation by CDK2/Cdc2p34, MdmX regulates nuclear export of Mdm2. Cdc2p34 phosphorylates MdmX on Ser 96 in vitro. Mutation within this site (MdmX(S96A)) impairs, whereas phosphomimic substitution (MdmX(S96D)) increases the cytoplasmic localization of MdmX, suggesting that CDK2/Cdc2p34 phosphorylation is required for export of MdmX from the nucleus. Consequently, cells that express MdmX(S96A) retain Mdm2 in their nuclei, suggesting that export of Mdm2 to the cytoplasm is MdmX-dependent. Similarly, treatment of cells with the pharmacological inhibitor of CDK2/Cdc2p34 or with a dominant-negative Cdc2 results in nuclear localization of MdmX and Mdm2 and decreases the level of Mdm2 expression. Since Cdc2p34 is active in nonstressed conditions, our finding provides a novel insight into the signaling cascade involved in the regulation of MdmX localization and for regulation of Mdm2 localization and stability.",

Furthermore, when amino acid substitutions were introduced at either C49G or C246stop, TRX2 interacted with mtTFA. However, the interaction of TRX2 with mtTFA was enhanced when both mutations (C49G and C246stop) were introduced. Binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA was similar among mutant mtTFA proteins.

One of these pathways entails growth factor receptor transactivation followed by ERK activation. This study demonstrates that a similar signaling pathway is used by the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) expressed in HEK293 cells and involves calmodulin (CaM). Stimulation of MOR resulted in both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ERK phosphorylation. Data obtained with inhibitors of EGFR Tyr kinase and membrane metalloproteases support an intermediate role of EGFR activation, involving release of endogenous membrane-bound epidermal growth factor. Previous studies had demonstrated a role for CaM in opioid signaling based on direct CaM binding to MOR. To test whether CaM contributes to EGFR transactivation and ERK phosphorylation by MOR, we compared wild-type MOR with mutant K273A MOR, which binds CaM poorly, but couples normally to G proteins. Stimulation of K273A MOR with [D-Ala(2),MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (10-100 nm) resulted in significantly reduced ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, wild-type MOR stimulated EGFR Tyr phosphorylation 3-fold more than K273A MOR, indicating that direct CaM-MOR interaction plays a key role in the transactivation process. Inhibitors of CaM and protein kinase C also attenuated [D-Ala(2),MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin-induced EGFR transactivation in wild-type (but not mutant) MOR-expressing cells. This novel pathway of EGFR transactivation may be shared by other G protein-coupled receptors shown to interact with CaM.",

Accordingly, the expression of mutant p53 in tumors often correlates with bad prognosis, and expression of mutant p53 in p53-negative tumor cells enhances their transformed phenotype. The molecular basis for this \"gain of function\" is not yet understood. However, the finding that mutant p53 tightly associates with the nuclear matrix in vivo, and with high affinity binds to nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR) DNA in vitro, suggests that these activities are connected and may result in perturbation of nuclear structure and function in tumor cells. MAR-binding of mutant p53 most likely is due to conformation-selective DNA binding by mutant p53, i.e. the specific interaction of a given mutant p53 protein with regulatory or structural genomic DNA elements that are able to adopt specific non-B-DNA conformations. In support to this assumption, human mutant p53 (Gly(245)-->Ser) was shown to bind to repetitive DNA elements in vivo that might be part of MAR elements. This further supports a model according to which mutant p53, by interacting with key structural components of the nucleus, exerts its oncogenic activities through perturbation of nuclear structure and function.

An aspartic acid-to-lysine change at position 84 (D84K) of ecotropic Moloney MLV Env abolishes virus binding and infection. We recently identified lysine 234 (rK234) in mATRC1 as a residue that influences virus binding and infection. Here we show that D84K virus infection increased 3,000-fold on cells expressing receptor with an rK234A change and 100,000-fold on cells expressing an rK234D change. The stronger complementation of D84K virus infection by rK234D than by the rK234A receptor suggests that although the major reason for loss of infection of D84K and D84R virus is due to steric hindrance and charge repulsion, the loss of an interaction of D84 with receptor appears to contribute as well. Taken together, these results indicate that D84 is very close to rK234 of mATRC1 in the bound complex and there is likely an interaction between them. The definitive localization of the receptor binding site on SU should facilitate the design of chimeric envelope proteins that target infection to new receptors by replacing the receptor binding site with an exogenous ligand sequence.",

Analysis of the dynamic phosphorylation and location of phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) in unperturbed, synchronized cells and during DNA damage-induced G 2 arrest discloses that a pool of phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) accumulates into nucleolar structures in etoposide-exposed cells during G 2 arrest. In a series of in vitro kinase assays, pharmacological inhibitors and specific siRNAs experiments, we found that Polo kinase 1 and MAPK9/JNK2 are major protein kinases involved in Bcl-xL(Ser62) phosphorylation and accumulation into nucleolar structures during the G 2 checkpoint. In nucleoli, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) binds to and co-localizes with Cdk1(cdc2), the key cyclin-dependent kinase required for entry into mitosis. These data indicate that during G 2 checkpoint, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) stabilizes G 2 arrest by timely trapping of Cdk1(cdc2) in nucleolar structures to slow mitotic entry. It also highlights that DNA damage affects the dynamic composition of the nucleolus, which now emerges as a piece of the DNA damage response.",

For this study, circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry and an alanine scanning mutagenesis approach were used in combination to investigate the molecular and conformational mechanisms of this high-affinity protein-ligand interaction. CD analysis revealed that AlbA contains a high-affinity binding site, and binding of the albicidin ligand to AlbA in a low-ionic-strength environment induced significant conformational changes. The ligand-dependent conformational changes of AlbA were specific and rapid and reached a stable plateau within seconds after the addition of the antibiotic. However, such conformational changes were not detected when AlbA and albicidin were mixed in the high-ionic-strength buffer that is required for maximal binding activity. Based on the conceptual model of protein-ligand interaction, we propose that a threshold ion strength allows AlbA to complete its conformational rearrangement and resume its original stable structure for accommodation of the bound albicidin. Mutagenesis analysis showed that the replacement of Lys106, Trp110, Tyr113, Leu114, Tyr126, Pro134, and Trp162 with alanine did not change the overall conformational structure of AlbA but decreased the albicidin binding activity about 30 to 60%. We conclude that these residues, together with the previously identified essential residue His125, constitute a high-affinity binding pocket for the ligand albicidin. The results also suggest that hydrophobic and electrostatic potentials of these key amino acid residues may play important roles in the AlbA-albicidin interaction.",

In the Ang II receptor type AT2, this Lysine residue is conserved at position 215 in the fifth transmembrane domain. To determine the specific mechanism of ligand binding to the Angiotensin II receptor type AT2, mutated AT2 receptors were generated in which the Lys215 was replaced with glutamic acid, glutamine, alanine and arginine. The ability of these mutated receptors to bind peptidic ligands 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II (non-specific for AT2 receptor type), 125I-CGP42112A (AT2 receptor specific) and the non-peptidic ligand PD123319 (AT2 receptor specific) was evaluated by expressing these receptors in Xenopus oocytes and performing binding assays. The Lys215Glu and Lys215Gln mutants of AT2 receptor lost their affinity to 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II, but retained their affinity to 125I-CGP42112A and PD123319. In contrast, Lys215Arg mutant retained its affinity to 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II, but exhibited lower affinity to 125I-CGP42112A. The Lys215Ala mutant lost its affinity to both 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II and 125I-CGP42112A. These results suggest that the binding mechanism of 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II to AT2 receptor is similar to that of AT1 receptor since an amino acid with positively charged side chain (Lys or Arg) located in the fifth transmembrane domain is required for this ligand to bind AT2 receptor. In contrast, although CGP42112A is a peptidic ligand, it does not require an interaction between its C-terminal carboxylate group and the positively charged side-chain of an amino acid in the fifth transmembrane domain for its binding to AT2 receptor.",

Mutations of B-Raf occur with the highest incidences in melanoma, and the most common mutant, V600E, renders B-Raf constitutively active. The sodium proton exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein responsible for regulating intracellular pH, cell volume, cell migration, and proliferation. A screen of protein kinases that bind to NHE1 revealed that B-Raf bound to the cytosolic regulatory tail of NHE1. Immunoprecipitation of NHE1 from HeLa and HEK cells confirmed the association of B-Raf with NHE1 in vivo. The expressed and purified C-terminal 182 amino acids of the NHE1 protein were also shown to associate with B-Raf protein in vitro. Because treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib decreased NHE1 activity in HeLa and HEK cells, we examined the role of B-Raf in regulating NHE1 in malignant melanoma cells. Melanoma cells with the B-Raf(V600E) mutation demonstrated increased resting intracellular pH that was dependent on elevated NHE1 activity. NHE1 activity after an acute acid load was also elevated in these cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of B-Raf activity by either sorafenib, PLX4720, or siRNA reduction of B-Raf levels abolished ERK phosphorylation and decreased NHE1 activity. These results demonstrate that B-Raf associates with and stimulates NHE1 activity and that B-Raf(V600E) also increases NHE1 activity that raises intracellular pH.",

In HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, we found that syndecan-2 regulated migration, invasion into Matrigel, and anchorage-independent growth but not cell-extracellular matrix adhesion or proliferation, suggesting that syndecan-2 plays different functional roles in fibrosarcoma and colon carcinoma cells. Consistent with the increased cell migration/invasion of syndecan-2-overexpressing HT1080 cells, syndecan-2 overexpression increased phosphorylation and interaction of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), membrane localization of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis gene-1 (Tiam-1), and activation of Rac. Syndecan-2-mediated cell migration/invasion of HT1080 cells was diminished when (a) cells were cotransfected with nonphosphorylatable mutant FAK Y397F or with other FAK mutants lacking PI3K interactions, (b) cells were treated with a specific PI3K inhibitor, or (c) levels of Tiam-1 were knocked down with small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, expression of several FAK mutants inhibited syndecan-2-mediated enhancement of anchorage-independent growth in HT1080 cells.

Our studies revealed that the Parkinson's disease-linked L166P mutation impaired the intrinsic folding propensity of DJ-1 protein, resulting in a spontaneously unfolded structure that was incapable of forming a homodimer with itself or a heterodimer with wild-type DJ-1. Correlating with the disruption of DJ-1 structure, the L166P mutation abolished the catalytic function of DJ-1. Furthermore, as a result of protein misfolding, the L166P mutant DJ-1 was selectively polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasome.

G971R is located near src homology 2 protein binding sites, and P170R and M209T are located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1. 32D-IR cells, stably overexpressing human insulin receptor, were transfected with wild-type human IRS-1 cDNA (WT) or three mutant IRS-1 cDNAs and analyzed. All the cell lines expressing mutant IRS-1 showed a significant reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with WT. Upon insulin stimulation, cells expressing G971R showed a 39% decrease (P < 0.005) in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity, a 43% decrease (P < 0.01) in binding of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a 22% decrease (P < 0.05) in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity compared with those expressing WT.

G971R showed no changes in IRS-1 phosphorylation and in IRS-1 binding to the insulin receptor compared with WT.

CPP32, a cysteine protease, was shown previously to cleave SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in vitro at an aspartic acid between the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain and the first trans-membrane domain, liberating a transcriptionally active fragment. Here, we show that CPP32 exists in an inactive 32 kDa form in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. When apoptosis was induced with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, CPP32 was cleaved to subunits of 20 and 10 kDa to form the active protease. Under these conditions membrane-bound SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were both cleaved, and the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragments were found in nuclear extracts. Similar results were obtained in human U937 cells induced to undergo apoptosis by anti-Fas and etoposide. The apoptosis-induced cleavage of SREBPs was not suppressed by sterols, indicating that apoptosis-induced cleavage and sterol-regulated cleavage are mediated by different proteases. CHO cells expressing a mutant SREBP-2 with an Asp--> Ala mutation at the CPP32 cleavage site showed sterol-regulated cleavage but no apoptosis-induced cleavage. These data are consistent with the emerging concept that CPP32 is a central mediator in apoptosis. They also indicate that SREBPs, like poly (ADP) ribose polymerase, are cleaved by CPP32 during programmed cell death.",

Gene amplification and overexpression of ACK1 were found in many cancer types such as those of the lung and prostate. Previously, we identified both somatic- and germ line missense mutations in the ACK1 coding sequence, by surveying 261 cancer cell lines and 15 control tissues. Here, we verified and characterized the non-synonymous mutation, ACK-S985 N, located in the ubiquitin association domain of the protein. Both overexpression and silencing experiments in MCF7 and A498 cells, respectively, demonstrated a role of the ACK1 S985 N mutation in enhancing cell proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Further, we showed that the ACK1 S985 N mutant is unable to bind ubiquitin, unlike the wild type kinase. This contributed to ACK1 protein stability and stabilized EGFR after EGF stimulation, thereby prolonging mitogenic signaling in cancer cells. In addition, the ACK1 S985 N-EGFR interaction is enhanced, but not the ubiquitination of the receptor. Intriguingly, silencing of ACK1 in A498 cells sensitized the renal carcinoma cells to gefitinib, against which they are otherwise resistant. The work demonstrates that other than gene amplification, a single somatic mutation in ACK1 can result in extended protein stability enabling the oncoprotein to exert its oncogenic function in tumor progression. It also provides a rationale to target ACK1 in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as EGFR inhibitors, to potentiate therapeutic action against resistant tumors.",

We performed in vitro kinase assays using as substrate either a GST-fusion wild-type (WT) FANCA fragment or a GST-fusion FANCA fragment containing a mutation from serine to alanine at 1149 (FANCA-S1149A). These experiments confirmed that FANCA is phosphorylated at Ser 1149, in vitro. However, (32)P-orthophosphate labeling experiments revealed that FANCA-S1149A was more efficiently phosphorylated than WT-FANCA.

To further examine the link between the hyperactivation of Cdc42 and its ability to alter EGFR signaling and thereby cause cellular transformation, we examined the effects of expressing different forms of the Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, intersectin-L, in fibroblasts. Full-length intersectin-L exhibited little ability to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Cdc42, whereas a truncated version that contained five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, the Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains (DH and PH domains, respectively), and a C2 domain (designated as SH3A-C2) showed modest guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, whereas a form containing just the DH, PH, and C2 domains (DH-C2) strongly activated Cdc42. However, DH-C2 showed little ability to stimulate growth in low serum or colony formation in soft agar, whereas SH3A-C2 gave rise to a much stronger stimulation of cell growth in low serum and was highly effective in stimulating colony formation. Moreover, although SH3A-C2 strongly transformed fibroblasts, it differed from the actions of the Cdc42(F28L) mutant, as SH3A-C2 showed little ability to alter EGFR levels or the lifetime of EGF-coupled signaling through ERK. Rather, we found that SH3A-C2 exhibited strong transforming activity through its ability to mediate cooperation between Ras and Cdc42.",

CaM binds to the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) domain (Met645-Phe688) of EGFR. Protein kinase C (PKC) mediated phosphorylation of Thr654 occurs within this domain. CaM binding to the JM domain inhibits PKC phosphorylation and conversely PKC mediated phosphorylation of Thr654 or Glu substitution of Thr654 inhibits CaM binding. A second threonine residue (Thr669) within the JM domain is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Previous results have shown that CaM interferes with EGFR-induced MAPK activation. If and how phosphorylation of Thr669 affects CaM-EGFR interaction is however not known. In the present study we have used surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) to study the influence of Thr669 phosphorylation on real time interactions between the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) domain of EGFR and CaM. The EGFR-JM was expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and phosphorylation was mimicked by generating Glu substitutions of either Thr654 or Thr669. Purified proteins were coupled to immobilized anti-GST antibodies at the sensor surface and increasing concentration of CaM was applied. When mutating Thr654 to Glu654 no specific CaM binding could be detected. However, neither single substitutions of Thr669 (Gly669 or Glu669) nor double mutants Gly654/Gly669 or Gly654/Glu669 influenced the binding of CaM to the EGFR-JM. This clearly shows that PKC may regulate EGF-mediated CaM signalling through phosphorylation of Thr654 whereas phosphorylation of Thr669 seems to play a CaM independent regulatory role. The role of both residues in the EGFR-calmodulin interaction was also studied in silico. Our modelling work supports a scenario where Thr654 from the JM domain interacts with Glu120 in the calmodulin molecule. Phosphorylation of Thr654 or Glu654 substitution creates a repulsive electrostatic force that would diminish CaM binding to the JM domain. These results are in line with the Biacore experiments showing a weak binding of the CaM to the JM domain with Thr654 mutated to Glu. Furthermore, these results provide a hypothesis to how CaM binding to EGFR might both positively and negatively interfere with EGFR-activity.",

Two members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PlGF), which are able to heterodimerize if coexpressed in the same cell, are both required for pathologic angiogenesis. We have generated a PlGF1 variant, named PlGF1-DE in which the residues Asp72 and Glu73 were substituted with Ala, which is unable to bind and activate VEGF receptor-1 but is still able to heterodimerize with VEGF. Here, we show that overexpression in tumor cells by adenoviral delivery or stable transfection of PlGF1-DE variant significantly reduces the production of VEGF homodimer via heterodimerization, determining a strong inhibition of xenograft tumor growth and neoangiogenesis, as well as significant reduction of vessel lumen and stabilization, and monocyte-macrophage infiltration. Conversely, the overexpression of PlGF1wt, also reducing the VEGF homodimer production comparably with PlGF1-DE variant through the generation of VEGF/PlGF heterodimer, does not inhibit tumor growth and vessel density compared with controls but induces increase of vessel lumen, vessel stabilization, and monocyte-macrophage infiltration. The property of PlGF and VEGF-A to generate heterodimer represents a successful strategy to inhibit VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. The PlGF1-DE variant, and not PlGF1wt as previously reported, acts as a \"dominant negative\" of VEGF and is a new candidate for antiangiogenic gene therapy in cancer treatment.",

The purpose of this study was to determine which domain(s) in the CaN B subunit is required for either binding to the CaN A subunit or for transducing the effects of B subunit Ca2+ binding to the stimulation of the CaN A subunit phosphatase activity. We have previously demonstrated that interaction of CaN B regulatory subunit with the CaN A catalytic subunit requires hydrophobic residues within the CaN A sequence 328-390 [Watanabe Y., Perrino, B.A., Chang, B.H., & Soderling, T.R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 456-460]. In the present study, selected hydrophobic residues within the B subunit were mutated to Glu to Gln. CaN B subunit mutants BE-1 (Val115/Leu116 to Glu), BE-2 (Val156/157/168/169 to Glu), and BQ-2 (Val156/157/168/169 to Gln) were expressed and purified. The three mutant B subunits bound 45Ca2+ normally. Mutants BE-2 and BQ-2 interacted with a GST fusion protein containing the B subunit binding domain of the CaN A subunit (residues 328-390), and they stimulated the phosphatase activity of the CaN A subunit in an in vitro reconstitution assay. Mutant BE-1 had a 3-fold reduced affinity for binding CaN A, and this mutant, even at saturating concentrations, gave very little stimulation of CaN A phosphatase activity. We conclude that residues Val115/Leu116 in the B subunit participate in high-affinity binding to the A subunit and are required for transducing the effects [i.e., decrease Km and increase Vmax; Perrino, B.A., Ng, L.Y., & Soderling, T.R.

The dependence of agonist binding on the dithiothreitol concentration followed a monophasic curve for wild-type hMC4R and its C40A, C271A, and C279A mutants and a biphasic curve for hMC1R, suggesting the presence of at least one structurally and functionally essential disulfide bond in both wild-type receptors and the hMC4R mutants. Models of complexes of both receptors with the ASIP fragment and hMC4R with the AGRP fragment were calculated using constraints from the experimental structures of rhodopsin and AGRP fragments, a set of deduced hydrogen bonds, supplemented by two proposed disulfide bridges and receptor-ligand contacts, derived from our mutagenesis data. In the models of the ASIP fragment complexed with both receptors, the core ligand tripeptide, Arg-Phe-Phe, positioned between TMHs 3 and 6, is shifted toward TMHs 2 and 7 relative to its position in the AGRP-hMC4R model, while the N-terminal loop and two central disulfides of the antagonists interact with EL2 of the receptors.",

Tyrosine 115 is located in domain II of the protein (the xenobiotic substrate binding domain) and is the first residue in this domain to be shown to play a direct role in catalysis. The 1.8-A structure of isoenzyme 3-3 in complex with (9S,10S)-9-(S-glutathionyl)-10-hydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, one of the diastereomeric products of the reaction of GSH with phenanthrene 9,10-oxide, indicates that the hydroxyl group of Tyr115 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the 10-hydroxyl group of the bound product and, by implication, is proximal to the oxirane oxygen of the substrate in the Michaelis complex. Site-specific replacement of Tyr115 with phenylalanine has profoundly different effects on catalysis depending on the type of reaction and whether the rate-limiting step in catalysis is a chemical step or a physical step. Stopped flow measurements of the rate constants for product release and viscosity effects on the steady-state kinetics establish that the rate-limiting step in catalysis with phenanthrene 9,10-oxide (kcat = 0.4 s-1) is probably a chemical one, whereas the physical step of product dissociation (koff) is rate-limiting in the reaction of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (kcat = 20 s-1). The Y115F mutant is severely impaired in catalyzing the addition of GSH to phenanthrene 9,10-oxide (kcat = 0.0044 s-1), evidence that the -OH of Tyr115 provides electrophilic assistance in the epoxide ring opening. In contrast, the Y115F mutant is a better catalyst toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (kcat = 72 s-1) than is the native enzyme. The enhanced rates of product release in the mutant are ascribed to the loss of hydrogen bonds between the -OH of Tyr115 and the side chain -OH and main chain NH of serine 209, interactions that block the channel to the active site or inhibit the segmental motion of the protein.",

The TRPM7 alpha-kinase domain assembles into a dimer through the exchange of an N-terminal segment that extends from residue 1551 to residue 1577 [Yamaguchi, Matsushita, Nairn and Kuriyan (2001) Mol. Cell 7, 1047-1057]. Here, we show, by analysis of truncation mutants, that residues 1553-1562 of the N-terminus are essential for kinase activity but not dimer formation. Within this 'activation sequence', site-directed mutagenesis identified Tyr-1553 and Arg-1558 as residues critical for activity. Examination of the TRPM7 kinase domain structure suggests that the activation sequence interacts with the other subunit to help position a catalytic loop that contains the invariant Asp-1765 residue. Residues 1563-1570 of the N-terminal segment are critical for dimer assembly. Mutation of Leu-1564, Ile-1568 or Phe-1570 to alanine abolished both kinase activity and dimer formation. The activity of a monomeric TRPM7 kinase domain lacking the entire N-terminal segment was rescued by a GST (glutathione transferase) fusion protein containing residues 1548-1576 of TRPM7, showing that all interactions essential for activity are provided by the N-terminal segment. Activity was also restored by GST fused to the N-terminal segment of TRPM6 (residues 1711-1740), demonstrating the feasibility of forming functional TRPM6-TRPM7 alpha-kinase domain heterodimers. It is proposed that covalent modifications or binding interactions that alter the conformation of the N-terminal exchanged segment may provide a means to regulate TRPM7 kinase activity.",

Gel overlay assay shows that a mutant calmodulin with the F92A alteration has severely reduced binding affinity to a GST-Myo2p fusion protein. Random replacement and site-directed mutagenesis at position 92 of calmodulin indicate that hydrophobic and aromatic residues are allowed at this position, suggesting an importance of hydrophobic interaction between calmodulin and Myo2p. To analyze other components involved in actin organization through calmodulin, we isolated and characterized mutations that show synthetic lethal interaction with cmd1-226; these \"cax\" mutants fell into five complementation groups. Interestingly, all the mutations themselves affect actin organization. Unlike cax2, cax3, cax4, and cax5 mutations, cax1 shows allele-specific synthetic lethality with the cmd1A allele. CAX1 is identical to ANP1/GEM3/MCD2, which is involved in protein glycosylation. CAX4 is identical to the ORF YGR036c, and CAX5 is identical to MNN10/SLC2/BED1.

Activation of other Ndr kinases involves both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by an upstream kinase. Previous reports suggest that the Nak1 kinase functions upstream from Orb6. Supporting this model, we show that HA-Orb6 overexpression partially restored cell polarity in nak1 ts cells. We also demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays that Nak1 and Orb6 physically interact, and that the Nak1 C-terminal region is required for Nak1/Orb6 complex formation in vivo. However, results from in vitro kinase assays did not show phosphorylation of recombinant Orb6 by HA-Nak1, suggesting that Orb6 activation may not involve direct phosphorylation by Nak1. To investigate the role of Orb6 phosphorylation and activity, we substituted Ala at the ATP-binding and conserved phosphorylation sites. Overexpression of kinase-dead HA-Orb6(K122A) in wild-type cells resulted in a loss of cell polarity, suggesting that it has a dominant-negative effect, and it failed to rescue the polarity defect of nak1 or orb6 ts mutants. Recombinant GST-Orb6(S291A) did not autophosphorylate in vitro suggesting that Ser291 is the primary autophosphorylation site. HA-Orb6(S291A) overexpression only partially rescued the orb6 polarity defect and failed to rescue the nak1 defect, suggesting that autophosphorylation is important for Orb6 function. GST-Orb6(T456A) autophosphorylated in vitro, indicating that the conserved phosphorylation site at Thr456 is not essential for kinase activity. However, HA-Orb6(T456A) overexpression had similar effects as overexpressing kinase-dead HA-Orb6(K122A), suggesting that Thr456 is essential for Orb6 function in vivo. Also, we found that both phosphorylation site mutations impaired the ability of Myc-Nak1 to coimmunoprecipitate with HA-Orb6. Together, our results suggest a model whereby autophosphorylation of Ser291 and phosphorylation of Thr456 by an upstream kinase promote Nak1/Orb6 complex formation and Orb6 activation.",

This progression is usually accompanied by altered function of the estrogen receptor (ER) or outgrowth of ER-negative cancer cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for metastatic growth of ER-negative breast cancers, the activities of the transcription factor NF-kappaB (which modulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and metastasis) were compared in ER-positive (MCF-7 and T47-D) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435) human breast cancer cell lines. NF-kappaB, which is usually maintained in an inactive state by protein-protein interaction with inhibitor IkappaBs, was found to be constitutively active in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. Constitutive DNA binding of NF-kappaB was also observed with extracts from ER-negative, poorly differentiated primary breast tumors. Progression of the rat mammary carcinoma cell line RM22-F5 from an ER-positive, nonmalignant phenotype (E phenotype) to an ER-negative, malignant phenotype (F phenotype) was also accompanied by constitutive activation of NF-kappaB. Analysis of individual subunits of NF-kappaB revealed that all ER-negative cell lines, including RM22-F5 cells of F phenotype, contain a unique 37-kDa protein which is antigenically related to the RelA subunit. Cell-type-specific differences in IkappaB alpha, -beta, and -gamma were also observed. In transient-transfection experiments, constitutive activity of an NF-kappaB-dependent promoter was observed in MDA-MB-231 and RM22-F5 cells of F phenotype, and this activity was efficiently repressed by cotransfected ER. Since ER inhibits the constitutive as well as inducible activation function of NF-kappaB in a dose-dependent manner, we propose that breast cancers that lack functional ER overexpress NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Furthermore, since recent data indicate that NF-kappaB protects cells from tumor necrosis factor alpha-, ionizing radiation-, and chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin-mediated apoptosis, our results provide an explanation for chemotherapeutic resistance in ER-negative breast cancers.",

Co-expression of the Phe303 mutants also inhibited (-)epinephrine-stimulated IP signalling by wild-type alpha(1B)-AR and other G(q)-coupled receptors, as well as IP signalling mediated by AlF(4)(-) stimulation of both wild-type G(q alpha) and a constitutively active mutant. The inability of the Phe303 mutants to signal is due to induction of a receptor conformation that dissociates G-protein binding from activation. As a result, the Phe303 mutants sequester G(q alpha) and stoichiometrically inhibit Gq signalling in a dominant-negative manner. We further show that both the enhanced basal and agonist-stimulated IP-signalling activity of the constitutively active alpha(1B)-AR mutants, C128F and A293E, are inhibited in the double mutants, C128F/F303G and A293E/F303G.

(2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 6573-6581). To examine the function of PsaA-Trp(651) in binding and electron transfer of both donors to PSI, we generated the mutants PsaA-W651F and PsaA-W651S by site-directed mutagenesis and biolistic transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The protein-protein interaction and the electron transfer between the donors and PSI isolated from the mutants were analyzed by flash absorption spectroscopy. The mutation PsaA-W651F completely abolished the formation of a first order electron transfer complex between plastocyanin (pc) and the altered PSI and increased the dissociation constant for binding of cytochrome (cyt) c(6) by more than a factor of 10 as compared with wild type. Mutation of PsaA-Trp(651) to Ser had an even larger impact on the dissociation constant. The K(D) value increased another 2-fold when the values obtained for the interaction and electron transfer between cyt c(6) and PSI from PsaA-W651S and PsaA-W651F are compared. In contrast, binding and electron transfer of pc to PSI from PsaA-W651S improved as compared with PSI from PsaA-W651F and admitted the formation of an inter-molecular electron transfer complex, resulting in a K(D) value of about 554 microm that is still five times higher than observed for wild type. These results demonstrate that PsaA-Trp(651) is, such as PsaB-Trp(627), crucial for high affinity binding of pc and cyt c(6) to PSI. Our results also indicate that the highly conserved structural recognition motif that is formed by PsaA-Trp(651) and PsaB-Trp(627) confers a differential selectivity in binding of both donors to PSI.",

Phosphorylation of FoxOs by Akt inhibits transcriptional functions of FoxOs and contributes to cell survival, growth and proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests involvement of FoxOs in diverse intracellular signaling pathways with critical roles in a number of physiological as well as pathological conditions including cancer. The FoxO signaling is regulated by their interactions with other intracellular proteins as well as their post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. FoxOs promote cell growth inhibitory and/or apoptosis signaling by either inducing expression of multiple pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl2-family of mitochondria-targeting proteins, stimulating expression of death receptor ligands such as Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), or enhancing levels of various cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Coupled with their ability to cross-talk with p53, FoxOs represent an important class of tumor suppressors in a variety of cancers. This review summarizes our current understanding of mechanisms by which Akt and FoxOs regulate cell growth and survival that in turn offers opportunities for development of novel strategies to combat cancer.

In contrast, the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a negatively regulated target of AKT1 signaling, antagonizes self-renewal. Here, we show that PI3K/AKT1 signaling promotes self-renewal by suppressing GSK3beta activity and restricting its access to nuclear substrates such as c-myc. GSK3beta shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in mESCs but accumulates in the cytoplasm in an inactive form due to AKT1-dependent nuclear export and inhibitory phosphorylation. When PI3K/AKT1 signaling declines following leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal, active GSK3beta accumulates in the nucleus, where it targets c-myc through phosphorylation on threonine 58 (T58), promoting its degradation. Ectopic nuclear localization of active GSK3beta promotes differentiation, but this process is blocked by a mutant form of c-myc (T58A) that evades phosphorylation by GSK3beta. This novel mechanism explains how AKT1 promotes self-renewal by regulating the activity and localization of GSK3beta. This pathway converges on c-myc, a key regulator of mESC self-renewal.",

Wild type (WT) TP53 binds to BRCA1and RAD51 in vivo and in vitro. However, mutated TP53 in tumours can interfere with WT TP53 function. We studied how mutation of TP53 in MDA-MB-468 cell line could affect its binding capacity and interfere with WT TP53 interaction with these DNA repair proteins. METHODS: Binding capacity of mutated TP53 in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line to BRCA1 and RAD51 proteins in comparison to WT TP53 in MCF7 cell line was studied by Immunoprecipitation. In vitro studies were performed by GST-WT p53 pull-down assays in these cell lines to assess the interaction of GST-WT p53 with BRCA1 and RAD51 proteins. RESULTS: The results showed that mutated TP53 in MDA-MB-468 cells interacted with BRCA1 protein in vivo and did not effect WT TP53 binding to this protein in vitro. The Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the mutated TP53 did not bind to RAD51 in comparison to WT TP53. However, this mutated protein could not interfere with binding of RAD51 to GST-WT p53 in MDA-MB-468 cell line by in vitro experiment. CONCLUSION: It was found that WT TP53 interactions with BRCA1 and RAD51 did not interfere with mutated TP53 in MDA-MB-468 cell line.

In certain forms of the inherited platelet disorder, Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) may interact normally with fibrin yet fail to support fibrinogen-dependent aggregation. We describe a patient (LD) with such a form of GT. Platelets from LD supported normal clot retraction but failed to bind fibrinogen. Platelet analysis using flow cytometry and immunoblotting showed reduced but clearly detectable alpha(IIb)beta(3), findings consistent with type II GT. Genotyping of LD revealed 2 novel beta(3) mutations: a deletion of nucleotides 867 to 868, resulting in a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 267, and a T883C missense mutation, resulting in a leucine (Leu) 262-to-proline (Pro) substitution. Leu262 is highly conserved among beta integrin subunits and lies within an intrachain loop implicated in subunit association. Leu262Probeta(3) cotransfected with wild-type alpha(IIb) into COS-7 cells showed delayed intracellular maturation and reduced surface expression of easily dissociable complexes. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, Leu262Probeta(3) formed a complex with endogenous a(v) and retracted fibrin clots similarly to wild-type beta(3). The same cells, however, were unable to bind immobilized fibrinogen. The molecular requirements for alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with fibrin compared with fibrinogen, therefore, appear to differ.

In this study, we have investigated the role of AURKA in regulating glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta and beta-catenin/TCF complex in gastric cancer cells. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser 9 following the overexpression of AURKA in AGS cells. The immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for AURKA and GSK-3beta indicated that the two proteins coexist in the same protein complex. The recombinant human AURKA protein phosphorylated the GSK-3beta protein at Ser 9 in a concentration-dependent manner, in vitro. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) by GSK-3beta is known to target beta-catenin towards degradation. In line with our findings, the increase in phospho-GSK-3beta level was accompanied by a significant decrease in beta-catenin phosphorylation (Ser33/37/Thr41) and accumulation of beta-catenin protein. The knockdown of AURKA reversed the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and the beta-catenin protein levels. The immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated colocalization of AURKA and GSK-3beta proteins and a significant increase in the nuclear beta-catenin levels in cells overexpressing AURKA. The beta-catenin/TCF transcription activity was measured using the pTopFlash and its mutant pFopFlash luciferase reporter vectors. Indeed, AURKA overexpression led to a significant increase in the pTopFlash reporter activity, whereas kinase dead AURKA mutant (D274A) had no effect. Consistent with these findings, we detected a significant mRNA up-regulation of several direct targets of the beta-catenin/TCF transcription complex (cyclin D1, c-MYC, c-MYC-binding protein, CLDN1, FGF18 and vascular endothelial growth factor), and a two-fold increase in the proliferation rate in AURKA overexpressing cells. We conclude that the AURKA/GSK-3beta interaction is important in regulating beta-catenin, underscoring a novel oncogenic potential for AURKA in gastric tumorigenesis.",

Binding of SkzL to Pg and Pm is completely lysine-binding site-dependent, as shown by the effect of the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid. Deletion of the COOH-terminal SkzL Lys(415) residue reduces affinity for [Lys]Pg and active site-blocked Pm 30-fold, implicating Lys(415) in a lysine-binding site interaction with a Pg/Pm kringle. SkzL binding to active site fluorescein-labeled Pg/Pm analogs demonstrates distinct high and low affinity interactions. High affinity binding is mediated by Lys(415), whereas the source of low affinity binding is unknown. SkzL enhances the activation of [Glu]Pg by urokinase (uPA) approximately 20-fold, to a maximum rate indistinguishable from that for [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg activation in the presence of 6-aminohexanoic acid. SkzL binds preferentially to the partially extended beta-conformation of [Glu]Pg, which is in unfavorable equilibrium with the compact alpha-conformation, thereby converting [Glu]Pg to the fully extended gamma-conformation and accelerating the rate of its activation by uPA. SkzL enhances [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg activation by single-chain tissue-type Pg activator, approximately 42- and approximately 650-fold, respectively. SkzL increases the rate of plasma clot lysis by uPA and single-chain tissue-type Pg activator approximately 2-fold, confirming its cofactor activity in a physiological model system.

This clone is highly homologous (> 99% amino acid identity) to bovine brain p110 alpha, but contains 10 amino acid differences from the human p110 alpha sequence previously reported. Comparison of this sequence with known Ser/Thr kinases and p110 homologs highlighted several conserved residues within the putative kinase domain. Mutational analysis of these residues (Asp915, (Asp933 + Phe934)) yielded P13K mutants with virtually complete loss of phosphoinositide phosphorylating activity. Expression of the wild-type p110 alpha protein in CHO cells is sufficient to activate the serum response element derived from the promoter of c-fos, an immediate early gene product. In contrast, the catalytically impaired p110 alpha mutants as well as the p85 alpha subunit of P13K were inactive in the fos assay. These studies suggest that the mitogenic signal transduction pathway mediated by P13K is dependent upon the enzymatic activity of the p110 alpha subunit of P13K.",

The less geometrically constrained retinal analogue 9-demethyl-retinal prevents efficient transformation of rhodopsin to signaling metarhodopsin (Meta) II after retinal photoisomerization. Here, we demonstrate that Ala replacement mutations within the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F domain, which eliminate an interaction between aromatic residues Y306 and F313, allow formation of Meta II despite the presence of 9-demethyl-retinal. Also a disulfide bond linking residues 306 and 313 in the 9-demethyl-retinal-reconstituted mutant Y306C/F313C/C316S prevented Meta II formation, whereas the reduced form of the mutant readily transformed to Meta II after illumination. These observations suggest that the interaction between residues 306 and 313 is disrupted during the Meta I/Meta II transition. However, this enhancement in Meta II formation is not reflected in the G protein activation, which is dramatically reduced for these mutants, suggesting that changes in the Y306-F313 interaction also lead to a proper realigning of helix 8 after photoisomerization. The E134Q mutation, located in the second conserved motif, D(E)RY, rescues activity in 9-demethyl-retinal-reconstituted mutants to different degrees, depending on the position of the Ala replacement in the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F motif, thus revealing distinct roles for the NP and Y(x)(5,6)F portions. Our studies underscore the importance of the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F and D(E)RY motifs in providing structural constraints in rhodopsin that rearrange in response to photoisomerization during formation of the G protein-activating Meta II. The dual control of the structural rearrangements secures reliable transformation of quiescent rhodopsin to activating Meta II.",

The functional properties of uPA and the significance of its various domains for chemotactic activity were analyzed using human airway smooth muscle cells (hAWSMC). The wild-type uPA (r-uPAwt), inactive urokinase with single mutation (His(204) to Gln) (r-uPA(H/Q)), urokinase with mutation of His(204) to Gln together with a deletion of growth factor-like domain (r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD), the catalytic domain of urokinase (r-uPA(LMW)), and its kringle domain (r-KD) were expressed in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that glycosylated uPA, r-uPAwt, r-uPA(H/Q), and r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD elicited similar chemotactic effects. Half-maximal chemotaxis (EC(50)) were apparent at approximately 2 nm with all the uPA variants. The kringle domain induced cell migration with an EC(50) of about 6 nm, whereas the denaturated r-KD and r-uPA(LMW) were without effect. R-uPAwt-induced chemotaxis was dependent on an association with uPAR and a uPA-kringle domain-binding site, determined using a monoclonal uPAR antibody to prevent the uPA-uPAR interaction, and a monoclonal antibody to the uPA-kringle domain. The binding of iodinated r-uPAwt with hAWSMC was due to interaction with a high affinity binding site on the uPAR, and a lower affinity binding site on an unidentified cell surface target, which was mediated exclusively through the kringle domain of urokinase. Specific binding of r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD to hAWSMC involved an interaction with a single site whose characteristics were similar to those of the low affinity site of r-uPAwt binding to hAWSMC. uPAR-deficient HEK 293 cells specifically bound r-uPAwt and r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD via a single, similar type of binding site. These cells migrated when stimulated by r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD and uPAwt, but not r-uPA(LMW). HEK 293 cells transfected with the uPAR cDNA expressed two classes of sites that bound r-uPAwt; however, only a single site was responsible for the binding of r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD. Together, these findings indicate that uPA-induced chemotaxis is dependent on the binding of the uPA-kringle to the membrane surface of cells and the association of uPA with uPAR.",

Bernard-Soulier syndrome results from a qualitative or quantitative defect in one or more components of the platelet membrane GPIb-V-IX complex. We describe the molecular basis of a novel Bernard-Soulier syndrome variant in two siblings in whom GPIbalpha was not detected on the platelet surface but that was present in a soluble form in plasma. DNA sequence analysis showed that the affected individuals were compound heterozygotes for two mutations. One, inherited from a maternal allele, a T777 --> C point mutation in GPIbalpha converting Cys65 --> Arg within the second leucine rich repeat, the other, a single nucleotide substitution (G2078 --> A) for the tryptophan codon (TGG) causing a nonsense codon (TGA) at residue 498 within the transmembrane region of GPIbalpha, inherited from a mutant paternal allele. The Bernard-Soulier phenotype was observed in siblings who were compound heterozygotes for these two mutations. Although GPIbalpha was not detected on the surface of the patient's platelets, soluble GPIbalpha could be immunoprecipitated from plasma. When plasmids encoding GPIbalpha containing the Cys65 --> Arg mutation were transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the GPbeta-IX complex (CHObetaIX), the expression of GPIbalpha was similar to the wild-type (WT) GPIbalpha, but did not bind vWF. When plasmids encoding GPIbalpha containing the Trp498 --> stop were transiently transfected into CHObetaIX, the surface expression of GPIbalpha was barely detectable compared with the WT GPIbalpha. Thus, this newly described compound heterozygous defect produces Bernard-Soulier syndrome by a combination of synthesis of a nonfunctional protein and of a truncated protein that fails to insert into the platelet membrane and is found circulating in plasma.",

Individuals with heart failure have defective positive FFR that impairs their cardiac function in response to stress, and the degree of positive FFR deficiency correlates with heart failure progression. We have identified a mechanism for FFR involving heart rate dependent phosphorylation of the major cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR2), at Ser2814, by calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase-delta (CaMKIIdelta). Mice engineered with an RyR2-S2814A mutation have RyR2 channels that cannot be phosphorylated by CaMKIIdelta, and exhibit a blunted positive FFR. Ex vivo hearts from RyR2-S2814A mice also have blunted positive FFR, and cardiomyocytes isolated from the RyR2-S2814A mice exhibit impaired rate-dependent enhancement of cytosolic calcium levels and fractional shortening. The cardiac RyR2 macromolecular complexes isolated from murine and human failing hearts have reduced CaMKIIdelta levels. These data indicate that CaMKIIdelta phosphorylation of RyR2 plays an important role in mediating positive FFR in the heart, and that defective regulation of RyR2 by CaMKIIdelta-mediated phosphorylation is associated with the loss of positive FFR in failing hearts.",

Recently, the tumor suppressor p14(ARF) (ARF) has been shown to interact functionally with the nucleolar protein B23/NPM (B23) and inhibit rRNA biogenesis. However, the molecular basis of the ARF-B23 interaction is hitherto unclear. Here we show that a highly conserved motif in the B23 oligomerization domain is essential for mediating ARF binding in vivo. Mutagenesis of conserved B23 core residues (L102A, G105A, G107A) prevented B23 from interacting with ARF. Modeling of the B23 core indicated that substitutions in the GSGP loop motif could trigger conformational changes in B23 thereby obstructing ARF binding. Interestingly, the GSGP loop mutants were unstable, defective for oligomerization, and delocalized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. B23 core mutants displayed increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We conclude that the functional integrity of the B23 core motif is required for stability, efficient nucleolar localization as well as ARF binding.",

Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of Grb7 with the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 as well as the full-length receptor in intact cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb7 and requires tyrosine autophosphorylation of EphB1. Furthermore, Tyr-928 of EphB1 was identified as the primary binding site for Grb7. Stimulation of endogenous EphB1 in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells with its ligand ephrinB1 increased its association with Grb7, which is consistent with a role for the autophosphorylation of EphB1. We also found that EphB1 could phosphorylate Grb7 and mutation of either Tyr-928 or Tyr-594 to Phe decreased this activity. Finally, we show that EphB1 could stimulate fibroblast motility on extracellular matrix in a kinase-dependent manner, which also correlated with its association with Grb7. Consistent with this, co-expression of Grb7 with EphB1 further enhanced cell motility, whereas co-expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between EphB1 with the adaptor molecule Grb7 and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of cell migration by EphB1.",

The crystal structures of two arylsulfatases, ASA and ASB, and kinetic studies on ASA mutants led to different proposals for the catalytic mechanism in the hydrolysis of sulfate esters. The structures of two ASA mutants that lack the functional C(alpha)-formylglycine residue 69, in complex with a synthetic substrate, have been determined in order to unravel the reaction mechanism. The crystal structure of the inactive mutant C69A-ASA in complex with p-nitrocatechol sulfate (pNCS) mimics a reaction intermediate during sulfate ester hydrolysis by the active enzyme, without the covalent bond to the key side-chain FGly69. The structure shows that the side-chains of lysine 123, lysine 302, serine 150, histidine 229, the main-chain of the key residue 69 and the divalent cation in the active center are involved in sulfate binding. It is proposed that histidine 229 protonates the leaving alcoholate after hydrolysis.C69S-ASA is able to bind covalently to the substrate and hydrolyze it, but is unable to release the resulting sulfate. Nevertheless, the resulting sulfation is low. The structure of C69S-ASA shows the serine side-chain in a single conformation, turned away from the position a substrate occupies in the complex. This suggests that the double conformation observed in the structure of wild-type ASA is more likely to correspond to a formylglycine hydrate than to a twofold disordered aldehyde oxo group, and accounts for the relative inertness of the C69S-ASA mutant. In the C69S-ASA-pNCS complex, the substrate occupies the same position as in the C69A-ASA-pNCS complex, which corresponds to the non-covalently bonded substrate. Based on the structural data, a detailed mechanism for sulfate ester cleavage is proposed, involving an aldehyde hydrate as the functional group.",

In this report, we show that BCR engagement activates Rap1 and that this is dependent on production of diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C-gamma. Activation of Rap1 by the BCR was greatly reduced in phospholipase C-gamma-deficient B cells, whereas both a synthetic DAG and phorbol dibutyrate could activate Rap1 in B cells. We had previously shown that C3G, an activator of Rap1, associates with the Crk adaptor proteins in B cells and that BCR engagement causes Crk to bind to the Cas and Cbl docking proteins. However, the DAG-dependent pathway by which the BCR activates Rap1 apparently does not involve Crk signaling complexes since phorbol dibutyrate could activate Rap1 without inducing the formation of these complexes. Thus, the BCR activates Rap1 via a novel DAG-dependent pathway.",

The activated mTOR kinase phosphorylates/ activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and phosphorylates/inactivates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), resulting in the initiation of translation and cell-cycle progression. The prolactin receptor signaling cascade has been implicated in crosstalk with the mTOR pathway, but whether prolactin (PRL) directly activates mTOR is not known. This study showed that PRL stimulated the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, Akt, and Jak2 kinases in a dose- and time-dependent manner in PRL-dependent rat Nb2 lymphoma cells. PRL-stimulated phosphorylation of mTOR was detected as early as 10 min, closely following the phosphorylation of Akt (upstream of mTOR), but preceding that of the downstream p70S6K. PRL activation of mTOR was inhibited by rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor), LY249002, and wortmannin (P13K inhibitors), but not by AG490 (Jak2 inhibitor), indicating that it was mediated by the P13K/Akt, but not Jak2, pathway. PRL also stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in Nb2 cells. PRL-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 was inhibited by rapamycin, but not by okadaic acid (inhibitor of protein phosphatase, PP2A). PRL induced a transient interaction between p70S6K and the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) in 1 and 2 h, whereas a PP2Ac-4E-BP1 complex was constitutively present in quiescent and PRL-treated Nb2 cells. These results suggested that p70S6K and 4E-BP1 were substrates of PP2A and the inhibition of mTOR promoted their dephosphorylation by PP2A. In summary, PRL-stimulated phosphorylation of mTOR is mediated by PI3K. PRL-activated mTOR may phosphorylate p70S6K and 4E-BP1 by restraining PP2A.",

The most common mutation of the EGFR in glioblastomas is the deletion of exons 2-7 known as the EGFRvIII. This mutant receptor cannot bind EGF but, instead, is constitutively active. The Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases (Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c) targets the activated EGFR for degradation. As the EGFRvIII is transforming, we investigated whether it could be downregulated by the Cbl proteins. The overexpression of all three Cbl proteins resulted in the ubiquitination and degradation of the EGFRvIII. As with the wild-type EGFR, the TK-binding domain and the RING finger of Cbl-b are sufficient for the downregulation of the EGFRvIII. Also, we found that Cbl-b is recruited to the EGFRvIII and inhibits the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by the EGFRvIII. Mutation of the Cbl-binding site (Y1045F) in the EGFRvIII inhibits its ubiquitination and downregulation by Cbl-b and enhances its ability to transform. Furthermore, the EGFR TK inhibitor, AG 1478, prevents the downregulation of the EGFRvIII by the Cbl proteins and antagonizes the ability of an immunotoxin directed against the EGFRvIII to kill cells expressing this receptor. In conclusion, the EGFRvIII does not transform by escaping regulation by Cbl proteins and this activation-induced downregulation of the EGFRvIII has an important role in mediating the toxicity of anti-EGFRvIII immunotoxins.",

We show that individual mutation of five residues in the C-terminal calmodulin-binding domain of Env is sufficient to significantly reduce fas-mediated apoptosis in transfected cells. The A835W mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 eliminated co-immunoprecipitation of Env with calmodulin in studies with stably transfected cells. Four point mutations (A835W, A838W, A838I, and I842R) and the corresponding region of HIV-1 HXB2 were cloned into the HIV-1 proviral vector pNL4-3 with no significant effect on viral production or envelope expression, although co-immunoprecipitation of calmodulin and Env was decreased in three of these mutant viruses. Only wild-type envelope-containing virus induced significantly elevated levels of spontaneous apoptosis by day 5 post-infection. Fas-mediated apoptosis levels positively correlated with the degree of calmodulin co-immunoprecipitation, with the lowest apoptosis levels occurring in cells infected with the A835W envelope mutation. While spontaneous apoptosis appears to be at least partially calmodulin-independent, the effects of HIV-1 Env on fas-mediated apoptosis are directly related to calmodulin binding.",

Increased expression of Foxp1 enhanced Gpr132 transcription and caused cell cycle changes, including G2 arrest. Co-expression of wild-type Ikaros, but not IK6, displaced Foxp1 binding from the Gpr132 gene, reversed the increase in Gpr132 expression and inhibited G2 arrest.

This study investigated the molecular basis of LIF-induced augmentation of I(CaL) in rodent cardiomyocytes. LIF induced phosphorylation of a serine residue in the alpha(1c) subunit (Ca(v)1.2) of L-type Ca2+ channels in cultured rat cardiomyocytes, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059. When constructs encoding either a wild-type or a carboxyl-terminal-truncated rabbit Ca(v)1.2 subunit were transfected into HEK293 cells, LIF induced phosphorylation of the resultant wild-type protein but not the mutant protein. Cotransfection of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase also resulted in phosphorylation of the Ca(v)1.2 subunit in the absence of LIF stimulation. In in-gel kinase assays, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylated a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the carboxyl-terminal region of Ca(v)1.2 (residues 1700 through 1923), which contains the consensus sequence Pro-Leu-Ser-Pro. A point mutation within this consensus sequence, which results in a substitution of alanine for serine at residue 1829 (S1829A), was sufficient to abolish the LIF-induced phosphorylation. LIF increased I(CaL) in HEK cells transfected with wild-type Ca(v)1.2 but not with the mutated version.

In solid phase assays, xCAL 3-6a inhibited the binding of LPL to both heparan sulfate and heparin. XCAL 3-6a did not inhibit the catalytic activity of the avian enzyme. The monoclonal antibody was not found to cross-react significantly with bovine lipoprotein lipase. In order to determine the location of the epitope of xCAL 3-6a on lipoprotein lipase, several avian lipoprotein lipase deletion mutants were constructed and produced as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in E. coli. These mutants were screened for their ability to react with xCAL 3-6a using Western blotting. The minimum continuous fragment of lipoprotein lipase that was required for reactivity contained the amino acids 310 to 450. Site-directed mutagenesis of basic residues 321, 405, 407, 409, 415, and 416 revealed that Arg 405 is necessary for the interaction of LPL with xCAL 3-6a.

To gain insight into the structural basis of the regulation of RyR2 by PKA, we determined the three-dimensional location of the PKA site Ser2030. GFP (green fluorescent protein) was inserted into RyR2-wt (wild-type RyR2)and RyR2 mutant, A4860G, after Thr2023. The resultant GFP-RyR2 fusion proteins, RyR2T2023-GFP and RyR2(A4860G)T2023-GFP, were expressed in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells and functionally characterized. Ca2+-release assays revealed that both GFP-RyR2 fusion proteins formed caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+-release channels. Further analyses using[3H]ryanodine binding demonstrated that the insertion of GFPinto RyR2-wt after Thr2023 reduced the sensitivity of the channelto activation by Ca2+ or caffeine. RyR2(A4860G)T2023-GFP was found to be structurally more stable than RyR2T2023-GFP and was subsequently used as a basis for three-dimensional reconstruction.

Distinct from traditional ABC transporters, ABCC9-encoded sulfonylurea receptors (SUR2A) form, with Kir6.2 potassium channels, ATP-sensitive K+ (K ATP) channel complexes. SUR2A contains ATPase activity harbored within NBD2 and, to a lesser degree, NBD1, with catalytically driven conformations exerting determinate linkage on the Kir6.2 channel pore. While homodomain interactions typify NBDs of conventional ABC transporters, heterodomain NBD interactions and their functional consequence have not been resolved for the atypical SUR2A protein. Here, nanoscale protein topography mapped assembly of monodisperse purified recombinant SUR2A NBD1/NBD2 domains, precharacterized by dynamic light scattering. Heterodomain interaction produced conformational rearrangements inferred by secondary structural change in circular dichroism, and validated by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy. Physical engagement of NBD1 with NBD2 translated into enhanced intrinsic ATPase activity. Molecular modeling delineated a complemental asymmetry of NBD1/NBD2 ATP-binding sites. Mutation in the predicted catalytic base residue, D834E of NBD1, altered NBD1 ATPase activity disrupting potentiation of catalytic behavior in the NBD1/NBD2 interactome. Thus, NBD1/NBD2 assembly, resolved by a panel of proteomic approaches, provides a molecular substrate that determines the optimal catalytic activity in SUR2A, establishing a paradigm for the structure-function relationship within the K ATP channel complex.",

In addition, strains of HVS subgroup C are able to transform T cells of Old World primates, including humans, to permanently growing T-cell lines. In concert with the Stp oncoprotein, the tyrosine kinase-interacting protein (Tip) of HVS C488 is required for T-cell transformation in vitro and lymphoma induction in vivo. Tip was previously shown to interact with the protein tyrosine kinase Lck. Constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) has been associated with oncogenesis and has also been detected in HVS-transformed T-cell lines. Furthermore, Tip contains a putative consensus YXPQ binding motif for the SH2 (src homology 2) domains of STAT1 and STAT3. Tip tyrosine phosphorylation at this site was required for binding of STATs and induction of STAT-dependent transcription. Here we sought to address the relevance of STAT activation for transformation of human T cells by introducing a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation in the YXPQ motif of Tip of HVS C488. Unexpectedly, the recombinant virus was still able to transform human T lymphocytes, but it had lost its capability to activate STAT3 as well as STAT1. This demonstrates that growth transformation by HVS is independent of STAT3 activation.",

          "text": "Signalling by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) has been studied intensively, but for most cell types the analysis is complicated by the fact that EGFR not only homodimerizes but can also form heterodimers with other EGFR family members. Heterodimerization is a particular problem in the study of EGFR mutants, where the true phenotype of the mutants is confounded by the contribution of the heterodimer partner to signal transduction. We have made use of the murine hemopoietic cell line BaF/3, which does not express EGFR family members, to express wild-type (WT) EGFR, three kinase-defective EGFR mutants (V741G, Y740F, and K721R), or a C-terminally truncated EGFR (CT957) and have measured their responses to EGF. We found that under the appropriate conditions EGF can stimulate cell proliferation of BaF/3 cells expressing WT or CT957 EGFRs but not that of cells expressing the kinase-defective mutants. However, EGF promotes the survival of BaF/3 cells expressing either of the kinase-defective receptors (V741G and Y740F), indicating that these receptors can still transmit a survival signal. Analysis of the early signalling events by the WT, V741G, and Y740F mutant EGF receptors indicated that EGF stimulates comparable levels of Shc phosphorylation, Shc-GRB-2 association, and activation of Ras, B-Raf, and Erk-1. Blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway with the specific inhibitor PD98059 abrogates completely the EGF-dependent survival of cells expressing the kinase-defective EGFR mutants but has no effect on the EGF-dependent proliferation mediated by WT and CT957 EGFRs. Similarly, the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 abrogates EGF-dependent survival without affecting proliferation. However blocking phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase or JAK-2 kinase with specific inhibitors does arrest growth factor-dependent cell proliferation. Thus, EGFR-mediated mitogenic signalling in BaF/3 cells requires an intact EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and appears to depend on the activation of both the JAK-2 and PI-3 kinase pathways. Activation of the Src family of kinases or of the Ras/MAPK pathway can, however, be initiated by a kinase-impaired EGFR and is linked to survival.",

Here we investigated the role of tyrosine 1212 on mouse VEGFR-2 autophosphorylation and its signal transduction relay in endothelial cells. Mutation of tyrosine 1212 on VEGFR-2 to phenylalanine severely impaired the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and its ability to associate with and activate Src. This mutation also reduced the VEGFR-2 ability to phosphorylate phospholipase Cgamma1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Unlike mutation of tyrosine 1212 to phenylalanine, replacement of tyrosine 1212 with glutamic acid preserved the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 and activation of VEGFR-2-associated signaling proteins including Src, phospholipase Cgamma1, and MAPK. Further analysis showed that Src activation is not required for activation of VEGFR-2, since cells co-expressing wild type receptor with kinase dead Src or wild type Src displayed no apparent effect in the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Similarly, expression of wild type VEGFR-2 in fibroblast (SYF) cells obtained from the triple knockout Src family kinases showed normal ligand-dependent autophosphorylation. Collectively, these results suggest that phosphorylation of tyrosine 1212 of VEGFR-2 plays a crucial role in the activation of VEGFR-2 and subsequently VEGFR-2-mediated angiogenesis.",

Although the participation of PIG3 in the apoptotic pathway is proven, the protein and its mechanism of action were never characterized. We analyzed human PIG3 enzymatic function and found NADPH-dependent reductase activity with ortho-quinones, which is consistent with the classification of PIG3 in the quinone oxidoreductase family. However, the activity is much lower than that of zeta-crystallin, a better known quinone oxidoreductase. In addition, we report the crystallographic structure of PIG3, which allowed the identification of substrate- and cofactor-binding sites, with residues fully conserved from bacteria to human. Tyr-59 in zeta-crystallin (Tyr-51 in PIG3) was suggested to participate in the catalysis of quinone reduction. However, kinetics of Tyr/Phe and Tyr/Ala mutants of both enzymes demonstrated that the active site Tyr is not catalytic but may participate in substrate binding, consistent with a mechanism based on propinquity effects. It has been proposed that PIG3 contribution to apoptosis would be through oxidative stress generation. We found that in vitro activity and in vivo overexpression of PIG3 accumulate reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, an inactive PIG3 mutant (S151V) did not produce reactive oxygen species in cells, indicating that enzymatically active protein is necessary for this function. This supports that PIG3 action is through oxidative stress produced by its enzymatic activity and provides essential knowledge for eventual control of apoptosis.",

In the present study, we report that LEDGF is constitutively Sumoylated, and that the dynamical regulatory mechanism(s) (i.e. Sumoylation and deSumoylation) act as a molecular switch in modulating the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of LEDGF with the functional consequences. Using bioinformatics analysis coupled with in vitro and in vivo Sumoylation assays, we found that lysine (K) 364 of LEDGF was Sumoylated, repressing its transcriptional activity. Conversely, mutation of K364 to arginine (R) or deSumoylation by small ubiquitin-like modifier (Sumo)-specific protease-1, a nuclear deSumoylase, enhanced the transactivation capacity of LEDGF and its cellular abundance. The enhancements were directly correlated with an increase in the DNA-binding activity and small heat shock protein transcription of LEDGF, whereas the process was reversed in cells overexpressing Sumo1. Interestingly, cells expressing Sumoylation-deficient pEGFP-K364R protein showed increased cellular survival compared to wild-type LEDGF protein. The findings provide insights into the regulation and regulatory functions of LEDGF in Sumoylation-dependent transcriptional control that may be essential for modifying the physiology of cells to maintain cellular homeostasis.

IQGAP1 is a scaffolding protein with the ability to regulate cytoskeletal organization. It is hypothesized that IQGAP1 contributes to actin reorganization in podocytes through interaction with nephrin. IQGAP1 expression and IQGAP1-nephrin colocalization in glomeruli were progressively decreased and then gradually recovered in line with the development of foot process fusion and proteinuria in puromycin aminonucleoside-injected rats. In cultured human podocytes, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced disruption of F-actin and disorders of migration and spreading were aggravated by IQGAP1 siRNA, and these effects were partially restored by a wild-type IQGAP1 plasmid. Furthermore, the cytoskeletal disorganization stimulated by cytochalasin D in COS7 cells was recovered by cotransfection with wild-type IQGAP1 and nephrin plasmids but was not recovered either by single transfection of the wild-type IQGAP1 plasmid or by cotransfection of mutant IQGAP1 [\u25b31443(S\u2192A)] and wild-type nephrin plasmids.

Using an in vitro competition/association assay, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 alone, Cdk4 alone and/or cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes do not compete for the p57Kip2 homodimers formation. However, a mutation in the alpha-helix domain of p57Kip2 (R33L) strongly reduced homodimer formation but did not modify interaction with cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes. Also, increasing amounts of p57Kip2 lead in vivo to a significant augmentation in the level of p57Kip2 homodimerization associated with cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes and to a marked inhibition of the cyclin D1-Cdk4 kinase activity. Altogether, these data suggest a model whereby p57Kip2 associates with itself by using the NH2 domain to form a homodimeric species which interacts with and inhibits the cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes.",

The aim of this study was to determine the structure of the dominant negative G\u03b1i1\u03b21\u03b32 G203A/A326S complex (Gi-DN) and to reveal the structural basis of the mutation-induced phenotype of G\u03b1i1\u03b21\u03b32. METHODS: The three subunits of the Gi-DN complex were co-expressed with a baculovirus expression system. The Gi-DN heterotrimer was purified, and the structure of its complex with GDP was determined through X-ray crystallography. RESULTS: The Gi-DN heterotrimer structure revealed a dual mechanism underlying the dominant negative characteristics. The mutations weakened the hydrogen bonding network between GDP/GTP and the binding pocket residues, and increased the interactions in the G\u03b1-G\u03b2\u03b3 interface. Concomitantly, the Gi-DN heterotrimer adopted a conformation, in which the C-terminus of G\u03b1i and the N-termini of both the G\u03b2 and G\u03b3 subunits were more similar to the GPCR-bound state compared with the wild type complex. From these structural observations, two additional mutations (T48F and D272F) were designed that completely abolish the GDP binding of the Gi-DN heterotrimer. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results suggest that the mutations impede guanine nucleotide binding and G\u03b1-G\u03b2\u03b3 protein dissociation and favor the formation of the G protein/GPCR complex, thus blocking signal propagation. In addition, the structure provides a rationale for the design of other mutations that cause dominant negative effects in the G protein, as exemplified by the T48F and D272F mutations.",

We have previously reported isolation of a protein kinase from yeast extracts that phosphorylates Srp1p complexed with NLS peptides/proteins. From partial amino acid sequences of the four subunits of the purified kinase, we have now identified this protein kinase to be identical to yeast casein kinase II (CKII). It was previously thought that autophosphorylation of the 36 kDa subunit of the yeast enzyme was stimulated by the substrate, GST-Srp1p. However, with the use of a more refined system, no stimulation of autophosphorylation of the 36 kDa subunit of yeast CKII was observed. Biochemical and mutational analyses localized the in vitro phosphorylation site of Srp1p by CKII to serine 67. It was shown that, in the absence of NLS peptides/proteins, phosphorylation of the intact Srp1p protein is very weak, but deletion of the C-terminal end causes great stimulation of phosphorylation without NLS peptides/proteins. Thus, the CKII phosphorylation site is apparently masked in the intact protein structure by the presence of a C-terminal region, probably between amino acids 403 and 516. Binding of NLS peptides/proteins most likely causes a change in protein conformation, exposing the CKII phosphorylation site. Mutational alterations of serine 67, the CKII phosphorylation site, to valine (S67V) and aspartic acid (S67D) were not found to cause any significant deleterious effects on cell growth. Analysis of in vivo phosphorylation showed that at least 30% of the wild type Srp1p molecules are phosphorylated in growing cells, and that the phosphorylation is mostly at the serine 67 CKII site. The ability of Srp1p purified from E coli and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to bind a SV40 T-antigen NLS peptide was compared with that of Srp1p which was almost fully phosphorylated by CKII. No significant difference was observed. It appears that NLS binding does not require any phosphorylation of Srp1p, either by CKII or by some other protein kinase.",

The purified Bad (wild-type)-DTTR protein showed cytotoxicity to human glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Bad phosphorylation sites at codons 112 and 136 were mutated from serine to alanine to prevent Bad inactivation by kinases and to increase the toxicity of Bad. The Bad (S112A S136A)-DTTR protein was at least 5 times more toxic than Bad (wild-type)-DTTR with an IC(50) of 5 x 10(-8) M. The Bad (S112A S136A)-DTTR protein altered the subcellular distribution of Bcl-X(L), indicating that it enters the cell cytoplasm and binds Bcl-X(L). Bad (S112D S136A)-DTTR, mutated to mimic phosphorylation of Bad, showed lower toxicity than either Bad (wild-type)-DTTR or Bad (S112A S136A)-DTTR, additionally indicating that Bad-DTTR must bind Bcl-X(L) to stimulate apoptosis.

The screening of the p27(Kip1) sequence identified many potential phosphorylation sites. To investigate the effects of the overexpression of exogenous p27(Kip1) protein lacking the Thr157 sites on subcellular localization, cell cycle, and proliferation, a plasmid was constructed containing mutations of p27(Kip1) at Thr157 (T157A p27), and transfected into the SMMC7721 cell line with Lipofectamine. Wild-type and mutant p27 plasmids T157A were transfected separately as control groups. METHODS: We detected the proliferation of SMMC7721 cells by the Cell Counting Kit and FACS/Calibur Flow Cytometer and analyzed the expression and localization of p27(Kip1) by Western blotting analysis and cell fractionation. The cdk2 dependent kinase activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay. RESULTS: Proliferation of SMMC7721 cells was greatly inhibited and cell cycle was arrested in G(0/1) phase after exogenous p27(Kip1) mutant expression much more than wild-type p27(Kip1). The expressed T157A p27(Kip1) proteins were translocated from the cytoplasm into nucleus much more compare with wild-type. Compared with pcDNA3.1-Myc control, transient transfection of T157A p27(Kip1) decreased expression of cyclin D1 and the phosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the potential effectiveness of a PI3K/Akt-resistant phosphorylated form of p27 in hepatocellular carcinoma gene therapy.",

Stimulation of the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer line as well as mouse mammary glands with epidermal growth factor results in the co-immunoprecipitation of MUC1 with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of approximately 180 kDa. We have generated transgenic lines overexpressing full-length (MMF), cytoplasmic tail deleted (DeltaCT), or tandem repeat deleted (DeltaTR)-human MUC1 under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter to further examine the role of MUC1 in signaling and tumorigenesis. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that full-length transgenic MUC1 physically associates with all four erbB receptors, and co-localizes with erbB1 in the lactating gland. Furthermore, we detected a sharp increase in ERK1/2 activation in MUC1 transgenic mammary glands compared with Muc1 null and wild-type animals. These results point to a novel function of increased MUC1 expression, potentiation of erbB signaling through the activation of mitogenic MAP kinase pathways.",

Transient small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of LEDGF/p75 in HeLaP4 cells resulted in a three- to fivefold inhibition of HIV-1 (strain NL4.3) replication. Quantitative PCR was used to pinpoint the replication block to the integration step. Next, polyclonal and monoclonal HeLaP4-derived cell lines were selected with a stable knockdown of LEDGF/p75 mediated by a lentiviral vector (lentivector) encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting this protein. Cell lines stably transduced with a lentivector encoding an unrelated hairpin or a double-mismatch hairpin served as controls. Again, a two- to fourfold reduction of HIV-1 replication was observed. The extent of LEDGF/p75 knockdown closely correlated with the reduction of HIV-1 replication. After the back-complementation of LEDGF/p75 in the poly- and monoclonal knockdown cell lines using an shRNA-resistant expression plasmid, viral replication was restored to nearly wild-type levels. The Q168A mutation in integrase has been shown to interfere with the interaction with LEDGF/p75 without reducing the enzymatic activity. Transduction by HIV-1-derived lentivectors carrying the Q168A IN mutant was severely hampered, pointing again to a requirement for LEDGF/p75. Altogether, our data validate LEDGF/p75 as an important cellular cofactor for HIV integration and as a potential target for antiviral drug development.",

Surprisingly, this reaction required only ATP binding, not hydrolysis.

How this phosphorylation regulates the activity of VDAC1, however, has not yet been reported.

Wild-type VDAC1 assumes an open configuration, but closes and prevents cytochrome c efflux when phosphorylated by Nek1. A VDAC1-Ser193Ala mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by Nek1 under identical conditions, remains open and constitutively allows cytochrome c efflux.

A double mutation of two proline residues to alanine residues in the \u03b1IIb cytoplasmic domain, previously shown to disturb its conformation, inhibits chimeric \u03b1V/\u03b1IIb\u03b23-CIB interaction. This demonstrates that \u03b1IIb cytoplasmic domain loop-like conformation is required for interaction with CIB. Moreover, mutations of \u03b23 cytoplasmic domain residues Tyr-747 and/or Tyr-759 to phenylalanine residues (Y747F, Y759F, and Y747,759F) as well as residues Ser-752 to proline or alanine (S752P and S752A), do not affect the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 or \u03b1V\u03b23 interaction with CIB.

Likewise, ablation of conformation-dependent affinity change in \u03b23 Ser752Pro mutation had no affect on CIB-\u03b23 interaction. In summary, our results demonstrate that the \u03b1IIb-subunit integrin and CIB interaction is non-exclusive and requires the loop-like \u03b1IIb-cytoplasmic domain conformation. An interaction of CIB with \u03b1V-containing integrins provides an additional role for this molecule in keeping with its expression outside of platelets.",

Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin. These results are relevant for other proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily and provide useful clues for structure-based drug design.",

          "text": "Previous studies have shown that the apoptotic response of cells following DNA damage requires p53 expression. Wild-type p53 protein levels increase in response to DNA damage and its growth-suppressive action is thought to be mediated by transcriptional activation of the p21/WAF1/CIP1 gene, the product of which is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. The mechanism by which elevated p53 levels lead to apoptosis is not known, but is believed to involve transcriptional activation of apoptotic genes, such as BAX. We have studied transformed human cells that constitutively express high levels of the R273H mutant p53, which has been reported to lack transcriptional activation activity. We used the inability to induce the p21/Waf1/Cip1 protein as a marker to verify the lack of transcriptional activation activity. Cells expressing the R273H mutant of p53 do not show an increase in p21/Waf1/Cip1 following irradiation with ionizing or UVB radiation. Surprisingly, these cells are very susceptible to induction of apoptosis by UVB radiation, as seen by the formation of a nucleosomal ladder and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This suggests that the R273 mutant p53 can function normally in apoptosis but not in transcriptional activation following DNA damage. Furthermore, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II is a potent inducer of apoptosis in these cells, demonstrating that transcription is not required for apoptosis and suggesting that stalled RNA polymerase II complexes can initiate apoptosis. Interestingly, proteolytic cleavage of p53 occurs during apoptosis in these cells, generating a 45-kDa fragment and liberating the DNA repair helicase binding domain of p53. We propose that the peptide liberated from the carboxy terminus of p53 may contribute to its apoptotic activity, possibly through interaction with the XPB and XPD DNA helicases.",

We treated three human prostate cancer cell lines with etoposide, a toposiomerase II inhibitor with activity against various tumors including prostate cancer. We found that the overexpression of FADD sensitizes etoposide-induced apoptosis through a rapid activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and, subsequently, of caspase 3. In addition, phosphorylation of FADD at serine 194 coincided with this sensitization. Treatment with the caspase 3 inhibitor, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO), or overexpression of either mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) 7 or Bcl-xL canceled FADD-mediated sensitization to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the caspase 8 inhibitor, benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-IETD-fmk), or overexpression of viral FLICE/caspase-8-inhibitory protein (FLIP) from equine herpesvirus type 2 E8 also had an inhibitory effect, supporting a major involvement of a caspase 8-dependent mitochondrial pathway. Interestingly, FADD was phosphorylated, and etoposide-induced JNK/caspase activation and apoptosis were enhanced in the cells arrested at G2/M transition, but not in those overexpressing mutant FADD, in which 194 serine was replaced by alanine. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylated FADD-dependent activation of the JNK/caspase pathway plays a pivotal role in sensitization to etoposide-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.",

This phosphorylation occurs transiently during unperturbed mitosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of MST2 does not affect its kinase activity or Hippo-YAP signaling.

Binding to both PDGF alpha-and beta-receptors was inhibited by the conversion of all three cationic residues into anionic glutamates (RKK-->EEE), whereas an RKK-->SSS mutant also exhibited a modest loss in affinity for beta-receptors. Replacements with serine at either Arg160 (RKK-->SKK) or at all three positions (RKK-->SSS) had little effect on binding to alpha-receptors. Replacements with either glutamic or serine residues at any of the three positions also resulted in significant inhibition of heparin-binding activity. Furthermore, the RKK-->EEE mutant exhibited decreased association with the cell surface and accumulated in the culture medium as 29-32 kDa forms. Stable transfection of U87 astrocytoma cells with RKK-->EEE mutants of either the A-chain or the B-chain inhibited malignant growth in athymic nude mice. Despite altered receptor-binding activities, each of the loop III mutants retained full mitogenic activity when applied to cultured Swiss 3T3 cells. CD spectrophotometric analysis of the RKK-->EEE mutant revealed a secondary structure indistinguishable from the wild type, with a high degree of beta-sheet structure and random coil content (50% and 43% respectively). These findings indicate an important role of the Arg160-Lys161-Lys162 sequence in mediating the biological and cell-associative activities of the PDGF-BB homodimer, and reveal that the mitogenic activity of PDGF-BB is insufficient to mediate its full oncogenic properties.",

In a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult rat brain cDNA library with the CTDs of mGluR8a and 8b (mGluR8-C) as baits, we identified sumo1 and four different components of the sumoylation cascade (ube2a, Pias1, Piasgamma, Piasxbeta) as interacting proteins. Binding assays using recombinant GST fusion proteins confirmed that Pias1 interacts not only with mGluR8-C but also with all group III mGluR CTDs. Pias1 binding to mGluR8-C required a region N-terminal to a consensus sumoylation motif and was not affected by arginine substitution of the conserved lysine 882 within this motif. Co-transfection of fluorescently tagged mGluR8a-C, sumo1, and enzymes of the sumoylation cascade into HEK293 cells showed that mGluR8a-C can be sumoylated in vivo. Arginine substitution of lysine 882 within the consensus sumoylation motif, but not other conserved lysines within the CTD, abolished in vivo sumoylation. Our results are consistent with post-translational sumoylation providing a novel mechanism of group III mGluR regulation.",

Partial modification of (263)NGR to DGR or iso-DGR was detected in purified plasma FN by mass spectrometry. To test functions of the conversion, one or both NGR sequences were mutated to QGR in recombinant N-terminal 70-kDa construct of FN (70K), full-length FN, or FN-RGE. The mutations did not affect the binding of soluble 70K to already adherent fibroblasts or the ability of soluble 70K to compete with non-mutant FN or FN-RGE for binding to FN assembly sites.

Oligonucleotide selection-amplification revealed that a variety of bHLH-PAS protein combinations could interact, with each generating a unique DNA binding specificity. To validate the selection-amplification protocol, we demonstrated the preference of the AHR.ARNT complex for the sequence commonly found in dioxin-responsive enhancers in vivo (TNGCGTG). We then demonstrated that the ARNT protein is capable of forming a homodimer with a binding preference for the palindromic E-box sequence, CACGTG. Further examination indicated that ARNT may have a relaxed partner specificity, since it was also capable of forming a heterodimer with SIM and recognizing the sequence GT(G/A)CGTG. Coprecipitation experiments using various PAS proteins and ARNT were consistent with the idea that the ARNT protein has a broad range of interactions among the bHLH-PAS proteins, while the other members appear more restricted in their interactions. Comparison of this in vitro data with sites known to be bound in vivo suggests that the high affinity half-site recognition sequences for the AHR, SIM, and ARNT are T(C/T)GC, GT(G/A)C (5'-half-sites), and GTG (3'-half-sites), respectively.",

DAT function is acutely modulated by dynamic membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and a PKC-sensitive negative endocytic mechanism, or \"endocytic brake,\" controls DAT plasma membrane stability. However, the molecular basis for the DAT endocytic brake is unknown, and it is unknown whether this braking mechanism is unique to DAT or common to monoamine transporters. Here, we report that the cdc42-activated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1, is a DAT endocytic brake that stabilizes DAT at the plasma membrane and is released in response to PKC activation. Pharmacologic and shRNA-mediated Ack1 silencing enhanced basal DAT internalization and blocked PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, but had no effects on SERT endocytosis. Both cdc42 activation and PKC stimulation converge on Ack1 to control Ack1 activity and DAT endocytic capacity, and Ack1 inactivation is required for stimulated DAT internalization downstream of PKC activation. Moreover, constitutive Ack1 activation is sufficient to rescue the gain-of-function endocytic phenotype exhibited by the ADHD DAT coding variant, R615C. These findings reveal a unique endocytic control switch that is highly specific for DAT. Moreover, the ability to rescue the DAT(R615C) coding variant suggests that manipulating DAT trafficking mechanisms may be a potential therapeutic approach to correct DAT coding variants that exhibit trafficking dysregulation.",

Although the hMLH1 protein has been found to copurify with another MMR protein hPMS2 as a heterodimer, their function in MMR is unknown. In this study, we have identified the physical interaction regions of both hMLH1 with hPMS2. We then examined the effects of hMLH1 missense alterations found in HNPCC kindreds for their interaction with hPMS2. Four of these missense alterations (L574P, K616Delta, R659P, and A681T) displayed >95% reduction in binding to hPMS2. Two additional missense alterations (K618A and K618T) displayed a >85% reduction in binding to hPMS2, whereas three missense alterations (S44F, V506A, and E578G) displayed 25-65% reduction in binding to hPMS2. Interestingly, two HNPCC missense alterations (Q542L and L582V) contained within the consensus interaction region displayed no effect on interaction with hPMS2, suggesting that they may affect other functions of hMLH1. These data confirm that functional deficiencies in the interaction of hMLH1 with hPMS2 are associated with HNPCC as well as suggest that other unknown functional alteration of the human MutL homologues may lead to tumorigenesis in HNPCC kindreds.",

Here we investigated the functional effects of these variants on COL1A1 transcription. Transcription was 2-fold higher with the osteoporosis-associated G-del-T haplotype compared with the common G-Ins-G haplotype. Gel shift assays showed that the region surrounding the -1663IndelT polymorphism recognized a complex of proteins essential for osteoblast differentiation and function including Nmp4 and Osterix, and the osteoporosis-associated -1663delT allele had increased binding affinity for this complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that the region flanking -1663insdelT bound a complex of proteins including Osterix and Nmp4 and also showed evidence of recruitment of Nmp4 to the Sp1 binding site in intron 1. Further studies showed that haplotype G-del-T had higher binding affinity for RNA polymerase II, consistent with increased transcription of the G-del-T allele and there was a significant inverse association between carriage of G-del-T and bone mineral density (BMD) in a cohort of 3270 Caucasian women. We conclude that common polymorphic variants in the 5' flank of COLIA1 regulate transcription by affecting DNA-protein interactions and that increased levels of transcription correlate with reduced BMD values in vivo. This is consistent with a model whereby increased COL1A1 transcription predisposes to osteoporosis, probably by increasing production of the alpha 1 chain and disrupting the normal ratio of collagen type 1 alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains.",

In EGF-treated cells, Tks4 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with the activated EGF receptor. This association is not direct but requires the presence of Src tyrosine kinase. In addition, treatment of cells with LY294002, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, or mutations of the PX domain reduces tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane translocation of Tks4. Furthermore, a PX domain mutant (R43W) Tks4 carrying a reported point mutation in a Frank-ter Haar syndrome patient showed aberrant intracellular expression and reduced phosphoinositide binding. Finally, silencing of Tks4 was shown to markedly inhibit HeLa cell migration in a Boyden chamber assay in response to EGF or serum.

Here, we investigated the role of fibronectin (FN), a major ECM protein, on the functions of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). We observed that FN, the ligand for integrin alpha5beta1, selectively promoted the growth of LEC as compared with vitronectin (VN) in the presence of the ligand for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 [VEGFR-3 (VEGF-C156S)]. Upon investigating the mechanisms whereby ECM components regulate VEGFR-3 signaling, we found that FN transactivated VEGFR-3 and significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 induced by VEGF-C156S as compared to VN. An enhanced association of the integrin subunit alpha5 or beta1 with VEGFR-3, after stimulation with VEGF-C156S, was observed by co-immunoprecipitation. While blockade of integrin alpha5beta1 inhibited the VEGF-C156S-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3, no similar effect was obtained by blocking integrin alphavbeta3. FN also protected the endothelial cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Moreover, while the specific PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, abolished this FN-mediated cell survival, the MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD98059, had no significant effect. Furthermore, a dominant-negative mutant of VEGFR-3 (G857R) reduced VEGF-C156S or FN-mediated cell survival, as well as the activities of PI3 kinase/Akt. Our results indicate that integrin alpha5beta1 participates in the activation of both VEGFR-3 and its downstream PI3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway, which is essential for FN-mediated lymphatic endothelial cell survival and proliferation.",

As expected, cells lacking S100B (LOX-IM VI) were not affected by siRNA(S100B), and introduction of S100B reduced their UV-induced apoptosis activity by 7-fold, further demonstrating that S100B inhibits apoptosis activities in p53-containing cells.

In summary, reducing S100B expression with siRNA was sufficient to activate p53, its transcriptional activation activities, and p53-dependent apoptosis pathway(s) in melanoma involving the Fas death receptor and perhaps PIDD.

This interaction functionally interconnects these two hitherto unrelated peroxins. Pex15p provides the mechanistic basis for the reversible targeting of Pex6p to peroxisomal membranes. We could demonstrate that the N-terminal part of Pex6p contains the binding site for Pex15p and that the two AAA cassettes D1 and D2 of Pex6p have opposite effects on this interaction. A point mutation in the Walker A motif of D1 (K489A) decreased the binding of Pex6p to Pex15p indicating that the interaction of Pex6p with Pex15p required binding of ATP. Mutations in Walker A (K778A) and B (D831Q) motifs of D2 abolished growth on oleate and led to a considerable larger fraction of peroxisome bound Pex6p. The nature of these mutations suggested that ATP-hydrolysis is required to disconnect Pex6p from Pex15p. On the basis of these results, we propose that Pex6p exerts at least part of its function by an ATP-dependent cycle of recruitment and release to and from Pex15p.",

We identified a single phosphorylated amino acid residue in the DYRK substrate histone H3 (threonine 45) by mass spectrometry, phosphoamino acid analysis, and protein sequencing. Exchange of threonine 45 for alanine abolished phosphorylation of histone H3 by DYRK1A and by the related kinases DYRK1B, DYRK2, and DYRK3 but not by CLK3. In order to define the consensus sequence for the substrate specificity of DYRK1A, a library of 300 peptides was designed in variation of the H3 phosphorylation site. Evaluation of the phosphate incorporation into these peptides identified DYRK1A as a proline-directed kinase with a phosphorylation consensus sequence (RPX(S/T)P) similar to that of ERK2 (PX(S/T)P). A peptide designed after the optimal substrate sequence (DYRKtide) was efficiently phosphorylated by DYRK1A (K(m) = 35 microM) but not by ERK2. Both ERK2 and DYRK1A phosphorylated myelin basic protein, whereas only ERK2, but not DYRK1A, phosphorylated the mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate ELK-1. This marked difference in substrate specificity between DYRK1A and ERK2 can be explained by the requirement for an arginine at the P -3 site of DYRK substrates and its presumed interaction with aspartate 247 conserved in all DYRKs.",

          "text": "At the junction of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle in cellular metabolism, the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDHc) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In mammals, PDHc is tightly regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of three serine residues in the thiamin-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. In vivo, inactivation of human PDHc correlates mostly with phosphorylation of serine 264, which is located at the entrance of the substrate channel leading to the active site of E1. Despite intense investigations, the molecular mechanism of this inactivation has remained enigmatic. Here, a detailed analysis of microscopic steps of catalysis in human wild-type PDHc-E1 and pseudophosphorylation variant Ser264Glu elucidates how phosphorylation of Ser264 affects catalysis. Whereas the intrinsic reactivity of the active site in catalysis of pyruvate decarboxylation remains nearly unaltered, the preceding binding of substrate to the enzyme's active site via the substrate channel and the subsequent reductive acetylation of the E2 component are severely slowed in the phosphorylation variant. The structure of pseudophosphorylation variant Ser264Glu determined by X-ray crystallography reveals no differences in the three-dimensional architecture of the phosphorylation loop or of the active site, when compared to those of the wild-type enzyme. However, the channel leading to the active site is partially obstructed by the side chain of residue 264 in the variant. By analogy, a similar obstruction of the substrate channel can be anticipated to result from a phosphorylation of Ser264. The kinetic and thermodynamic results in conjunction with the structure of Ser264Glu suggest that phosphorylation blocks access to the active site by imposing a steric and electrostatic barrier for substrate binding and active site coupling with the E2 component. As a Ser264Gln variant, which carries no charge at position 264, is also selectively deficient in pyruvate binding and reductive acetylation of E2, we conclude that mostly steric effects account for inhibition of PDHc by phosphorylation.",

This cell system was developed previously as a model for lung adenocarcinoma by overexpression of c-erbB-2 in nontumorigenic, T antigen-immortalized HBECs. Earlier studies demonstrated that a tumorigenic clone from T antigen-immortalized nontumorigenic cells overexpressing ErbB-2 endogenously produced high levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and that reducing TGF-alpha by 93% eliminated tumorigenicity. In the present report, comparison of ErbB species between the tumorigenic cells (E6T) and their nontumorigenic derivatives (E6TA) demonstrated all four receptors in both cell types. However, in E6TA cells, ErbB-3 and -4 were present primarily in ErbB-1 heterodimers, suggesting that ErbB-1 is a preferred heterodimer partner within this cell system, expressing endogenous ErbB receptors and ligands and overexpressing ErbB-2. The ErbB-1/-2 species was present at high levels in E6T and absent in E6TA cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was elevated in E6T relative to E6TA. Elevated activity was eliminated by blocking surface expression of either ErbB-1 or ErbB-2. Endoplasmic reticulum trapping of ErbB-1 eliminated tumorigenicity, whereas ErbB-2 internalization was selected against during tumor formation. These data demonstrate the importance of TGF-alpha-mediated signaling through the ErbB-1/-2 heterodimer in development of the tumorigenic phenotype. This work further suggests that ErbB-3 and -4 species may also contribute to tumorigenic conversion and that their expression levels may be increased by signaling initiated by TGF-alpha.",

Here, we mapped Y921TNL within the C-terminal domain of Fms as a novel autophosphorylation site. We demonstrate that this site constitutes a second Grb2 binding site: a recombinant fusion protein (residues 904-944) containing phosphorylated Y921 bound Grb2 from FDCP-1Mac11 cell extracts significantly more efficiently than a corresponding protein (residues 617-759) containing Y696. A yeast two-hybrid system which allowed the formation of a functional Fms tyrosine kinase was employed to quantify binding of Grb2. Fms-protein containing either one of the two phosphorylation sites bound Grb2 equally well, binding was increased for proteins carrying both sites. In contrast, the simultaneous substitution of Y696 and Y921 by phenylalanines abolished Grb2 binding. Mouse NIH3T3 cells expressing the Y921F mutant Fms-protein showed a substantially higher content of fibronectin network than wild-type transformed cells and had largely lost their serum independent growth phenotype.",

To address this, we employed a plasmid-based NHEJ DNA repair screen in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using 369 putative nonessential DNA repair-related components as queries. Among the newly identified genes associated with NHEJ deficiency upon disruption are two spindle assembly checkpoint kinases, Bub1 and Bub2. Both observation of resulting phenotypes and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bub1 and -2, either alone or in combination with cell cycle regulators, are recruited near the DSB, where phosphorylated Rad53 or H2A accumulates. Large-scale proteomic analysis of Bub kinases phosphorylated in response to DNA damage identified previously unknown kinase substrates on Tel1 S/T-Q sites. Moreover, Bub1 NHEJ function appears to be conserved in mammalian cells. 53BP1, which influences DSB repair by NHEJ, colocalizes with human BUB1 and is recruited to the break sites. Thus, while Bub is not a core component of NHEJ machinery, our data support its dual role in mitotic exit and promotion of NHEJ repair in yeast and mammals.",

By high-resolution microscopy, we now show that wild-type, but not G2A, Naked2-associated vesicles fuse at the plasma membrane. We further demonstrate that Naked2-associated vesicles are delivered to the lower lateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells independent of mu1B adaptin. We identify a basolateral targeting segment within Naked2; residues 1-173 redirect NHERF-1 from the apical cytoplasm to the basolateral membrane, and internal deletion of residues 37-104 results in apical mislocalization of Naked2 and TGF-alpha. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of Naked2 leads to a dramatic reduction in the 16-kDa cell surface isoform of TGF-alpha and increased cytosolic TGF-alpha immunoreactivity.

During the tethering and rolling of lymphocytes on endothelium, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 binds E-selectin and induces signals. Subsequently, \u03b21 integrin is activated and mediates stable adhesion. However, the intracellular signal pathways from PSGL-1 to \u03b21 integrin have not yet been fully understood. Here, we find that p85, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, forms a novel complex with Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2, a lymphocyte-specific RhoGTPases dissociation inhibitor. Phosporylations of the p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues by c-Abl and Src were required for the complex to be recruited to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and thereby regulate \u03b21 integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Both shRNAs to Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 and p85 and over-expression of Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 Y130F and Y153F significantly reduced the above-mentioned adhesion. Although Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 in the p85-Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 complex was also phosphorylated on 24 tyrosine residue by Syk, the phosphorylation is not required for the adhesion. Taken together, we find that specific phosphorylations on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues of p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 are pivotal for P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1-induced \u03b21 integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.

However, the mechanisms by which it stimulates initiation of DNA replication remain largely unclear. We have analyzed phosphorylation of MCM subunits during cell cycle by examining mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. MCM4 on the chromatin undergoes specific phosphorylation during S phase. Cdc7 phosphorylates MCM4 in the MCM complexes as well as the MCM4 N-terminal polypeptide. Experiments with phospho-amino acid-specific antibodies indicate that the S phase-specific mobility shift is due to the phosphorylation at specific N-terminal (S/T)(S/T)P residues of the MCM4 protein. These specific phosphorylation events are not observed in mouse ES cells deficient in Cdc7 or are reduced in the cells treated with siRNA specific to Cdc7, suggesting that they are mediated by Cdc7 kinase. The N-terminal phosphorylation of MCM4 stimulates association of Cdc45 with the chromatin, suggesting that it may be an important phosphorylation event by Cdc7 for activation of replication origins. Deletion of the N-terminal non-conserved 150 amino acids of MCM4 results in growth inhibition, and addition of amino acids carrying putative Cdc7 target sequences partially restores the growth. Furthermore, combination of MCM4 N-terminal deletion with alanine substitution and deletion of the N-terminal segments of MCM2 and MCM6, respectively, which contain clusters of serine/threonine and are also likely targets of Cdc7, led to an apparent nonviable phenotype. These results are consistent with the notion that the N-terminal phosphorylation of MCM2, MCM4, and MCM6 may play functionally redundant but essential roles in initiation of DNA replication.",

Cys-800 of HIF-1alpha protein has reactive SH-group, which is critical for the recruitment of p300 co-activator that is necessary for transcriptional activity of HIF-1 complex. Here we report that S-nitrosation of Cys-800 activates HIF-1alpha-p300 interaction and stimulates protein transactivation. We have found that S-nitrosation of the HIF-1alpha C-terminal domain by nitric oxide derived from donors and nitric oxide synthase increases protein transcriptional activity. The increase of HIF-1 transcriptional activity was not observed in the case of Cys-800 substitution to Ala, though other protein thiol groups were nitrosated.

Recent studies have shown that the thrombin domain referred to as heparin binding site (HBS) is involved in the interaction with the platelet Gp(Ib)alpha. The HBS is rich in basic amino acids. To identify the key amino acid residues involved in the binding to Gp(Ib)alpha, we have performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of the basic HBS R93, R97, R101, R233, K236, K240, R233/K236/Q239, as well as of the neutral Q239 residues, located in different regions of the domain. For comparison, mutation at R67 within the fibrinogen recognition site (FRS) of thrombin was performed as well. Solid-phase binding experiments showed that the Kd of thrombin-GpIb interaction was reduced 22-fold for R93A, 8-fold for R97A, 13-fold for R101A, 29-fold for R233A, 21-fold for K236A, 5-fold for K240A, and 31-fold for the triple mutant R233A/K236A/Q239A, while the Q239A and R67A forms did not show any significant affinity change. The platelet activating capacity of these mutants was evaluated as well. Using gel-filtered platelets, the EC50 value of thrombin-induced aggregation was from 5- to 13-fold higher in the HBS mutants than in the WT form, and was linearly and positively correlated with the corresponding Kd values pertaining to thrombin binding to GpIb. Measurements of PAR-1 hydrolysis on the platelet membrane showed that the HBS mutants R233A, R101A, R93A, K236A, and R233/K236/Q239 forms had a reduction of the apparent kcat/Km value. These results are a consequence of a defective binding to GpIb, which is known to optimize the interaction with PAR-1 in situ. A confirm of this hypothesis came from the demonstration that the kcat/Km value pertaining to the hydrolysis by the HBS-mutated thrombins of the synthetic PAR-1 38-60 peptide in solution was similar to that one obtained with the WT form. In conclusion, these experiments provide a structural and functional mapping of the thrombin HBS subregions involved in the binding to the platelet Gp(Ib)alpha and in the cell activation.",

However, the exact mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of paclitaxel is poorly understood. Here, paclitaxel induced the apoptosis of cervical cancer HeLa cells and correlated with the enhanced activation of caspase-3 and TAp73, which was strongly inhibited by TAp73beta small interfering RNA (siRNA). In wild-type activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)-overexpressed cells, paclitaxel enhanced apoptosis through increased alpha and beta isoform expression of TAp73; however, these events were attenuated in cells containing inactive COOH-terminal-deleted ATF3 [ATF3(DeltaC)] or ATF3 siRNA. In contrast, paclitaxel-induced ATF3 expression did not change in TAp73beta-overexpressed or TAp73beta siRNA-cotransfected cells. Furthermore, paclitaxel-induced ATF3 translocated into the nucleus where TAp73beta is expressed, but not in ATF3(DeltaC) or TAp73beta siRNA-transfected cells. As confirmed by the GST pull-down assay, ATF3 bound to the DNA-binding domain of p73, resulting in the activation of p21 or Bax transcription, a downstream target of p73. Overexpression of ATF3 prolonged the half-life of TAp73beta by inhibiting its ubiquitination and thereby enhancing its transactivation and proapoptotic activities. Additionally, ATF3 induced by paclitaxel potentiated the stability of TAp73beta, not its transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses show that TAp73beta and ATF3 are recruited directly to the p21 and Bax promoter. Collectively, these results reveal that overexpression of ATF3 potentiates paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells, at least in part, by enhancing TAp73beta's stability and its transcriptional activity. The investigation shows that ATF3 may function as a tumor-inhibiting factor through direct regulatory effects on TAp73beta, suggesting a functional link between ATF3 and TAp73beta.",

The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the ligand-binding GPIbalpha subunit contains binding sites for filamin (residues 561-572, critically Phe568/Trp570), 14-3-3zeta (involving phosphorylation sites Ser587/590 and Ser609), and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3-kinase) regulatory subunit, p85. OBJECTIVES: We previously showed that, as compared with wild-type receptor, deleting the contiguous sequence 580-590 or 591-610, but not upstream sequences, of GPIbalpha expressed as a GPIb-IX complex in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibited VWF-dependent Akt phosphorylation, which is used as a read-out for PI3-kinase activity. Pulldown experiments using glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-p85 or GST-14-3-3zeta constructs, and competitive inhibitors of 14-3-3zeta binding, suggested an independent association of 14-3-3zeta and PI3-kinase with GPIbalpha. The objective of this study was to analyze a further panel of GPIbalpha deletion mutations within residues 580-610. RESULTS: We identified a novel deletion mutant, Delta591-595, that uniquely disrupts 14-3-3zeta binding but retains the functional p85/PI3-kinase association. Deletion of other sequences within the 580-610 region were less discriminatory, and either partially affected p85/PI3-kinase and 14-3-3zeta binding (Delta580-585, Delta586-590, Delta596-600, Delta601-605), or strongly inhibited binding of both proteins (Delta606-610). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings have significant implications for interpreting the functional role of p85 and/or 14-3-3zeta in GPIb-dependent signaling or platelet functional studies involving truncation of the C-terminal residues in cell-based assays and mouse models. The Delta591-595 mutation provides another strategy for determining the function of GPIbalpha-associated 14-3-3zeta by selective disruption of 14-3-3zeta but not p85/PI3-kinase binding.",

TAF1 interacts with and phosphorylates p53 at Thr-55 in vivo. Substitution of Thr-55 with an alanine residue (T55A) stabilizes p53 and impairs the ability of TAF1 to induce G1 progression. Furthermore, both RNAi-mediated TAF1 ablation and apigenin-mediated inhibition of the kinase activity of TAF1 markedly reduced Thr-55 phosphorylation. Thus, phosphorylation and the resultant degradation of p53 provide a mechanism for regulation of the cell cycle by TAF1. Significantly, the Thr-55 phosphorylation was reduced following DNA damage, suggesting that this phosphorylation contributes to the stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage.",

The SH3 domain of CAS mediates its interaction with several proteins involved in signaling pathways such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), tyrosine phosphatases PTP1B and PTP-PEST, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G. As a homolog of the corresponding Src docking domain, the CAS SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences (PxxP) of its interacting partners that can adopt a polyproline type II helix. We have determined a high-resolution X-ray structure of the recombinant human CAS SH3 domain. The domain, residues 1-69, crystallized in two related space groups, P2(1) and C222(1), that provided diffraction data to 1.1 A and 2.1 A, respectively. The crystal structure shows, in addition to the conserved SH3 domain architecture, the way in which the CAS characteristic amino acids form an atypically charged ligand-binding surface. This arrangement provides a rationale for the unusual ligand recognition motif exhibited by the CAS SH3 domain. The structure enables modelling of the docking interactions to its ligands, for example from focal adhesion kinase, and supports structure-based drug design of inhibitors of the CAS-FAK interaction.",

Although phosphorylation of these GEFs is considered an activation mechanism, little is known about the upstream of PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX), a member of the Dbl family of GEFs. We report here that phosphorylation of p85 betaPIX/Cool/p85SPR is mediated via the Ras/ERK/PAK2 pathway. To understand the role of p85 betaPIX in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced neurite outgrowth, we established PC12 cell lines that overexpress the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in a tetracycline-inducible manner. Treatment with bFGF induces the phosphorylation of p85 betaPIX, as determined by metabolic labeling and mobility shift upon gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, phosphorylation of p85 betaPIX is inhibited by PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of the ERK cascade. PAK2, a major PAK isoform in PC12 cells as well as a binding partner of p85 betaPIX, also functions upstream of p85 betaPIX phosphorylation. Surprisingly, PAK2 directly binds to ERK, and its activation is dependent on ERK. p85 betaPIX specifically localizes to the lamellipodia at neuronal growth cones in response to bFGF. A mutant form of p85 betaPIX (S525A/T526A), in which the major phosphorylation sites are replaced by alanine, shows significant defect in targeting. Moreover, expression of the mutant p85 betaPIX efficiently blocks PC12 cell neurite outgrowth. Our study defines a novel signaling pathway for bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth that involves activation of the PAK2-p85 betaPIX complex via the ERK cascade and subsequent translocation of this complex.",

For understanding the molecular mechanisms of these various biological effects, it may be particularly important to analyze cell signaling through the beta1-integrins. Our previous study had shown that PLC-gamma, pp125FAK (focal adhesion kinase), pp105, paxillin, p59fyn, p56lck and ERK1/2 are phosphorylated in their tyrosine residues upon engagement of beta1-integrins. We identified pp105 as Cas (Crk-associated substrate)-related protein and successfully cloned its cDNA. pp105 is a Cas homologue predominantly expressed in the cells of lymphoid lineage, which led us to designate it as Cas-L. Like p130Cas, Cas-L contains a single SH3 domain and multiple SH2 binding sites (YXXP motif), which is suggested to bind SH2 domains of Crk, Nck, and SHPTP2. Subsequent studies revealed that pp125FAK binds Cas-L on its SH3 domain and phosphorylates its tyrosine residues upon beta1-integrin stimulation. Since Cas-L is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes, it is conceivable that Cas-L plays an important role in lymphocyte-specific signals. We have shown that Cas-L is involved in the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 signaling pathway as well as the beta1-integrin signaling pathway. Cas-L is transiently phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L binds to Crk and C3G. Furthermore, a Cas-L mutant (Cas-LDeltaSH3), which lacks the binding site for FAK, is still tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking, but not upon beta1-integrin cross-linking, suggesting that FAK is not involved in CD3-dependent Cas-L phosphorylation. Finally, we have identified a crucial role of Cas-L in beta1-integrin-mediated T-cell co-stimulation. beta1-integrins have known to provide a co-stimulus for TCR/CD3-driven interleukin-2 production and proliferation of peripheral T-cells. We have found that this co-stimulatory pathway is impaired in the Jurkat T-cell line, and that the expression level of Cas-L is reduced in Jurkat cells compared with peripheral T-cells. The transfection of Cas-L cDNA into Jurkat cells restored the beta1-integrin-mediated co-stimulation, while the transfection of Cas-LDeltaSH3 mutant failed to do so, showing a contrast to the case with CD3-mediated signaling. These results indicate that Cas-L plays a key role through the association and phosphorylation by FAK in the beta1-integrin-mediated T-cell co-stimulation. Taken together, Cas-L might be the bi-modal docking protein that assembles the signals through beta1-integrins and TCR/CD3, and participates in a variety of T-cell functions.",

Here, we report a kindred in which affected members had a heterozygous T to G base substitution at nucleotide 2373 of exon 9alpha of the GR gene, causing substitution of Ile by Met at position 747. This mutation was located close to helix 12, at the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain, which has a pivotal role in the formation of activation function (AF)-2, a subdomain that interacts with p160 coactivators. The affinity of the mutant GR for dexamethasone was decreased by about 2-fold, and its transcriptional activity on the glucocorticoid-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus promoter was compromised by 20- to 30-fold. In addition, the mutant GR functioned as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type receptor-induced transactivation. The mutant GR through its intact AF-1 domain bound to a p160 coactivator, but failed to do so through its AF-2 domain. Overexpression of a p160 coactivator restored the transcriptional activity and reversed the negative transdominant activity of the mutant GR. Interestingly, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused GRalphaI747M had a slight delay in its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and formed coarser nuclear speckles than GFP-fused wild-type GRalpha. Similarly, a GFP-fused p160 coactivator had a distinctly different distribution in the nucleus in the presence of mutant vs. wild-type receptor, presenting also as coarser speckling. We conclude that the mutation at amino acid 747 of the GR causes familial, autosomal dominant glucocorticoid resistance by decreasing ligand binding affinity and transcriptional activity, and by exerting a negative transdominant effect on the wild-type receptor. The mutant receptor has an ineffective AF-2 domain, which leads to an abnormal interaction with p160 coactivators and a distinct nuclear distribution of both.",

Specific receptor interactions or functions for the EGF-like repeats have not been identified. We asked whether one or more biological responses to TSP1 might be explained through EGF receptor (EGFR) activation. In A431 cells, TSP1 increased autophosphorylation of Tyr-1068 of EGFR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The ability of TSP1 to activate EGFR was replicated by the tandem EGF-like repeats as a recombinant protein. The three EGF-like repeats alone produced a high level of Tyr-1068 phosphorylation. EGF-like repeats from TSP2 and TSP4 also activated EGFR. Tyr-1068 phosphorylation was less when individual EGF-like repeats were tested or flanking sequences were added to the three EGF-like repeats. TSP1 and its EGF-like repeats also increased phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-845, Tyr-992, Tyr-1045, Tyr-1086, and Tyr-1173, activated phospholipase Cgamma, and increased cell migration. No evidence was found for binding of the EGF-like repeats to EGFR. Instead, EGFR activation in response to TSP1 or its EGF-like repeats required matrix metalloprotease activity, including activity of matrix metalloprotease 9. Access to the ligand-binding portion of the EGFR ectodomain was also required. These findings suggest release of an endogenous EGFR ligand in response to ligation of a second unknown receptor by the TSPs.",

We, thus, searched for novel synphilin-1-interacting proteins and deciphered periphilin as new interactor. Periphilin isoforms are involved in multiple cellular functions in vivo, and the protein is broadly expressed during embryogenesis and in the adult brain. We show that periphilin displays an overlapping expression pattern with synphilin-1 in cellular and animal models and in Lewy bodies of PD patients. Functional studies demonstrate that periphilin, as previously shown for synphilin-1, displays an antiapoptotic function by reducing caspase-3 activity. Searching for mutations in the periphilin gene, we detected a K69E substitution in two patients of a PD family.

Induction of D-type cyclins and their assembly into holoenzyme complexes depend on mitogen stimulation. Conversely, the fact that D-type cyclins are labile proteins guarantees that the subunit pool shrinks rapidly when cells are deprived of mitogens. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on a single threonine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Thr-286) positively regulates proteasomal degradation of D1. Now, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylates cyclin D1 specifically on Thr-286, thereby triggering rapid cyclin D1 turnover. Because the activity of GSK-3beta can be inhibited by signaling through a pathway that sequentially involves Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt), the turnover of cyclin D1, like its assembly, is also Ras dependent and, hence, mitogen regulated. In contrast, Ras mutants defective in PI3K signaling, or constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK1) mutants that act downstream of Ras to activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), cannot stabilize cyclin D1. In direct contrast to cyclin D1, which accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm during S phase, GSK-3beta is predominantly cytoplasmic during G1 phase, but a significant fraction enters the nucleus during S phase. A highly stable D1 mutant in which an alanine is substituted for the threonine at position 286 and that is refractory to phosphorylation by GSK-3beta remained in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of an active, but not a kinase-defective, form of GSK-3beta in mouse fibroblasts caused a redistribution of cyclin D1 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. Therefore, phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 and its subcellular localization during the cell division cycle are linked through the action of GSK-3beta.",

MLH1 functions as a heterodimer with the PMS2 protein, and steady state levels of PMS2 are very low in MLH1-deficient cells. Unique to MLH1 among MutL-homolog proteins, and conserved in identified eukaryotic MLH1 proteins, is the so-called C-terminal homology domain (CTH). The function of these C-terminal 20-30 amino acids is not known. We investigated the effect of a C-terminal truncation of human MLH1 (MLH1-L749X) on mammalian MMR by testing its activity in MLH1-deficient cells. We found the CTH to be essential for suppression of spontaneous mutation, activation of a cytotoxic response to 6-thioguanine, and maintenance of normal steady state levels of PMS2. Co-expression in doubly mutant Mlh1-/-; Pms2-/- fibroblasts showed that MLH1-L749X was unable to stabilize PMS2. Over-expression of MLH1-L749X did not reduce stabilization of PMS2 mediated by wild-type MLH1, indicating that truncation of the CTH reduces the ability to compete with wild-type MLH1 for interaction with PMS2. Lack of PMS2 stabilization also was observed with a previously reported pathogenic truncation (MLH1-Y750X), but not with two different point mutations in the CTH. Biochemical assays demonstrated that truncation of the CTH reduced the stability of heterodimers, although MLH1-L749X retained significant capacity for interaction with PMS2. Thus, the CTH of human MLH1 is necessary for error correction, checkpoint signaling, and for promoting interaction with, and the stability of, PMS2. Analysis of the CTH role in stabilizing PMS2 was facilitated by a novel intracellular assay for MLH1-PMS2 interaction. This assay should prove useful for identifying additional amino acids in MLH1 and PMS2 necessary for interaction in cells, and for determining the functional consequences of MLH1 mutations identified in human cancers.",

The Nlk amino acid sequence is 54. 5% similar and 41.7% identical to murine Erk-2, and 49.6% similar and 38.4% identical to human Cdc2. It possesses an extended amino-terminal domain that is very rich in glutamine, alanine, proline, and histidine. This region bears similarity to repetitive regions found in many transcription factors. Nlk is expressed as a 4. 0-kb transcript at high levels in adult mouse brain tissue, with low levels in other tissues examined, including lung, where two smaller transcripts of 1.0 and 1.5 kb are expressed as well. A 4.0-kb Nlk message is also present during embryogenesis, detectable at day E10. 5, reaching maximal steady state levels at day E12.5, and then decreasing. Nlk transiently expressed in COS7 cells is a 60-kDa kinase detectable by its ability to autophosphorylate. Mutation of the ATP-binding Lys-155 to methionine abolishes its ability to autophosphorylate, as does mutation of a putative activating threonine in kinase domain VIII, to valine, aspartic, or glutamic acid. Subcellular fractionation indicates that 60-70% of Nlk is localized to the nucleus, whereas 30-40% of Nlk is cytoplasmic. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirms that Nlk resides predominantly in the nucleus. Nlk and Nmo may be the first members of a family of kinases with homology to both Erk/MAPKs and Cdks.",

Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas associates with the adaptor protein Crk and the GTP exchange factor C3G. In the same conditions the small G protein Rho was activated, as shown by the increase in its GTP loading. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and Cas as well as triggering of the Crk signaling pathway are blocked by pretreatment of the cells with the exoenzyme C3, a specific Rho inhibitor. C3-sensitive activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase in response to ICAM-1 cross-linking is also observed, whereas no significant activation of Ras or of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase was detected.

FRE1 encodes a surface reductase capable of reducing and mobilizing copper chelates outside the cell, and CTR1 encodes a protein mediating copper uptake at the plasma membrane. In this paper, the protein encoded by MAC1 is identified as the factor mediating this homeostatic control. A novel dominant allele of MAC1, MAC1(up2), is mutated in a Cys-rich domain that may function in copper sensing (a G to A change of nucleotide 812 resulting in a Cys-271 to Tyr substitution). This mutant is functionally similar to the MAC1(up1) allele in which His-279 in the same domain has been replaced by Gln. Both mutations confer constitutive copper-independent expression of FRE1 and CTR1. A sequence including the palindrome TTTGCTCA ... TGAGCAAA, appearing within the 5'-flanking region of the CTR1 promoter, is necessary and sufficient for the copper- and MAC1-dependent CTR1 transcriptional regulation. An identical sequence appears as a direct repeat in the FRE1 promoter. The data indicate that the signal resulting from copper deprivation is transduced via the Cys-rich motif of MAC1 encompassing residues 264-279. MAC1 then binds directly and specifically to the CTR1 and FRE1 promoter elements, inducing transcription of those target genes.

Yeast IQGAP1 homologues have an important role in cytoskeletal organization, suggesting that modulation of the cytoskeleton is a fundamental role of IQGAP1. Phosphorylation is a common mechanism by which cells regulate protein function. Here we demonstrate that endogenous IQGAP1 is highly phosphorylated in MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells. Moreover, incubation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated phosphate incorporation into IQGAP1. By using mass spectrometry, Ser-1443 was identified as the major site phosphorylated on IQGAP1 in intact cells treated with PMA. Ser-1441 was also phosphorylated but to a lesser extent. In vitro analysis with purified proteins documented that IQGAP1 is a substrate for protein kinase Cepsilon, which catalyzes phosphorylation on Ser-1443. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of cellular protein kinase C via bisindolymaleimide abrogated Ser-1443 phosphorylation in response to PMA. To elucidate the biological sequelae of phosphorylation, Ser-1441 and Ser-1443 were converted either to alanine, to create a nonphosphorylatable construct, or to glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively, to generate a phosphomimetic IQGAP1. Although overexpression of wild type IQGAP1 promoted neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, the nonphosphorylatable IQGAP1 S1441A/S1443A had no effect. In contrast, the S1441E/S1443D mutation markedly enhanced the ability of IQGAP1 to induce neurite outgrowth.

S149 in hBVR S/T kinase domain and S230 in YLS230F in hBVR's docking site for the SH2 domain of signaling proteins are phosphorylation targets of PKC-zeta.

In metabolically 32P-labeled HEK293 cells transfected with hBVR or PKC-zeta, TNF-alpha increased hBVR phosphorylation. TNF-alpha did not stimulate PKC-zeta in cells infected with small interfering RNA for hBVR or transfected with hBVR with a point mutation in the nucleotide-binding loop (G17), S149, or S230; this was similar to the response of \"kinase-dead\" PKC-zeta(K281R). We suggest peptide #1 blocks PKC-zeta-docking site interaction, peptide #2 disrupts function of the PKC-zeta C1 domain, and peptide #3 alters ATP presentation to the kinase. The findings are of potential significance for development of modulators of PKC-zeta activity and cellular response to cytokines.",

          "text": "OBJECTIVE: Heterozygous mutations in the Seipin/BSCL2 gene have recently been identified in two autosomal dominant motor neuron diseases, distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V and Silver's syndrome. Seipin protein is reportedly a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N88S and S90L mutations of this protein disrupt its glycosylation, resulting in its aggregation, but the mechanism of neurodegeneration remains unclear. To clarify the molecular pathogenesis of seipin-related motor neuron diseases, we expressed wild-type and mutant seipin proteins in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Coexpression of human seipin and ubiquitin showed that seipin is polyubiquitinated and its ubiquitination is enhanced by mutation. Treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor increased the amounts of mutant seipin in the cells, suggesting that they are degraded through the ER-associated degradation pathway. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that mutant seipin stably binds to the ER chaperone calnexin, indicating accumulation of unfolded mutant seipin in the ER. Furthermore, expression of mutant seipin increased the level of ER stress-mediated molecules and induced apoptosis in cultured cells. INTERPRETATION: These findings demonstrate that seipin/BSCL2-related motor neuron diseases are novel conformational diseases, and we suspect that they are tightly associated with ER stress-mediated cell death.",

We have shown that VEGF stimulates a Rac1-dependent NAD(P)H oxidase to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are involved in VEGFR2 autophosphorylation and angiogenic-related responses in ECs. The small GTPase ARF6 is involved in membrane trafficking and cell motility; however, its roles in VEGF signaling and physiological responses in ECs are unknown. In this study, we show that overexpression of dominant-negative ARF6 [ARF6(T27N)] almost completely inhibits VEGF-induced Rac1 activation, ROS production, and VEGFR2 autophosphorylation in ECs. Fractionation of caveolae/lipid raft membranes demonstrates that ARF6, Rac1, and VEGFR2 are localized in caveolin-enriched fractions basally. VEGF stimulation results in the release of VEGFR2 from caveolae/lipid rafts and caveolin-1 without affecting localization of ARF6, Rac1, or caveolin-1 in these fractions. The egress of VEGFR2 from caveolae/lipid rafts is contemporaneous with the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Tyr14) and VEGFR2 and with their association with each other. ARF6(T27N) significantly inhibits both VEGF-induced responses. Immunofluorescence studies show that activated VEGFR2 and phosphocaveolin colocalize at focal complexes/adhesions after VEGF stimulation. Both overexpression of ARF6(T27N) and mutant caveolin-1(Y14F), which cannot be phosphorylated, block VEGF-stimulated EC migration and proliferation. Moreover, ARF6 expression is markedly upregulated in association with an increase in capillary density in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model of angiogenesis. Thus, ARF6 is involved in the temporal-spatial organization of caveolae/lipid rafts- and ROS-dependent VEGF signaling in ECs as well as in angiogenesis in vivo.",

Accurate prediction of SLiMs has been difficult because they are short (often < 10 amino acids) and highly degenerate. In this study, we combined scoring matrixes derived from peptide library and conservation analysis to identify protein classes enriched of functional SLiMs recognized by SH2, SH3, PDZ and S/T kinase domains. RESULTS: Our combined approach revealed that SLiMs are highly conserved in proteins from functional classes that are known to interact with a specific domain, but that they are not conserved in most other protein groups. We found that SLiMs recognized by SH2 domains were highly conserved in receptor kinases/phosphatases, adaptor molecules, and tyrosine kinases/phosphatases, that SLiMs recognized by SH3 domains were highly conserved in cytoskeletal and cytoskeletal-associated proteins, that SLiMs recognized by PDZ domains were highly conserved in membrane proteins such as channels and receptors, and that SLiMs recognized by S/T kinase domains were highly conserved in adaptor molecules, S/T kinases/phosphatases, and proteins involved in transcription or cell cycle control. We studied Tyr-SLiMs recognized by SH2 domains in more detail, and found that SH2-recognized Tyr-SLiMs on the cytoplasmic side of membrane proteins are more highly conserved than those on the extra-cellular side. Also, we found that SH2-recognized Tyr-SLiMs that are associated with SH3 motifs and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation motif are more highly conserved. CONCLUSION: The interactome of protein domains is reflected by the evolutionary conservation of SLiMs recognized by these domains. Combining scoring matrixes derived from peptide libraries and conservation analysis, we would be able to find those protein groups that are more likely to interact with specific domains.",

          "text": "Mutations in SHP-2 phosphatase that cause hyperactivation of its catalytic activity have been identified in human leukemias, particularly juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which is characterized by hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (IL)-3. However, the molecular mechanisms by which gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 induce hematopoietic malignancies are not fully understood. Our previous studies have shown that SHP-2 plays an essential role in IL-3 signal transduction in both catalytic-dependent and -independent manners and that overexpression (5-6-fold) of wild type (WT) SHP-2 attenuates IL-3-mediated hematopoietic cell function through accelerated dephosphorylation of STAT5. These results raised the possibility that SHP-2-associated leukemias are not solely attributed to the increased catalytic activity of GOF mutant SHP-2. GOF mutant SHP-2 must have gained additional capacities. To test this possibility, we investigated effects of a GOF mutation of SHP-2 (SHP-2 E76K) on hematopoietic cell function and IL-3 signal transduction by comparing with those of overexpressed WT SHP-2. Our results showed that SHP-2 E76K mutation caused myeloproliferative disease in mice, while overexpression of WT SHP-2 decreased hematopoietic potential of the transduced cells in recipient animals. The E76K mutation in the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain increased interactions of mutant SHP-2 with Grb2, Gab2, and p85, leading to hyperactivation of IL-3-induced Erk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. In addition, despite the substantial increase in the catalytic activity, dephosphorylation of STAT5 by SHP-2 E76K was dampened. Furthermore, catalytically inactive SHP-2 E76K with an additional C459S mutation retained the capability to increase the interaction with Gab2 and to enhance the activation of the PI3K pathway. Taken together, these studies suggest that in addition to the elevated catalytic activity, fundamental changes in physical and functional interactions between GOF mutant SHP-2 and signaling partners also play an important role in SHP-2-related leukemigenesis.",

In order to protect itself from the redox onslaughts of host immune system, M. tuberculosis appears to have developed accessory thioredoxin-like proteins which are represented by ORFs encoding WhiB-like proteins. We have earlier reported that WhiB1/Rv3219 is a thioredoxin like protein of M. tuberculosis and functions as a protein disulfide reductase. Generally thioredoxins have many substrate proteins. The current study aims to identify the substrate protein(s) of M. tuberculosis WhiB1. RESULTS: Using yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified alpha (1,4)-glucan branching enzyme (GlgB) of M. tuberculosis as a interaction partner of WhiB1. In vitro GST pull down assay confirmed the direct physical interaction between GlgB and WhiB1. Both mass spectrometry data of tryptic digests and in vitro labeling of cysteine residues with 4-acetamido-4' maleimidyl-stilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid showed that in GlgB, C95 and C658 are free but C193 and C617 form an intra-molecular disulfide bond. WhiB1 has a C37XXC40 motif thus a C40S mutation renders C37 to exist as a free thiol to form a hetero-disulfide bond with the cysteine residue of substrate protein. A disulfide mediated binary complex formation between GlgB and WhiB1C40S was shown by both in-solution protein-protein interaction and thioredoxin affinity chromatography. Finally, transfer of reducing equivalent from WhiB1 to GlgB disulfide was confirmed by 4-acetamido-4' maleimidyl-stilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid trapping by the reduced disulfide of GlgB. Two different thioredoxins, TrxB/Rv1471 and TrxC/Rv3914 of M. tuberculosis could not perform this reaction suggesting that the reduction of GlgB by WhiB1 is specific. CONCLUSION: We conclude that M. tuberculosis GlgB has one intra-molecular disulfide bond which is formed between C193 and C617. WhiB1, a thioredoxin like protein interacts with GlgB and transfers its electrons to the disulfide thus reduces the intra-molecular disulfide bond of GlgB. For the first time, we report that GlgB is one of the in vivo substrate of M. tuberculosis WhiB1.",

Here, we show that recombinant human PEPD (rhPEPD) strongly inhibits ERBB2-overexpressing tumors in mice, whereas it does not impact tumors without ERBB2 overexpression. rhPEPD causes ERBB2 depletion, disrupts oncogenic signaling orchestrated by ERBB2 homodimers and heterodimers, and induces apoptosis. The impact of enzymatically-inactive mutant rhPEPD(G278D) on ERBB2 is indistinguishable from that of rhPEPD, but rhPEPD(G278D) is superior to rhPEPD for tumor inhibition. The enzymatic function of rhPEPD stimulates HIF-1\u03b1 and other pro-survival factors in tumors, which likely attenuates its antitumor activity. rhPEPD(G278D) is also attractive in that it may not interfere with the physiologic function of endogenous PEPD in normal cells. Collectively, we have identified a human protein as an inhibitory ERBB2 ligand that inhibits ERBB2-overexpressing tumors in vivo. Several anti-ERBB2 agents are on the market but are hampered by drug resistance and high drug cost. rhPEPD(G278D) may synergize with these agents and may also be highly cost-effective, since it targets ERBB2 with a different mechanism and can be produced in bacteria.",

In cell lines co-expressing full-length and truncated neu proteins, we observed co-dimerization between full-length p185neu and truncated T691 stop, resulting in the formation of a kinase-inactive heteromeric complex. Phenotypic analysis of several different clones showed that the degree of inhibition of transformation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo was related to the ratio of full-length and truncated p185 proteins co-expressed in cells. These results provide evidence that expression of kinase-deficient neu proteins leads to co-dimerization that results in suppression of kinase activation and oncogenicity of associated p185neu-activated receptors. The mutant neu protein mediates inhibition in both transfected fibroblasts expressing oncogenic p185neu and mammalian cancer cells derived from a rat primary neuroglioblastoma expressing oncogenic p185neu.

Here we used an in vitro approach to identify PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites within insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and to characterize the functional implications. A recombinant IRS-1 fragment (rIRS-1(449)(-)(664)) containing major tyrosine motifs for interaction with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase strongly associated to the p85alpha subunit of PI 3-kinase after Tyr phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Phosphorylation of rIRS-1(449)(-)(664) by PKC-zeta induced a prominent inhibition of this process with a mixture of classical PKC isoforms being less effective. Both PKC-zeta and the classical isoforms phosphorylated rIRS-1(449)(-)(664) on Ser(612). However, modification of this residue did not reduce the affinity of p85alpha binding to pTyr-containing peptides (amino acids 605-615 of rat IRS-1), as determined by surface plasmon resonance. rIRS-1(449)(-)(664) was then phosphorylated by PKC-zeta using [(32)P]ATP and subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide mapping based on two-dimensional HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. Ser(498) and Ser(570) were identified as novel phosphoserine sites targeted by PKC-zeta. Both sites were additionally confirmed by phosphopeptide mapping of the corresponding Ser --> Ala mutants of rIRS-1(449)(-)(664). Ser(570) was specifically targeted by PKC-zeta, as shown by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antiserum against Ser(570) of IRS-1. Binding of p85alpha to the S570A mutant was less susceptible to inhibition by PKC-zeta, when compared to the S612A mutant. In conclusion, our in vitro data demonstrate a strong inhibitory action of PKC-zeta at the level of IRS-1/PI 3-kinase interaction involving multiple serine phosphorylation sites. Whereas Ser(612) appears not to participate in the negative control of insulin signaling, Ser(570) may at least partly contribute to this process.",

High-expression MIF alleles (rs5844572) are associated with rheumatoid joint erosion, but whether MIF signaling through the CD74/CD44 receptor complex promotes upstream autoimmune responses or contributes directly to synovial joint destruction is unknown. We report here the functional regulation of CD44 by an autocrine pathway in synovial fibroblasts that is driven by high-expression MIF alleles to up-regulate an inflammatory and invasive phenotype. MIF increases CD44 expression, promotes its recruitment into a functional signal transduction complex, and stimulates alternative exon splicing, leading to expression of the CD44v3-v6 isoforms associated with oncogenic invasion. CD44 recruitment into the MIF receptor complex, downstream MAPK and RhoA signaling, and invasive phenotype require MIF and CD74 and are reduced by MIF pathway antagonists. These data support a functional role for high-MIF expression alleles and the two-component CD74/CD44 MIF receptor in rheumatoid arthritis and suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway may offer a specific means to interfere with progressive joint destruction.",

However, it is not known how many of these interactions are required for S100A4-promoted metastasis, thus hampering the design of specific inhibitors of S100A4-induced metastasis. Intracellular S100A4 exists as a homodimer through previously identified, well conserved, predominantly hydrophobic key contacts between the subunits. Here it is shown that mutating just one key residue, phenylalanine 72, to alanine is sufficient to reduce the metastasis-promoting activity of S100A4 to 50% that of the wild type protein, and just 2 or 3 specific mutations reduces the metastasis-promoting activity of S100A4 to less than 20% that of the wild type protein. These mutations inhibit the self-association of S100A4 in vivo and reduce markedly the affinity of S100A4 for at least two of its protein targets, a recombinant fragment of non-muscle myosin heavy chain isoform A, and p53. Inhibition of the self-association of S100 proteins might be a novel means of inhibiting their metastasis-promoting activities.",

          "text": "It has been demonstrated that palytoxin binds to and forms a channel within the Na+/K+-ATPase. To investigate whether palytoxin-induced channel formation within the sodium pump can occur independently of ATP hydrolysis and phosphorylation of the enzyme, an Asp369-->Ala mutant of the alpha1 subunit of the sheep sodium pump was produced and coexpressed with beta subunits in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This aspartic acid residue, which during ion transport becomes phosphorylated from ATP, is essential for the function of the sodium pump. Therefore, as expected, microsomes isolated from yeast expressing the mutant sodium pump do not exhibit any ouabain sensitive ATPase activity, whereas in microsomes from yeast expressing the wild-type sodium pump, 60% of the total ATPase activity is ouabain-sensitive. Ouabain binds to yeast membranes containing either wild-type or mutant sodium pumps with similar Bmax (1.45+/-0.05 versus 1.37+/-0.02 pmol/mg) and Kd values (27.7+/-0.91 versus 29.57+/-0.93 nM), thus indicating that the mutant sodium pumps are expressed in the yeast and that the mutation does not considerably affect the conformation of the enzyme. In the presence of phosphate ouabain binds to microsomes containing the wild-type sodium pump with a Kd of 3.62+/-0.34 nM, showing that, although not necessary, phosphoenzyme formation enhances binding of the steroid. Phosphate or ATP, however, inhibit binding of ouabain to microsomes containing the mutant sodium pump with IC50 values of 78+/-3 microM and 3.0+/-0.4 microM, respectively. Despite these radical changes in the interactions of the mutant enzyme with ouabain, the interactions with palytoxin are not affected by the mutation. Palytoxin causes K+ efflux from yeast cells expressing the wild-type or mutant sodium pumps with EC50 values of 3.5+/-0.4 nM and 6.2+/-0.9 nM, respectively. Palytoxin-induced efflux from cells expressing wild-type or mutant sodium pumps occurs with similar t1/2 values of 20.3+/-2.1 min and 22.2+/-3.1 min, respectively. Ouabain inhibits K+ efflux from both cell types with IC50 values of 28+/-2 microM and 210+/-15 microM, respectively. Cells expressing the Asp369-->Ala mutants have an IC50 7.5-fold higher than that obtained with cells expressing the wild-type sodium pumps, possibly because ATP or phosphate present in the cytosol of the yeast cells influence and decrease ouabain binding to the mutant sodium pump. Thus, while ouabain binding and the associated inhibition of ion fluxes is promoted by phosphorylation of the wild-type enzyme by phosphate or ATP, palytoxin-induced channel formation is independent of phosphorylation and can be separated from the ATPase function of the sodium pump. Since ion fluxes through the sodium pump protein do not depend on ATP hydrolysis, the results suggest that the ionophores of pumps and ion channels might share common structural features.",

We previously described two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of v-Rel (v-G37E and v-R273H) that show a ts ability to transform chicken spleen cells and to bind to DNA in vitro. We now show that spleen cell lines transformed by ts v-Rel proteins at the permissive temperature undergo apoptosis when cells are shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. The levels of most proteins (including v-Rel, p53, c-Myc, Rb and Bcl-2) do not change in these cells even at advanced stages of apoptosis. However, the chicken I kappa B-alpha protein (also called p40), which is in a complex with v-Rel in transformed cells, is degraded when ts v-Rel-transformed cells are shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. In v-R273H-transformed cells, p40 is degraded without the appearance of proteolytic intermediates. In contrast, in v-G37E-transformed cells, p40 is cleaved to an intermediate species that is missing approximately 3-4 kDa from its amino terminus. This truncated form of p40 is found in a detergent-insoluble fraction and can also be detected in wild-type v-Rel-transformed cells that are induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with cycloheximide. Both ts v-Rel proteins are ts for interaction with p40 in vitro. The results reported here indicate that v-Rel blocks a normal pathway of programmed cell death and that I kappa B-alpha can undergo multiple degradative pathways, which can be induced by alterations in the structure of the Rel protein to which it is bound.",

The aim of this study was to localize VWF domains that bind to fibrin and to determine their relevance in platelet adhesion. VWF binds specifically to fibrin with an apparent Kd of 2.2 microg/mL. Competition in the presence of 2 complementary fragments, SpIII (residues 1-1365) and SpII (residues 1366-2050), indicated that the high affinity binding site for fibrin is located in the C-terminal part, thus distinct from the A domains. Comparison of 2 deleted rVWF (DeltaD4B-rVWF, DeltaC1C2-rVWF) suggested that the C1C2 domains contained a fibrin binding site. This site is distinct from RGD, as shown by binding of D1746G-rVWF to fibrin. Perfusion studies at high shear rate demonstrated that C1C2 domains were required for optimal platelet adhesion to fibrin. With the use of a VWF-deficient mouse model, it was found that plasma VWF is critical for platelet tethering and adhesion to fibrin. These results suggest a dual role of fibrin-bound VWF in thrombus formation: first, fibrin-bound VWF is critical in the recruitment of platelets by way of glycoprotein (GP) Ib, and, second, it contributes to stationary platelet adhesion by way of binding to activated alphaIIbbeta3.",

While Ras binding to residues 51 to 131 is well understood, the role of the RafC1 cysteine-rich domain comprising residues 139 to 184 has remained elusive. To resolve the function of the RafC1 domain, we have performed an exhaustive surface scanning mutagenesis. In our study, we defined a high-resolution map of multiple distinct functional epitopes within RafC1 that are required for both negative control of the kinase and the positive function of the protein. Activating mutations in three different epitopes enhanced Ras-dependent Raf activation, while only some of these mutations markedly increased Raf basal activity. One contiguous inhibitory epitope consisting of S177, T182, and M183 clearly contributed to Ras-Raf binding energy and represents the putative Ras binding site of the RafC1 domain. The effects of all RafC1 mutations on Ras binding and Raf activation were independent of Ras lipid modification. The inhibitory mutation L160A is localized to a position analogous to the phorbol ester binding site in the protein kinase C C1 domain, suggesting a function in cofactor binding. Complete inhibition of Ras-dependent Raf activation was achieved by combining mutations K144A and L160A, which clearly demonstrates an absolute requirement for correct RafC1 function in Ras-dependent Raf activation.",

The salient feature of this structural transition is the movement of the B and C helices, which is termed the \"opening\" of the N-domain. This movement exposes a hydrophobic region, allowing interaction with the regulatory domain of troponin I (TnI) as can be seen in the crystal structure of the troponin ternary complex [Takeda, S., Yamashita, A., Maeda, K., and Maeda, Y. (2003) Nature 424, 35-41]. In contrast to skeletal TnC, Ca(2+)-binding site I (an EF-hand motif that consists of an A helix-loop-B helix motif) is inactive in cardiac TnC. The question arising from comparisons with skeletal TnC is how both helices move according to Ca(2+) binding or interact with TnI in cardiac TnC. In this study, we examined the Ca(2+)-induced movement of the B and C helices relative to the D helix in a cardiac TnC monomer state and TnC-TnI binary complex by means of site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Doubly spin-labeled TnC mutants were prepared, and the spin-spin distances were estimated by analyzing dipolar interactions with the Fourier deconvolution method. An interspin distance of 18.4 A was estimated for mutants spin labeled at G42C on the B helix and C84 on the D helix in a Mg(2+)-saturated monomer state. The interspin distance between Q58C on the C helix and C84 on the D helix was estimated to be 18.3 A under the same conditions. Distance changes were observed by the addition of Ca(2+) ions and the formation of a complex with TnI. Our data indicated that the C helix moved away from the D helix in a distinct Ca(2+)-dependent manner, while the B helix did not. A movement of the B helix by interaction with TnI was observed. Both Ca(2+) and TnI were also shown to be essential for the full opening of the N-domain in cardiac TnC.",

We have previously shown that in its endocytic role, Vps1 functions with the amphiphysin heterodimer Rvs161/Rvs167 to facilitate scission and release of vesicles. Phosphoproteome studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified a phosphorylation site in Vps1 at serine 599. In this study, we confirmed this phosphorylation event, and we reveal that, like Rvs167, Vps1 can be phosphorylated by the yeast cyclin-associated kinase Pho85 in vivo and in vitro. The importance of this posttranslational modification was revealed when mutagenesis of S599 to a phosphomimetic or nonphosphorylatable form caused defects in endocytosis but not in other functions associated with Vps1. Mutation to nonphosphorylatable valine inhibited the Rvs167 interaction, while both S599V and S599D caused defects in vesicle scission, as shown by both live-cell imaging and electron microscopy of endocytic invaginations. Our data support a model in which phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Vps1 promote distinct interactions and highlight the importance of such regulatory events in facilitating sequential progression of the endocytic process.",

Only the W259A, F260A, and W259A/F260A mutations reduced the binding affinity and potency of sauvagine.

The W259A, F260A, and W259A/F260A mutations also decreased the affinity of the endogenous ligand, CRF, implying that these residues may play a common important role in the binding of different peptides belonging to CRF family. Parallel amino acid deletions of the two peptides produced ligands with various affinities for wild-type CRF(1) compared with the W259A, F260A, and W259A/F260A mutants, supporting the interaction between the amino-terminal residues 8 to 10 of sauvagine and the corresponding region in CRF with EL2 of CRF(1).

Individuals heterozygous for this mutation show a platelet GPIIb-IIIa content approximately 30% of normal controls, which is less than expected from one normal functioning allele. Coexpression of normal [674C]GPIIb and mutant [674R]GPIIb with normal GPIIIa produced a [674R]GPIIb concentration-dependent inhibition of surface exposure of GPIIb-IIIa complexes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, suggesting that [674R]GPIIb interferes with the association and/or intracellular trafficking of normal subunits. Mutation of either 674C or 687C had similar effects in reducing the surface exposure of GPIIb-IIIa. However, substitution of 674C for A produced a much lesser inhibition than R, suggesting that a positive-charged residue at that position renders a less efficient subunit conformation. The mutant [674R]GPIIb but not normal GPIIb was found associated with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP in transiently transfected CHO cells. BiP was also found associated with [674R]GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers, but not with normal GPIIIa or normal heterodimers. Overexpression of BiP did not increase the surface exposure of [674R]GPIIb-IIIa complexes, indicating that its availability was not a limiting step. Platelets from the thrombasthenic patient expressing [674R]GPIIb-IIIa were found to bind soluble fibrinogen in response to physiologic agonists or dithiothreitol treatment. Thus, the [674R]GPIIb mutation leads to a retardation of the secretory pathway, most likely related to its binding to the molecular chaperone BiP, with the result of a defective number of functional GPIIb-IIIa receptors in the cell surface.",

Ryanodine has been widely used to identify contributions made by the RyR to signaling in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. Ryanodine, through binding to high- and low-affinity sites, has been suggested to block the channel pore based on its ability to induce partial conductance states and irreversible inhibition. We examined the effect of ryanodine on an RyR type 1 (RyR1) point mutant (E4032A) that exhibits a severely compromised phenotype. When expressed in 1B5 (RyR null/dyspedic) myotubes, E4032A is relatively unresponsive to stimulation by cell membrane depolarization or RyR agonists, although the full-length protein is correctly targeted to junctions and interacts with dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) inducing their arrangement into tetrads. However, treatment of E4032A-expressing cells with 200-500 microM ryanodine, concentrations that rapidly activate and then inhibit wild-type (wt) RyR1, restores the responsiveness of E4032A-expressing myotubes to depolarization and RyR agonists. Moreover, the restored E4032A channels remain resistant to subsequent exposure to ryanodine. In single-channel studies, E4032A exhibits infrequent (channel-open probability, P(o) < 0.005) and brief (<250 micros) gating events and insensitivity to Ca(2+). Addition of ryanodine restores Ca(2+)-dependent channel activity exhibiting full, 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 substates. This evidence suggests that, whereas ryanodine does not occlude the RyR pore, it does bind to sites that allosterically induce substantial conformational changes in the RyR. In the case of E4032A, these changes overcome unfavorable energy barriers introduced by the E4032A mutation to restore channel function.",

We have previously reported that transfection of p53 gain of function mutant alleles into LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive cell line, allows for AI growth of LNCaP in vitro. We herein confirm the in vivo relevance of those findings by demonstrating that the R273H p53 mutation (p53(R273H)) facilitates AI growth in castrated nude mice. In addition, we demonstrate that H2 relaxin is responsible for facilitating p53(R273H)-mediated AI CaP. H2 relaxin is overexpressed in the LNCaP-R273H subline. Downregulation of H2 relaxin expression results in significant inhibition of AI growth, whereas addition of recombinant human H2 relaxin to parental LNCaP promotes AI growth. Inhibition of AI growth was also achieved by blocking expression of LGR7, the cognate receptor of H2 relaxin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to demonstrate that p53(R273H) binds directly to the relaxin promoter, further confirming a role for H2 relaxin signaling in p53(R273H)-mediated AI CaP. Lastly, we used a reporter gene assay to demonstrate that H2 relaxin can induce the expression of prostate-specific antigen via an androgen receptor-mediated pathway.",

We demonstrate that HspH, a bacterial alpha-Hsp from the soybean-symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum, assembles into dynamic complexes freely exchanging subunits with homologous and heterologous complexes. The importance of the alpha-crystallin domain for oligomerisation and chaperone activity was tested by site-directed mutagenesis of 12 different residues. In contrast to mammalian alpha-Hsps, the majority of these mutations elicited severe structural and functional defects in HspH. The individual exchange of five amino acid residues throughout the alpha-crystallin domain was found to compromise oligomerisation to various degrees. Assembly defects resulting in complexes of reduced size correlated with greatly decreased or abolished chaperone activity, reinforcing that complete oligomerisation is required for functionality. Mutation of a highly conserved glycine (G114) at the C-terminal end of the alpha-crystallin domain specifically impaired chaperone activity without interfering with oligomerisation properties, indicating that this residue is critical for substrate interaction. The structural and functional importance of this and other residues is discussed in the context of a modeled three-dimensional structure of HspH.",

In this study, the 109-kD Msh2 polypeptide was overexpressed and purified to analyze its DNA-binding properties. This analysis demonstrated that Msh2 can bind selectively to duplex oligonucleotide substrates containing a G/T mismatch, 1- to 14-nucleotide insertion mismatches, and palindromic (12- to 14-nucleotide) insertion mismatches. A general trend was that the affinity of Msh2 for substrate was proportional to the size of the insertion mispair present (+14 PAL, +12 PAL > +14 > +8 > GT, +6, +4, +2, +1). Kinetic studies indicated that the specificity of Msh2 to mismatch substrates was a function of its ability to form stable complexes with mispair-containing duplex DNAs.

VDR acts in most cases as a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) from specific DNA sequences in the promoter of VD target genes called VD response elements (VDREs). This study describes a mutation (K45A) of the VDR DNA binding domain that enhances the affinity and ligand responsiveness of VDR-RXR heterodimers on some VDREs. In analogy to a homologous mutation in the glucocorticoid receptor (K461A), this lysine residue appears to function as an allosteric 'lock'. Interestingly, overexpression of RXR was found to reduce the responsiveness and sensitivity of wild type VDR to VD, but enhance the response of VDRK45A. Moreover, the transactivation domains of both VDR and RXR were shown to be essential for obtaining responsiveness of the heterodimers to VD and 9- cis retinoic acid (the RXR ligand). This indicates that RXR is an active rather than silent partner of the VDR on the VDREs tested. Taken together, transactivation by VDR-RXR heterodimers can be triggered individually by all components of the protein-DNA complex, but full potency appears to be reached through allosteric interaction.",

Proteins in HeLa cell lysate of molecular sizes 27, 38 and 40 kDa bound to the phosphorylated, but not to the unphosphorylated peptide. Analyses of partial amino acid sequences of the purified proteins indicated that they were identical to CrkI, CrkII and CrkL respectively. The wild-type PDGF alpha-receptor, when expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells, formed complexes with CrkII and CrkL upon ligand stimulation, which was specifically inhibited by a synthetic peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-762. Replacement of Tyr-762 with a phenylalanine residue in the PDGF alpha-receptor abrogated ligand-induced binding of Crk proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkL increased by 1.8- and 1.3-fold, respectively, upon ligand stimulation of the wild-type alpha-receptor. In contrast, the Y762F mutant PDGF alpha-receptor failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk proteins. CrkII and CrkL constitutively formed complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, in unstimulated as well as PDGF-stimulated cells. Moreover, the activated wild-type PDGF alpha-receptor but not the Y762F mutant receptor was found in a C3G immunoprecipitate, suggesting that a ternary complex between the activated PDGF alpha-receptor, Crk and C3G was formed. DNA synthesis stimulated by PDGF-BB as well as PDGF-induced MAP kinase activation was similar in cells expressing wild-type and mutant receptors. Interestingly, the activated PDGF beta-receptor was found not to bind Crk proteins. Instead, Tyr-771 of the beta-receptor, which is localized at an analogous position to Tyr-762 in the alpha-receptor, binds RasGAP. RasGAP is not bound to the alpha-receptor.

Upon EGFR activation, endogenous Shoc2 and red fluorescent protein tagged Shoc2 were translocated from the cytosol to a subset of late endosomes containing Rab7. The endosomal recruitment of Shoc2 was blocked by overexpression of a GDP-bound H-RAS (N17S) mutant and RNAi knockdown of clathrin, suggesting the requirement of RAS activity and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. RNAi depletion of Shoc2 strongly inhibited activation of ERK1/2 by low, physiological EGF concentrations, which was rescued by expression of wild-type recombinant Shoc2. In contrast, the Shoc2 (S2G) mutant, that is myristoylated and found in patients with the Noonan-like syndrome, did not rescue ERK1/2 activation in Shoc2-depleted cells. Shoc2 (S2G) was not located in late endosomes but was present on the plasma membrane and early endosomes. These data suggest that targeting of Shoc2 to late endosomes may facilitate EGFR-induced ERK activation under physiological conditions of cell stimulation by EGF, and therefore, may be involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling through the RAS-RAF module.",

We report here that erythropoietin regulates the transcription of the TIMP-1 gene upon binding to its receptor in erythroid cells by triggering the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. We found that Akt directly phosphorylates the transcription factor GATA-1 at serine 310 and that this site-specific phosphorylation is required for the transcriptional activation of the TIMP-1 promoter. This chain of events can be recapitulated in nonerythroid cells by transfection of the implicated molecular partners, resulting in the expression of the normally silent endogenous TIMP-1 gene. Conversely, TIMP-1 secretion is profoundly decreased in erythroid cells from fetal livers of transgenic knock-in mice homozygous for a GATA(S310A) gene, which encodes a GATA-1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser(310). Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated expression of GATA(S310A) into GATA-1(null)-derived embryonic stem cells decreases the rate of hemoglobinization by more than 50% compared to expressed wild-type GATA-1. These findings provide the first example of a chain of coupling mechanisms between the binding of erythropoietin to its receptor and GATA-1-dependent gene expression.",

This peptide also bound to von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and fibronectin (Fn), but did not attach to a 50 kDa Fn fragment which is deficient in the cell attachment site. In addition, purified GPIIb/IIIa displaced GPIIIa 217-231(Y) from Fg and vWF. Binding of 125I-GPIIIa 217-231(Y) to Fg coated tubes was inhibited by soluble Fg and by the GPIIb/IIIa complex. We synthesized this peptide with several alterations; similar peptides with Pro-219 replaced with an Ala showed significantly reduced binding to Fg and vWF. The decreased binding of the peptides with Pro-219 substitutes suggests that the confirmation of GPIIIa 217-230 is important for its ability to bind to adhesive ligands. In conclusion, the amino acid residues between 217 and 231 of GPIIIa appear to be involved in ligand binding and Pro-219 probably plays a significant role in this interaction.",

Both constructs harboured a 24 base pairs insertion placed upstream of the initiating ATG [Peakman, Charles, Sydenham, Gewert, Page, and Makoff (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 6111-6112]. Despite its hexa-histidine extension, the monovalent recombinant protein from crude culture media failed to bind immobilized Ni2+ unless proteins were first precipitated twice by ammonium sulphate. The overall procedure then yielded approximately 10mg/l of protein which could be purified to near homogeneity using two additional chromatographic steps. The glycosylated polypeptide migrated as a band of Mr=(21-31) x 10(3) in SDS/PAGE and was monomeric in physiological buffers. Under non-reducing conditions, denaturation in 6 M guanidinium chloride was reversible after slow removal of the denaturing agent. The mFasR immunoadhesin was secreted (approximately 5-10 mg/l) as a disulphide-linked homodimer, and endowed with ligand-binding activity since it could bind FasL on the surface of D11S, FasL-expressing cells. When tested for their ability to inhibit FasR-dependent cell lysis, the soluble dimeric immunoadhesin markedly inhibited FasL-mediated cytotoxicity (IC50 approximately 30 nM), and was approximately 6 times as effective as its monomeric counterpart.",

Here, we show that hMRE11 deficiency leads to significant increase in MSI for both mono- and dinucleotide sequences. Furthermore, RNA-interference-mediated hMRE11-knockdown in HeLa cells results in MMR deficiency. Analysis of seven HNPCC-associated hMLH1 missense mutations located within the hMRE11-interacting domain shows that four mutations (L574P, K618T, R659P and A681T) cause near-complete disruption of the interaction between hMRE11 and hMLH1, and two mutations (Q542L and L582V) cause a 30% reduction of protein interaction.

Nitric oxide (NO) stimulates the Ras - ERK1/2 MAP kinases signaling pathway and is involved in the interaction between Ras and the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 Kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway and cell migration. This study utilizes bradykinin (BK), which promotes endogenous production of NO, in an investigation of the role of NO in the activation of Rac1 in rabbit aortic endothelial cells (RAEC). NO-derived from BK stimulation of RAEC and incubation of the cells with the s-nitrosothiol S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) activated Rac1.

The use of RAEC permanently transfected with the dominant negative mutant of Ras (Ras(N17)) or with the non-nitrosatable mutant of Ras (Ras(C118S)); and the use of specific inhibitors of: Ras, PI3K, and Rac1 resulted in inhibition of NO-mediated Rac1 activation. BK-stimulated s-nitrosylation of Ras in RAEC mediates Rac1 activation and cell migration. Inhibition of NO-mediated Rac1 activation resulted in inhibition of endothelial cell migration.

We here characterize a p110\u03b2 helical domain mutation, E633K, first identified in a Her2-positive breast cancer. The mutation increases basal p110\u03b2 activity, but does not affect activation of p85/p110\u03b2 dimers by phosphopeptides or G\u03b2\u03b3. Expression of the mutant causes increases in Akt and S6K1 activation, transformation, chemotaxis, proliferation and survival in low serum. E633 is conserved among class I PI3 Ks, and its mutation in p110\u03b2 is also activating. Interestingly, the E633K mutant occurs near a region that interacts with membranes in activated PI 3-kinases, and its mutation abrogates the requirement for an intact Ras-binding domain in p110\u03b2-mediated transformation. We propose that the E633K mutant activates p110\u03b2 by enhancing its basal association with membranes. This study presents the first analysis of an activating oncogenic mutation of p110\u03b2.",

Defective mutations cause a rare bleeding disorder, Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Only two antigenic polymorphisms have thus far been established in these proteins: the HPA-2 in GP Ib alpha and the rare Iy variant in GP Ib beta. Recently, we reported that only a limited degree of polymorphism can be found in the GP Ib alpha gene; the level of variation in the other components is not known. We therefore systematically screened polymorphism in the GP Ib beta, GP IX, and GP V genes in 50 unrelated Finnish blood donors. Nine polymorphic sites were found in the GP V gene, of which four changed the amino acid code and five were silent. The gene frequencies for substitutions Asp114Tyr, Met273Ile, Gly341Arg, and Leu397Arg were 1%, 1%, 2%, and 1% respectively. The five silent polymorphisms also had low frequencies, 1-4%. No polymorphism was found in the GP Ib beta gene and only one mutation was found in the 3' untranslated region of the GP IX gene.

In order to study the effects of DYRK1A on G6Pase gene expression, we generated a H4IIEC3 rat hepatoma cell line stably expressing DYRK1A by retroviral infection. Overexpression of DYRK1A increased the expression of G6Pase about threefold, as determined by Northern blotting. In transiently transfected HepG2 cells, co-expression of DYRK1A and a G6Pase promoter construct increased G6Pase promoter activity about twofold. This effect of DYRK1A was independent of its kinase activity, since a kinase-dead DYRK1A mutant as well as a point mutant of the phosphorylation site of DYRK1A in FKHR (Ser329Ala) failed to affect the effect of DYRK1A on the G6Pase expression. The effect of DYRK on the G6Pase promoter activity was produced by the isoforms DYRK1A and DYRK1B, which are localized in the nucleus, but not by DYRK2. Mutations of the FKHR-binding sites in the G6Pase promoter markedly reduced the effect of DYRK1 on the G6Pase promoter activity. In summary, the data suggest that DYRK1 is a specific co-activator of FKHR, independent of its kinase activity.",

Moreover, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) inhibits TGF-beta1 activation of three TGF-beta1-responsive promoter constructs, 3TP-luciferase, AP-1-luciferase, and SBE4(BV)-luciferase, in LNCaP cells either with or without enforced expression of TGF-beta receptors (TbetaRI and TbetaRII).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the AR ligand binding domain directly inhibits the association of Smad3 to the Smad-binding element.

Down-regulation of these \"death\" receptors protects adenovirus-infected cells from apoptosis induced by the death receptor ligands Fas ligand and TRAIL. RID also down-regulates certain tyrosine kinase cell surface receptors, especially the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). RID-mediated Fas and EGFR down-regulation occurs via endocytosis of the receptors into endosomes followed by transport to and degradation within lysosomes. However, the molecular interactions underlying this function of RID are unknown. To investigate the molecular determinants of RIDbeta that are involved in receptor down-regulation, mutations within the cytoplasmic tail of RIDbeta were constructed and the mutant proteins were analyzed for their capacity to internalize and degrade Fas and EGFR and to protect cells from death receptor ligand-induced apoptosis. The results demonstrated the critical nature of a tyrosine residue near the RIDbeta C terminus; mutation of this residue to alanine abolished RID function. Mutating the tyrosine to phenylalanine did not abolish the function of RID, arguing that phosphorylation of the tyrosine is not required for function. These data suggest that this tyrosine residue forms part of a tyrosine-based sorting signal (Yxxphi). Additional mutations that target another potential sorting motif and several possible protein-protein interaction motifs had no discernible effect on RID function. It was also demonstrated that mutation of serine 116 to alanine eliminated phosphorylation of RIDbeta but did not affect any of the functions of RID that were examined. These results suggest a model in which the tyrosine-based sorting signal in RID plays a role in RID's ability to down-regulate receptors.",

In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that PTHrP regulates both Runx2 and Runx3 protein stability through cyclin D1. We analyzed the effects of cyclin D1 on Runx3 protein stability and function using COS cells, osteoprogenitor C3H10T1/2 cells and chondrogenic RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. We found that cyclin D1 induced Runx3 degradation in a dose-dependent manner and that both Myc-tagged Runx3 and endogenous Runx3 interact directly with CDK4 in COS and RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. A conserved CDK recognition site was identified in the C-terminal region of Runx3 by sequence analysis (residues 356-359). Pulse-chase experiments showed that the mutation of Runx3 at Ser356 to alanine (SA-Runx3) increased the half-life of Runx3. By contrast, the mutation at the same serine residue to glutamic acid (SE-Runx3) accelerated Runx3 degradation. In addition, SA-Runx3 was resistant to cyclin D1-induced degradation. GST-Runx3 was strongly phosphorylated by CDK4 in vitro. By contrast, CDK4 had no effect on the phosphorylation of SA-Runx3. Although both wild-type and SE-Runx3 were ubiquitylated, this was not the case for SA-Runx3. Runx3 degradation by cyclin D1 was completely blocked by the proteasome inhibitor PS1. In C3H10T1/2 cells, SA-Runx3 had a greater effect on reporter activity than SE-Runx3. The same was true for ALP activity in these cells. To investigate the role of cyclin D1 in chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, we analyzed the growth plate morphology and expression of chondrocyte differentiation marker genes in Ccnd1-knockout mice. The proliferating and hypertrophic zones were significantly reduced and expression of chondrocyte differentiation marker genes and ALP activity were enhanced in 2-week-old Ccnd1-knockout mice. PTHrP significantly suppressed protein levels of both Runx2 and Runx3 in primary chondrocytes derived from wild-type mice. By contrast, the suppressive effect of PTHrP on Runx2 and Runx3 protein levels was completely abolished in primary chondrocytes derived from Ccnd1-knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate that the cell cycle proteins cyclin D1 and CDK4 induce Runx2 and Runx3 phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. PTHrP suppresses Runx2 and Runx3 protein levels in chondrocytes through cyclin D1. These results suggest that PTHrP might prevent premature hypertrophy in chondrocytes, at least in part by inducing degradation of Runx2 and Runx3 in a cyclin-D1-dependent manner.",

Casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylates VDR both in vitro and in vivo at serine 208 within the hinge domain. This phosphorylation does not affect the ability of VDR to bind DNA, but increases its ability to transactivate target promoters. Here, we have analyzed whether phosphorylation of VDR by CKII modulates the ability of VDR to interact with coactivators in vitro. We find that both mutation of serine 208 to aspartic acid (VDRS208D) or phosphorylation of VDR by CKII enhance the interaction of VDR with DRIP205 in the presence of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3. We also find that the mutation VDRS208D neither affects the ability of this protein to bind DNA nor to interact with SRC-1 and RXRalpha. Together, our results indicate that phosphorylation of VDR at serine 208 contributes to modulate the affinity of VDR for the DRIP complex and therefore may have a role in vivo regulating VDR-mediated transcriptional enhancement.",

Because PKCiota/lambda kinase activity was necessary for vesicle formation, a search was initiated to identify the substrate(s) that potentiate Rab2 function within VTCs. In this study, we found that PKCiota/lambda phosphorylates GAPDH. Moreover, GAPDH interacts directly with the PKCiota/lambda regulatory domain. Based on numerous observations that show (beta-COP) GAPDH associates with cytoskeletal elements, we examined the role of phospho-GAPDH in promoting microtubule (MT) binding to membrane. Using a quantitative microsomal binding assay, we found that membrane association of beta-tubulin was dependent on phospho-GAPDH and was blocked by reagents that interfere with Rab2-dependent GAPDH membrane recruitment or with PKCiota/lambda kinase activity. Furthermore, normal rat kidney cells transfected with a constitutively activated form of Rab2 (Q65L) or with our anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody displayed a dramatic change in MT organization. These combined results suggest that Rab2 stimulated PKCiota/lambda and GAPDH recruitment to VTCs, and the subsequent PKCiota/lambda phosphorylation of GAPDH ultimately influences MT dynamics in the early secretory pathway.",

Through its RH domain, p115RhoGEF also functions as a GAP for G alpha(13). The mechanism for the G alpha(13)/p115RhoGEF interaction is not well understood. Here, we determined specific alpha(13) residues important for its interaction with p115RhoGEF. GST-pulldowns and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that individually mutating alpha(13) residues Lys204, Glu229, or Arg232 to opposite charge residues disrupts the interaction of activated alpha(13) with the RH domain of p115RhoGEF or full-length p115RhoGEF. We further demonstrate that mutation of Glu229, and to a lesser extent Lys204 or Arg232, disrupts the ability of activated alpha(13) to induce the recruitment of p115RhoGEF to the plasma membrane (PM) and to activate Rho-mediated serum response element-luciferase gene transcription. Interestingly, an alpha(13) mutant where a conserved Gly was mutated to a Ser (G205S) retained its ability to bind to p115RhoGEF, induce p115RhoGEF recruitment to the PM, and activate Rho-dependent signaling, even though identical Gly to Ser mutations in other alpha disrupt their interaction with regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins.

The greatest increase in binding (6-9-fold) was observed with the A85K-RBD mutant. The elevated binding for the A85K-RBD and V88R-RBD mutants was also detected with Ras expressed in cultured mammalian cells, namely NIH-3T3 and BAF cells. None of the wild type residues in RBD positions Asn(64), Ala(85), and Val(88) have been previously implicated in the interaction with Ras (Block, C., Janknecht, R., Herrmann, C., Nassar, N., and Wittinghofer, A.

The discovery of elevated binding among the mutants in these positions implies that additional RBD residues can be used to generate the Ras. RBD complex. These findings are of particular significance in the design of Ras antagonists based on the RBD prototype. The A85K-RBD mutant can be used to develop an assay for measuring the level of activated Ras in cultured cells; Sepharose-linked A85K-RBD.GST fusion protein served as an activation-specific probe to precipitate Ras.GTP but not Ras.GDP from epidermal growth factor-stimulated cells.

To develop a better understanding of axonal guidance at the molecular level, we purified proteins in a complex with the SH2 domain of Dock from fly Schneider 2 cells. A protein designated p145 was identified and shown to be a tyrosine kinase with sequence similarity to mammalian Cdc-42-associated tyrosine kinases. We demonstrate that Drosophila Ack (DAck) can be co-immunoprecipitated with Dock and DSH3PX1 from fly cell extracts. The domains responsible for the in vitro interaction between Drosophila Ack and Dock were identified, and direct protein-protein interactions between complex members were established. We conclude that DSH3PX1 is a substrate for DAck in vivo and in vitro and define one of the major in vitro sites of DSH3PX1 phosphorylation to be Tyr-56. Tyr-56 is located within the SH3 domain of DSH3PX1, placing it in an important position for regulating the binding of proline-rich targets. We demonstrate that Tyr-56 phosphorylation by DAck diminishes the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain interaction with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein while enabling DSH3PX1 to associate with Dock. Furthermore, when Tyr-56 is mutated to aspartate or glutamate, the binding to Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein is abrogated. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of DSH3PX1 by DAck targets this sorting nexin to a protein complex that includes Dock, an adaptor protein important for axonal guidance.",

Introduction of C-terminal deletions or a point mutation at position 586 (Pro --> Glu) resulted in the loss of the E2 binding activity. A second more N-terminally located binding domain (E1 amino acids 312--450) became active when the assays were performed at 22 degrees.

The beta(3) mutants beta(3)C177A, beta(3)C273A, and beta(3)C598Y exhibited a decreased electrophoretic mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, confirming the disruption of the respective disulfide loops. Despite reduced surface expression, the alpha(IIb)beta(3)C177A, alpha(IIb)beta(3)C273A, and alpha(IIb)beta(3)C598Y receptors mediated cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and translocated into focal adhesion plaques. The beta(3)C598Y mutation, but not the beta(3)C177A or beta(3)C273A mutations, induced spontaneous binding of the ligand mimetic monoclonal antibody PAC-1, while the beta(3)C177A and beta(3)C273A mutants exhibited reduced complex stability in the absence of Ca(2+). Epitope mapping of function-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) allowed the identification of two distinct subgroups; mAbs A2A9, pl2-46, 10E5, and P256 did not interact with alpha(IIb)beta(3)C273A and bound only weakly to alpha(IIb)beta(3)C177A, while mAbs AP2, LM609 and 7E3 bound normally to mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3)C273A, but interacted only weakly with mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3)C177A.

Finally, the ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) epitopes AP5, D3, LIBS1, and LIBS2 were spontaneously expressed on all three mutants independent of RGDS or dithiothreitol treatment. Our results provide evidence that disruption of a single cysteine disulfide bond in the cysteine-rich repeat domain, but not in the I-like domain, activates integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3). In contrast, disruption of each of the disulfide bonds in the two long insertions of the I-like domain predicted to be in close contact with the alpha subunit beta-propeller domain affect the stability of the alpha(IIb)beta(3) heterodimer and inhibit complex-specific mAb binding without affecting the RGD binding capacity of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like domain.",

The glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4) is primarily responsible for the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose uptake. Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 is recruited from intracellular reserves to the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the translocation of GLUT4 to the sarcolemma remain to be fully identified. Here, we demonstrate that GLUT4 is localized to perinuclear stores that contain flotillin-1, a marker of lipid rafts, in skeletal muscle cells. Stimulation with insulin for 10 min results in the translocation of flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains to the plasma membrane in a PI3K- and PKCzeta-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that caveolin-3, a marker of caveolae, is required for the insulin receptor-mediated activation of the PI3K-dependent pathway, which occurs 2 min after insulin stimulation. In fact, we demonstrate that lack of caveolin-3 significantly reduces insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in caveolin-3 null myotubes by inhibiting both PI3K and Akt, as well as the movement of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, caveolin-3 moves away from the plasma membrane toward the cytoplasm 5 min after insulin stimulation and temporarily interacts with flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains before they reach the sarcolemma, with the consequent movement of the insulin receptor from caveolin-3-containing domains to flotillin-1-containing domains. Such translocation temporally matches the insulin-stimulated movement of Cbl and CrkII in flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains, as well as the activation of the GDP-GTP exchange factor C3G. Disruption of flotillin-1-based domains prevents the activation of C3G, movement of GLUT4 to the sarcolemma, and glucose uptake in response to insulin. Thus, the activation of the Cbl/C3G/TC10-dependent pathway, which occurs before flotillin-1/GLUT4-containing domains reach the plasma membrane, is flotillin-1 mediated and follows the activation of the PI3K-mediated signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that flotillin-1 and caveolin-3 may regulate muscle energy metabolism through the spatial and temporal segregation of key components of the insulin signaling.",

In this report we have examined activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) by the three known vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1-3), as well as by the endothelial Tie-1 and -2 receptors. We also studied signaling by the R849W mutant of Tie-2 (MTie-2), which has been shown to cause venous malformations. When overexpressed in 293T cells, MTie-2 activated STAT1 while the other endothelial RTKs failed to do so. In contrast, the three VEGFRs were strong activators of STAT3 and STAT5, suggesting that they activate only a specific subset of these signal transducers. STAT3 and STAT5 were also activated by Tie-2 and, more so, by MTie-2. Tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of STATs correlated with their ability to activate transcription as judged by luciferase assays. When co-expressed with STAT5, VEGFR-1 as well as both the Tie-2 receptor forms increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Interestingly, co-expression of the Tie-2 receptors with STAT1 resulted in appearance of a novel, p21 related transcript. Taken together, these findings identify STAT proteins as novel targets for signal transduction by the endothelial RTKs, suggesting that they may be involved in the regulation of endothelial function.",

The GLB1 gene gives rise to the GLB1 lysosomal enzyme and to the elastin binding protein (EBP), involved in elastic fiber deposition. GLB1 forms a complex with protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA), alpha neuraminidase (NEU1), and galactosamine 6-sulphate sulfatase (GALNS) inside lysosomes, while EBP binds to PPCA and NEU1 on the cell surface. We investigated the function of the GLB1 and EBP mutated proteins by analyzing the clinical, genetic, and cellular data of 11 G(M1)-gangliosidosis patients. Their molecular analysis, followed by expression studies, lead to the identification of four new and 10 known GLB1 mutations. Some common amino acid substitutions [c.1445G>A (p.Arg482H), c.622C>T (p.Arg208His), c.175C>T (p.Arg59Cys) and c.176G>A (p.Arg59His)] were present in the GLB1 enzyme of several patients, all of Mediterranean origin, suggesting a common origin. Western blotting analyses against GLB1, EBP, and PPCA proteins showed that the identified mutations affect GLB1 enzyme activity and/or stability. The c.1445G>A (p.Arg482His), c.175C>T (p.Arg59Cys), c.733+2T>C, c.1736G>A (p.Gly579Asp), and c.1051C>T (p.Arg351X) GLB1 mutations, affect the stabilization of PPCA probably because they hamper the interaction between GLB1/EBP and PPCA within the multiprotein complex. The amount of EBP was normal, but the detection of impaired elastogenesis in such patients suggests an alteration in its function. We conclude that the presence of genetic lesions in both GLB1 and EBP coding region does not directly predict impaired elastogenesis and that elastic fiber assembly has to be evaluated specifically in each case. Nevertheless, the degree of EBP involvement may be linked to specific clinical findings.",

MDMX has been shown to counteract MDM2-dependent p53 degradation and to stabilize p53 in its inactive form. In this study: we identify two MDMX proteolytic pathways that control its intracellular levels, and show that MDMX post-translational processing may be regulated by p53. Mouse MDMX is cleaved in vitro and in vivo by caspase activity, between aminoacids 358 and 361, producing a p54 minor form. In addition, MDMX is subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation, which concurs to MDMX proteolysis mainly through degradation of p54. A D361A-MDMX mutant, resistant to caspase cleavage, exhibits prolonged intracellular lifetime in comparison to wild-type protein, indicating that caspase cleavage affects stability of MDMX protein probably by modulating its further degradation. Overexpression of exogenous p53 increases the intracellular levels of p54 product. Similarly, activation of endogenous p53 by adriamycin enhances MDMX cleavage and produces a marked decrease of its intracellular levels, while not affecting the D361A-MDMX mutant. In addition, the D361A-MDMX mutant lacks the ability to inhibit p53 transactivation in respect to wild-type MDMX, suggesting that MDMX caspase cleavage play an important functional role. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that, in analogy to MDM2, MDMX may be subjected to proteolytic modifications that regulate its intracellular levels. Moreover, decrease of MDMX protein levels following p53 activation suggests a p53-dependent regulatory feedback of MDMX function.",

Herein, we report binding constants and stoichiometry under near-physiological conditions for the binding of Cu(II) to human alpha-synuclein. Specifically, we compare the binding of Cu(II) to wild-type (WT) protein and two separate single mutation proteins that are associated with familial Parkinson's diseases: A30P and A53T. Cu(II) binds to all three alpha-synuclein proteins with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The Cu(II) binding constants, however, vary among the proteins studied. Cu(II) binding to WT and A53T at 37 degrees C is similar with a pH-dependent binding constant (K) of approximately 2.4 x 10(9) and approximately 4.8 x 10(9) M(-1) at pH 7.2 and 7.4, respectively. Cu(II) binding to A30P, however, exhibits two binding constants. The major binding site of A30P, characteristic of >90% of the bound Cu(II), has binding constants of 1.6 x 10(9) and 3.6 x 10(9) M(-1) at pH 7.2 and 7.4, respectively, slightly lower ( approximately 70%) than that characteristic of WT or A53T at the corresponding pH. The second less populated binding exhibited by A30P has a large binding constant, approximately 10(10) M(-1). Our size exclusion analysis ruled out the contribution of protofibrils to the strong Cu(II) binding. Previous studies indicated that A30P had a larger proportion of intermediate species (e.g., small oligomeric species, such as dimers and trimers) relative to WT and A53T. Thus, we propose that the high affinity site is attributed to the binding of Cu(II) to those small oligomeric species.",

Here we show that Cbl associates with all three forms of the human Crk protein, predominantly CrkL, following T cell receptor activation of Jurkat T cells. Association between Cbl and Crk proteins was confirmed in normal human peripheral blood-derived T cells. In vitro, Cbl was able to interact with the Crk SH2 domain but not the SH3 domain. A phosphopeptide corresponding to a potential Crk SH2 domain-binding motif in Cbl (pYDVP) specifically inhibited binding between Cbl and Crk SH2 domain. Anti-Cbl antibody completely immunodepleted the CrkL-associated 120kDa phosphotyrosyl polypeptide, suggesting that the recently described p130cas-related Crk-associated p116 of T cells may be Cbl. Consistent with this possibility, the 4F4 antibody used to characterize the p116 polypeptide cross-reacted with Cbl protein when it was resolved on one- or two-dimensional gels. CrkL was constitutively associated with a substantial amount of the guanine nucleotide exchange protein C3G, and a fraction of the C3G protein was coimmunoprecipitated with Cbl in activated Jurkat T cells. These results suggest the possibility that Cbl may participate in a signaling pathway that regulates guanine nucleotide exchange on small G-proteins in T cells.",

Mutant receptors generated by site-directed mutagenesis were expressed in transfected NIH 3T3 cells lacking endogenous receptors. After coincubation of cell lysates in the presence or absence of EGF, receptor immunoprecipitates were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. A kinase-negative mutant EGFR (K721A), in which Lys-721 in the ATp binding site was replaced by an alanine residue, was shown to be phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner by an enzymatically active EGFR deletion mutant lacking two autophosphorylation sites. A mutant EGFR lacking the EGF-binding domain as well as the phosphorylation sites also phosphorylated the kinase-negative mutant. In both cases the kinase-negative mutant K721A was phosphorylated on sites virtually identical to the sites that are autophosphorylated by wild-type recombinant or native human EGFRs. With four different site-specific anti-EGFR antibodies, it was shown that deletion mutants devoid of epitopes recognized by the antibodies were coimmunoprecipitated together with wild-type or mutant receptors recognized by the antibodies. This indicates that EGFR oligomers were preserved during immunoprecipitation. On the basis of these results, we propose that autophosphorylation of solubilized EGFR is mediated by intermolecular cross-phosphorylation, probably facilitated by receptor oligomerization.",

Here we show that cells overproducing a mutant form of ezrin in which Tyr-353 was changed to a phenylalanine (Y353F) undergo apoptosis when assayed for tubulogenesis. While investigating the mechanism responsible for this apoptosis, we found that ezrin interacts with p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Two distinct sites of ezrin are involved in this interaction, the amino-terminal domain containing the first 309 aa and the phosphorylated Tyr-353 residue, which binds to the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Cells producing Y353F ezrin are defective in activation of the protein kinase Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase that protects cells against apoptosis. Furthermore, the apoptotic phenotype of these cells is rescued by production of a constitutively activated form of PI 3-kinase. Taken together, these results establish a novel function for ezrin in determining survival of epithelial cells by activating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway.",

However, there are conflicting reports describing the capacity of the A1 domain to interact with collagen types I and III. METHODS: In this study, we have used recombinant VWF-A1 polypeptides, as well as conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb), to analyze the A1-collagen interaction. RESULTS: The A1 domain bound to collagen with K(d) approximately 8.0 nm and this binding was blocked by the mAb 6G1, which blocks the interaction between ristocetin and VWF. In addition, collagen-bound A1 protein was able to support flow-dependent adhesion of platelets, demonstrating that the binding sites for collagen and glycoprotein (GP)Ib are different. Analysis with two conformation-specific mAb demonstrated that the structure of the A1 domain changed as a result of the binding to collagen. In contrast, the antibodies failed to detect conformational change in the G1324S mutant (type 2M von Willebrand disease). Thus, direct binding to collagen induces a change in the structural conformation within the VWF-A1 domain, and the G1324S substitution prevents this conformational change. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the isolated A1 domain can simultaneously bind to collagen and platelet GPIb, supporting platelet adhesion under high-flow conditions. In addition, this study has used mAb to demonstrate that the binding of the isolated A1 domain or full-length VWF to collagen is accompanied by a conformational change in A1 domain.",

It consists of the transmembrane IICMan.IIDMan complex and the cytoplasmic IIABMan subunit. IIABMan has two domains (IIA and IIB) that are linked by a 60-A long alanine-proline-rich linker. IIABMan transfers phosphoryl groups from the phospho-histidine-containing phospho-carrier protein of the PTS to His-10 on IIA, hence to His-175 on IIB, and finally to the 6'-OH of the transported hexose. IIABMan occurs as a stable homodimer. The subunit contact is mediated by a swap of beta-strands and an extensive contact area between the IIA domains. The H10C and H175C single and the H10C/H175C double mutants were used to characterize the phosphoryl transfer between IIA to IIB. Subunits do not exchange between dimers under physiological conditions, but slow phosphoryl transfer can take place between subunits from different dimers. Heterodimers of different subunits were produced in vitro by GuHCl-induced unfolding and refolding of mixtures of two different homodimers. With respect to wild-type homodimers, the heterodimers have the following activities: wild-type.H10C, 50%; wild-type.H175C 45%; H10C.H175C, 37%; and wild-type.H10C/H175C (double mutant), 29%. Taken together, this indicates that both cis and trans pathways contribute to the maximal phosphotransferase activity of IIABMan. A phosphoryl group on a IIA domain can be transferred either to the IIB domain on the same or on the second subunit in the dimer, and interruption of one of the two pathways results in a reduction of the activity to 70-80% of the control.",

The AGM and NIH/Swiss mouse CCR5 proteins are 97.7 to 98.3% and 79.8% identical to the human protein, respectively. In addition, we analyzed site-directed mutants and chimeras of these CCR5s. Cell surface expression of CCR5 proteins was monitored by using a specific rabbit antiserum and by binding the chemokine [125I]Mip1beta. Our major results were as follows. (i) Two distinct AGM CCR5 sequences were reproducibly found in DNA from CV-1 cells. The AGM clone 1 CCR5 protein differs from that of clone 2 by two substitutions, Y14N in the amino-terminal extracellular region and L352F at the carboxyl terminus. Interestingly, AGM clone 1 CCR5 was inactive as a coreceptor for all tested macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1, whereas AGM clone 2 CCR5 was active. As shown by chimera studies and site-directed mutagenesis, the Y14N substitution in AGM clone 1 CCR5 was solely responsible for blocking HIV-1 infections. In contrast, both AGM CCR5 clones were active coreceptors for SIVmac251. Studies of DNA samples from other AGMs indicated frequent additional CCR5 polymorphisms, and we cloned an AGM clone 2 variant with a Q93R substitution in the extracellular loop 1 from one heterozygote. This variant CCR5 was active as a coreceptor for SIVmac251 but was only weakly active for macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1. In addition, SIVmac251 appeared to be dependent on the extracellular amino terminus and loop 2 regions of human CCR5 for maximal infection. Our results suggest major differences in the interactions of SIVmac251 and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates with 19, N13, and Y14 in the amino terminus; with Q93 in extracellular loop 1; and with extracellular loop 2 of human CCR5. (ii) The NIH/Swiss mouse CCR5 protein differs at multiple positions from sequences recently reported for other inbred strains of mice. This CCR5 was inactive as a coreceptor for HIV-1 and SIVmac251. Studies of chimeras that contained different portions of NIH/Swiss mouse CCR5 substituted into human CCR5, as well as the reciprocal chimeras, indicated that the amino-terminal region and extracellular loops 1 and 2 of human CCR5 contribute to its coreceptor activity for macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1. Specific differences with previous CCR5 chimera results occurred because the NIH/Swiss mouse CCR5 contains a unique substitution corresponding to P183L in extracellular loop 2 that is nonpermissive for coreceptor activity. We conclude that diverse CCR5 sequences occur in AGMs and mice, that SIVmac251 and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates interact differently with specific CCR5 amino acids, and that multiple regions of human CCR5 contribute to its coreceptor functions. In addition, we have identified naturally occurring amino acid polymorphisms in three extracellular regions of CCR5 (Y14N, Q93R, and P183L) that do not interfere with cell surface expression or Mip1beta binding but prevent infections by macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1. In contrast to previous evidence, these results suggest that CCR5 contains critical sites that are essential for HIV-1 infections.",

Blocking this interaction represents a promising approach to the treatment of arterial thrombosis. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the VWF A1 domain in several species, expressing VWF recognized by the blocking monoclonal antibody AJvW-2, suggested 9 residues (His563, Ile566, Asp570, Ala581, Val584, Ala587, Arg616, Ala618, and Met622) to contribute to the epitope for AJvW-2 or to be part of the GPIbalpha-binding site. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-human VWF A1 fusion proteins, in which these amino acids were mutated to their murine counterparts, were tested for their capacity to bind AJvW-2 or heparin, to interfere with botrocetin- or ristocetin-mediated VWF binding to GPIb, or to induce flow-dependent platelet tethering in a perfusion chamber. Thus, mutations His563Arg, Ile566Leu, Asp570Ala, and Ala587Thr, clustered on the outer surface of the A1 domain, dramatically impaired binding of AJvW-2 to A1. The His563Arg, Ile566Leu, and Asp570Ala mutations also impaired the binding of heparin, which competes with AJvW-2 for binding to A1. Perfusion studies revealed that His563, Ile566, Asp570, Arg616, and Ala618 take part in GPIbalpha binding, their mutation-impairing platelet recruitment. In agreement with the surface distribution of VWF type 2M mutations, this study demonstrates overlapping of the epitope for AJvW-2 and the GPIbalpha-binding site, located around the front pocket of the A1 domain and defined by strands beta3, beta4, and helix alpha3, and it provides a mechanistic basis for VWF neutralization by this antibody.",

The molecular basis of the condition has been ascribed to inactivating mutations in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to present three new cases caused by a novel mutation in the hGR gene and to delineate the molecular mechanisms through which the mutant receptor impairs glucocorticoid signal transduction. DESIGN AND RESULTS: The index case (father) and his two daughters presented with increased urinary free cortisol excretion and resistance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to dexamethasone suppression in the absence of clinical manifestations suggestive of Cushing syndrome. All subjects harbored a novel, heterozygous, point mutation (T\u2192G) at nucleotide position 1724 of the hGR gene, which resulted in substitution of valine by glycine at amino acid 575 of the receptor. Compared with the wild-type receptor, the hGR\u03b1V575G demonstrated a significant (33%) reduction in its ability to transactivate the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in response to dexamethasone, a 50% decrease in its affinity for the ligand, and a 2.5-fold delay in nuclear translocation. Although it did not exert a dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor and preserved its ability to bind to DNA, hGR\u03b1V575G displayed significantly enhanced (\u223c80%) ability to transrepress the nuclear factor-\u03ba\u0392 signaling pathway. Finally, the mutant receptor hGR\u03b1V575G demonstrated impaired interaction with the LXXLL motif of the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 coactivator in vitro and in computer-based structural simulation via its defective activation function-2 (AF-2) domain. CONCLUSIONS: The natural mutant receptor hGR\u03b1V575G causes primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance by affecting multiple steps in the glucocorticoid signaling cascade, including the affinity for the ligand, the time required for nuclear translocation, and the interaction with the glucocorticoid-interacting protein-1 coactivator.",

Electron microscopy revealed that these complexes accumulated in the perinuclear area and consisted of highly ordered fibrillary structures. A similar MxA-mediated redistribution of viral nucleocapsid proteins was detected with other bunyaviruses, such as Bunyamwera virus and Rift Valley fever virus. MxA(E645R), a carboxy-terminal mutant of MxA without antiviral activity against LACV, did not lead to complex formation. Wild-type MxA, but not MxA(E645R), was able to bind to LACV nucleocapsid protein in coimmunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating the importance of the carboxy-terminal effector domain of MxA.

Corresponding peptides not only disrupt G(betagamma)-G(alpha) interactions, as defined by G(betagamma)-stimulated GTPase activity of alpha(o), but also other G(betagamma)-mediated functions. The NMR structure of a peptide encompassing this region shows a loop exposing the side chains of Glu223 and Tyr224, and peptides with a substitution of either of these amino acids show a complete loss of activity towards G(o). Mutation of this Tyr224 to Ala in full-length phosducin reduced the functional activity of phosducin to that of phosducin's isolated N-terminus, indicating the importance of this residue within the short, structurally defined C-terminal segment.

We found that the mechanism of this inhibition by both peptides is different 125I-labeled 214-218 peptide binds to alpha IIb beta 3 but in contrast, 125I-labeled 217-231 peptide binds to the A alpha-chain of native and gamma' fibrinogen, as judged by the cross-linking study. In solid phase assay both purified alpha IIb beta 3 and 217-231 peptide bound extensively to native and recombinant fibrinogen, and to fibrinogen with either D574E or D97E mutations in the A alpha-chain. Binding of purified alpha IIb beta 3 to gamma' fibrinogen was markedly impaired whereas binding of 217-231 was only slightly impaired in comparison with native fibrinogen. Binding of 217-231 to fibrinogen fragment X was also reduced suggesting that sequences other than RGDS and RGDF may represent binding sites for this peptide.

There are two distinct but partially overlapping regions of GP Ib alpha thought to be involved in interacting with vWF (residues 251-279) and alpha-thrombin (residues 271-284); they share three tyrosine residues (positions 276, 278, and 279) that have recently been shown to be sulfated (Dong, J., Li, C. Q., and Lopez, J.A. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 13946-13953). To define the functional role of these three residues, we have introduced selected mutations in a soluble recombinant GP Ib alpha fragment (corresponding to the sequence 1-302 of the mature protein) that binds vWF and alpha-thrombin with the same attributes as intact GP Ib-IX-V complex. Fragments containing a single Tyr-->Phe substitution either at position 276 or 278 or 279 exhibited normal interaction with vWF but markedly reduced or absent binding of alpha-thrombin. GP Ib alpha fragment with normal sequence but synthesized under sulfate-free conditions also failed to bind alpha-thrombin and, in addition, had markedly reduced interaction with vWF. The simultaneous substitution of three neighboring Asp residues with Asn at positions 272, 274, and 277, a multiple mutation that may impair Tyr sulfation, also resulted in loss of binding of both ligands.

Pathogenic hantaviruses [New York-1 virus (NY-1V) and Hantaan virus (HTNV)] bind immobilized beta3 polypeptides containing the PSI domain, and human (but not murine) beta3 polypeptides inhibit hantavirus infectivity. Substitution of human beta3 residues 1-39 for murine beta3 residues directed pathogenic hantavirus infection of nonpermissive CHO cells expressing chimeric alphavbeta3 receptors. Mutation of murine beta3 Asn-39 to Asp-39 present in human beta3 homologues (N39D) permitted hantavirus infection of cells and specified PSI domain residue interactions with pathogenic hantaviruses. In addition, cell-surface expression of alphavbeta3 locked in an inactive bent conformation conferred hantavirus infectivity of CHO cells. Our findings indicate that hantaviruses bind to a unique domain exposed on inactive integrins and, together with prior findings, suggest that this interaction restricts alphavbeta3 functions that regulate vascular permeability.

The transactivation and coactivation functions of Zac1 may occur at non-promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) sites in the presence of other PML-NB components, including ubiquitin-conjugating 9 (Ubc9). It is unclear whether post-translational modification of Zac1 by the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO plays a role in the coactivation functions of Zac1 for the regulation of the p21 gene. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that the two SUMO-binding lysine residues of Zac1, K237 and K424, repress the transactivation activity of Zac1. Studies using a SUMO-1 C-terminal di-glycine motif mutant that is deficient in the ability to form covalent bonds with lysines, SUMO-1 (GA), and a dominant-negative Ubc9 construct (C93S) indicated that SUMO-1 might regulate Zac1 transactivation and coactivation via a non-covalent interaction. Unlike the wild-type Zac1, which induced apoptosis, the Zac1 (K237/424R) double mutant had the ability to induce autophagy. The functional role of p21 remains to be investigated. SUMO-1 selectively suppressed the induction of the p21 gene and protein by wild-type Zac1 but not by the Zac1 (K237/424R) double mutant. Moreover, wild-type Ubc9 but not Ubc9 (C93S) further potentiated the suppression of SUMO-1 in all Zac1-induced p21 promoter activities. Our data reveal that p21 may be an important factor for the prevention of Zac1-induced apoptosis without affecting autophagosome formation. This work indicates that Zac1 functions are regulated, at least in part, via non-covalent interactions with SUMO-1 for the induction of p21, which is important for the modulation of apoptosis.",

Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that endogenous PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at serine 65, homologous to the site phosphorylated by PINK1 in Parkin's ubiquitin-like domain. Recombinant TcPINK1 directly phosphorylated ubiquitin and phospho-ubiquitin activated Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in cell-free assays. In cells, the phosphomimetic ubiquitin mutant S65D bound and activated Parkin.

In wild-type B-Raf (B-Raf(wt)), activation segment phosphorylation is thought to cooperate with negative charges within the N-region for full activation. In contrast to Raf-1, the N-region of B-Raf is constitutively negatively charged owing to the presence of residues D447/D448 and the phosphorylation of S446. Therefore, it has been suggested that this hallmark predisposes B-Raf for oncogenic activation. In this study, we demonstrate that neutralizing mutations of these residues (in particular S446 and S447), or uncoupling of B-Raf from Ras-guanine 5'-triphosphate (GTP), strongly reduce the biological activity of B-Raf in a PC12 cell differentiation assay. We also confirm that S365 is a 14-3-3 binding site, and determine that mutation of this residue rescues the impaired biological activity of B-Raf proteins with a neutralized N-region, suggesting that the N-region opposes a 14-3-3-mediated transition into an inactive conformation. However, in the case of B-Raf(V600E), although complete N-region neutralization resulted in a 2.5-fold reduction in kinase activity in vitro, this oncoprotein strongly induced PC12 differentiation or transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of MCF-10A cells regardless of its N-region charge. Furthermore, the biological activity of B-Raf(V600E) was independent of its ability to bind Ras-GTP. Our analysis identifies important regulatory differences between B-Raf(wt) and B-Raf(V600E) and suggests that B-Raf(V600E) cannot be inhibited by strategies aimed at blocking S446 phosphorylation or Ras activation.",

In primary leukemic neutrophils from patients with CML, the major tyrosine phosphorylated protein is CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 adapter protein which has an overall homology of 60% to CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene. In cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, CRKL was tyrosine phosphorylated, while CRK was not. We looked for changes in CRK- and CRKL-binding proteins in Ba/F3 hematopoietic cell lines which were transformed by BCR/ABL. Anti-CRK II or anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates were probed by far Western blotting with CRK II- or CRKL-GST fusion proteins to display CRK- and CRKL-coprecipitating proteins. There was a striking qualitative difference in the proteins coprecipitating with CRKL and CRK II. In untransformed cells, three major proteins coprecipitated with CRKL, identified as C3G, SOS and c-ABL. Each of these proteins was found to interact with the CRKL-SH3 domains, but not the SH2 domain. After BCR/ABL transformation, the CRKL SH3-domain binding proteins did not change, with the exception that BCR/ABL now coprecipitated with CRKL. Compared to CRKL, very few proteins coprecipitated with CRK II in untransformed, quiescent cells. After BCR/ABL transformation, both the CRKL- and CRK-SH2 domains bound to a new complex of proteins of approximate molecular weight 105-120 kDa. The major protein in this complex was identified as p120CBL. Thus, in these hematopoietic cell lines, CRKL is involved to a greater extent than CRK II in normal signaling pathways that involve c-ABL, C3G and SOS. In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, CRKL but not CRK II, appears to form complexes which potentially link BCR/ABL, c-ABL, C3G, and SOS to the protooncoprotein, p120CBL.",

IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.",

Furthermore, Crk SH2 and SH3 domains formed ligand-independent complexes with Shc, C3G, and the Crk-associated substrate (Cas). Tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and Cas increased as a consequence of growth factor treatment. We examined the role of Crk in FGFR-1-mediated cellular responses by use of cells expressing chimeric platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha/FGFR-1 (alphaR/FR) wild type and mutant Y463F receptors. The kinase activity of alphaR/FR Y463F was intact, but both Crk and the adaptor FRS-2 were no longer tyrosine-phosphorylated in the mutant cells. Both wild type and mutant receptor cells migrated efficiently, whereas cells expressing the mutant alphaR/FR Y463F failed to proliferate and Erk2 and Jun kinase activities were suppressed in these cells. In wild type alphaR/FR cells transiently expressing an SH2 domain mutant of Crk, Erk and Jun kinase activities as well as DNA synthesis were attenuated.

Western blot analysis shows both mutants to be properly expressed but not processed to form gp120 and gp41, which explains their nonfunctionality. The presence of mutant gp160 on the cell surface, as well as their ability to bind to sCD4, suggests that the mutations have disrupted processing at the furin recognition site encoded within the gp120 conserved domain 5, without resulting in an overall misfolding of the protein. With respect to the furin recognition site, the mutations are sequentially distant, which implies that the gp41 disulfide loop is interacting with gp120 C5 in gp160. In addition, we have modeled the gp120-gp41 interaction in unprocessed precursor gp160 using structural data available for gp120 and gp41 domains in isolation, supplemented by mutagenesis data. We suggest that the mutations have altered the interaction between gp120 C5 and the gp41 disulfide loop, resulting in decreased accessibility of the furin recognition site and implying that the interaction between the gp120 C5 and gp41 loop is a conformational requirement for gp160 processing. The sensitivity of this interaction could be exploited in future antivirals designed to disrupt HIV pathogenesis by disrupting gp160 processing.",

To investigate the mechanism of stimulation we have explored protein-protein interactions between the POU domain and the pTP-pol complex. Such an interaction could be detected using a GST-POU fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Binding was also observed with the POU homeodomain (POUHD), albeit weaker than with the intact POU domain, but not with the POU specific subdomain. Four point mutations localized in the POUHD were analyzed for pTP-pol binding. Two of these, E22A and E30A, bound pTP-pol equally as well as the wild-type, while the other two, Q24A and E29A, were able to bind 2- to 4-fold better. These mutations are localized in the same region where the HSV transactivator VP16 binds, but did not coincide with the VP16 contacts. A direct correlation between pTP-pol binding and stimulation of DNA replication in vitro was observed for all mutants, suggesting that stimulation by the POU domain is caused by an interaction with the viral pTP-pol complex.",

We have now investigated this interaction in more detail and have found, based on both blotting studies with glutathione S-transferase-p85-SH2 fusion proteins and binding of these fusion proteins to SDS-denatured EpRs, that this binding is direct. Moreover, both in vitro competition studies, involving phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequences flanking the eight tyrosines within the intracellular domain of the EpR, and in vivo studies with mutant EpRs bearing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions, indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr503 within the EpR is essential for the binding of PI 3-kinase. The presence of PI 3-kinase activity in EpR immunoprecipitates from DA-3 cells infected with wild-type but not Y503F EpRs confirms this finding. Our results demonstrate that the SH2 domains of p85 can bind, in addition to their well established Tyr-Met/Val-X-Met consensus binding sequence, a Tyr-Val-Ala-Cys motif that is present in the EpR. A comparison of erythropoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylations and proliferation of wild-type and Y503F EpR-infected DA-3 cells revealed no differences. However, the PI-3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, markedly inhibited the erythropoietin-induced proliferation of both cell types, suggesting that PI 3-kinase is activated in Y503F EpR expressing cells. This was confirmed by carrying out PI 3-kinase assays with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from erythropoietin-stimulated Y503F EpR-infected DA-3 cells and suggested that PI 3-kinase has a role in regulating erythropoietin-induced proliferation, but at a site distinct from the EpR.",

          "text": "Neurotrophins (NTs) are growth factors that are critical in regulating structural, synaptic, and morphological plasticity and in modulating the strength and number of synaptic connections and neurotransmission (Thoenen, 2000). In addition, the role of NTs in the adult central nervous system is important because they participate in the maintenance of neuronal functions, the structural integrity of neurons, and neurogenesis (Cooper et al., 1996), suggesting their biological role during the entire life span. NTs are homodimeric proteins and are categorized into four different classes: nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NT-3, and NT-4/5. Most functions of NTs are mediated by the tropomycin receptor kinase (Trk) family of tyrosine kinase receptors. The interaction of NTs with the Trk receptors is specific: nerve growth factor binds with TrkA, BDNF and NT-4 both bind to TrkB, and NT-3 binds to TrkC with the highest affinity but can also bind and mediate its actions via TrkA and TrkB receptors. All NTs can bind to the pan75 NT receptor (p75(NTR)), which plays a role in NT transport, ligand-binding specificity, and Trk functioning (Barbacid, 1994, 1995; Lewin and Barde, 1996; Schweigreiter, 2006). In addition to the full-length TrkB receptor, several noncatalytic truncated TrkB isoforms have also been identified; these isoforms lack the signaling domain, preventing the induction of a signal transduction mechanism. Binding of an NT to the appropriate Trk receptor leads to the dimerization and transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the Trk receptors and subsequent activation of signaling pathways (Chao et al., 2006; Reichardt, 2006), leading to altered transcription of critical genes. The most widely distributed member of NT family is BDNF (Huang and Reichardt, 2001). The BDNF gene lies on chromosome 11p13 and encodes pro-BDNF, a precursor peptide of mature BDNF (Seidah et al., 1996). BDNF is translated as 30\u201335 kDa preproproteins consisting of a preprodomain, a prodomain, and a C-terminal mature NT domain. BDNF levels and its intracellular localization in neurons are regulated via several different mechanisms, including BDNF transcripts, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein transport, and regulated cleavage of pro-BDNF to mature BDNF. The pro-BDNF is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is accumulated in the trans-Golgi network via the Golgi apparatus. Pro-BDNF can be cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum by furin or in the regulated secretary vesicles by proconvertase enzymes. Pro-BDNF binds to sortilin, an intracellular chaperone that binds to the prodomain of BDNF to traffic it to the regulated secretory pathway, in the Golgi apparatus. This facilitates the correct folding of the mature BDNF domain. The mature domain of BDNF binds to carboxypeptidase E, thereby sorting BDNF to the regulated secretary pathway (Lu et al., 2005). Pro-BDNF can also be processed by serine protease plasmin when pro-BDNF is in the extracellular milieu (Pang et al., 2004). A substitution of valine (Val) to methionine (Met) at codon 66 in the prodomain impairs this sorting of BDNF (Egan et al., 2003). The impact of a BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has been widely studied in relation to the clinical characteristics of suicidal behavior (Zai et al., 2011).",

In the present study, to address this issue, a series of point mutants in VDR helix 12 were generated to test the functional association. Alanine replacement of VDR valine 418 resulted in loss of DRIP205 interaction, but it was still transcriptionally potent with ability to interact with TIF2. Surprisingly, the V421A mutant was only partially impaired in transactivation without co-activator interaction, implying presence of a putative co-activator/complex.

We identify four S/TP sites of B-Raf phosphorylated by activated ERK and find that feedback phosphorylation of B-Raf inhibits binding to activated Ras and disrupts heterodimerization with C-Raf, which is dependent on the B-Raf pS729/14-3-3 binding site. Moreover, we find that events influencing Raf heterodimerization can alter the transforming potential of oncogenic B-Raf proteins possessing intermediate or impaired kinase activity but have no significant effect on proteins with high kinase activity, such as V600E B-Raf. Mutation of the feedback sites or overexpression of the Pin1 prolyl-isomerase, which facilitates B-Raf dephosphorylation/recycling, resulted in increased transformation, whereas mutation of the S729/14-3-3 binding site or expression of dominant negative Pin1 reduced transformation. Mutation of each feedback site caused increased transformation and correlated with enhanced heterodimerization and activation of C-Raf. Finally, we find that B-Raf and C-Raf proteins containing mutations identified in certain developmental disorders constitutively heterodimerize and that their signaling activity can also be modulated by feedback phosphorylation.",

When cultured mast cells (CMCs) are cocultured with fibroblasts expressing membrane-bound SCF, CMCs with normal KIT adhere to fibroblasts and proliferate, whereas CMCs lacking cell surface expression of KIT do neither. Spermatogenic immunoglobulin superfamily (SgIGSF) was identified as another molecule that participates in mast cell adhesion to fibroblasts. Since the IC-2 mast cell line expressed neither KIT nor SgIGSF, the effect of ectopic expression of KIT or SgIGSF on the adhesion of IC-2 cells was examined. Three forms of KIT with the normal ectodomain were used: wild-type (KIT-WT) and two mutant types with a phenylalanine substitution at the tyrosine residue 719 (KIT-Y719F) or 821 (KIT-Y821F). KIT-Y719F does not activate PI3-K, whereas KIT-Y821F does. Firstly, KIT or SgIGSF was expressed singly in IC-2 cells. All three forms of KIT increased the adhesion level of IC-2 cells, whereas SgIGSF did not. Secondly, SgIGSF was coexpressed with one of the three forms of KIT. Coexpression of SgIGSF with KIT-WT or KIT-Y821F increased the adhesion level more markedly than was achieved by KIT-WT or KIT-Y821F alone. The effect was abolished by an antibody that blocks SCF-KIT interaction. In contrast, coexpression of SgIGSF with KIT-Y719F did not increase the adhesion level induced by KIT-Y719F alone. In adhesion of mast cells to fibroblasts, KIT appeared to behave as an adhesion molecule and as an activator of other adhesion molecules through phosphorylating PI3-K.",

In this study, we have characterized the effect of four E-cadherin germline missense mutations (T340A, A634V, P799R and V832M) in the interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We challenged the hypothesis that E-cadherin mutations perturb its ability to bind to EGFR, leading to constitutional activation of the EGFR, triggering activation of downstream effectors. We verified that missense mutations localized in the extracellular domain of the protein (T340A and A634V) exhibited reduced stability of the EGFR/E-cadherin heterodimers in contrast to germline mutations localized at the cytoplasmatic domain of the protein (P799R and V832M). We observed that cells expressing E-cadherin extracellular mutants displayed increased levels of phosphorylated EGFR upon ligand stimulation, when compared with cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin or intracellular mutants. We showed that upon treatment of E-cadherin extracellular mutant cells with the EGFR inhibitor, the increase of RhoA activation is abrogated and accompanied by decreased migratory behaviour, supporting the idea that Rho-like proteins are EGFR downstream effectors. Our results bring new insights into the understanding of the distinct in vitro behaviours observed for E-cadherin missense mutations localized in different domains of the protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E-cadherin-dependent EGFR activation contributes to enhanced cell motility, in a mechanism involving RhoA activation.",

Overexpression of this kinase has been associated with the development of Down syndrome in both human and animal models, whereas single copy loss-of-function of DYRK1A leads to increased apoptosis and decreased brain size. Although more than a dozen of DYRK1A targets have been identified, the molecular basis of its involvement in neuronal development remains unclear. Here we show that DYRK1A and another pro-survival member of the DYRK family, DYRK3, promote cell survival through phosphorylation and activation of SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase that is essential in a variety of physiological processes including stress response and energy metabolism. DYRK1A and DYRK3 directly phosphorylate SIRT1 at Thr(522), promoting deacetylation of p53. A SIRT1 phosphorylation mimetic (SIRT1 T522D) displays elevated deacetylase activity, thus inhibiting cell apoptosis. Conversely, a SIRT1 dephosphorylation mimetic (SIRT1 T522V) fails to mediate DYRK-induced deacetylation of p53 and cell survival. We show that knockdown of endogenous DYRK1A and DYRK3 leads to hypophosphorylation of SIRT1, sensitizing cells to DNA damage-induced cell death. We also provide evidence that phosphorylation of Thr(522) activates SIRT1 by promoting product release, thereby increasing its enzymatic turnover. Taken together, our findings provide a novel mechanism by which two anti-apoptotic DYRK members promote cell survival through direct modification of SIRT1. These findings may have important implications in understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis, Down syndrome, and aging.",

To compare KIGal80p and ScGal80p, point mutations known to affect ScGal80p function were introduced at corresponding positions in KIGal80p, and Gal4p regulation in vivo and KIGal80p-binding to Gst-Gal1p and Gst-Gal4-AD in vitro were analysed. The in vitro binding properties of the KIGal80p mutants were similar to those of ScGal80p, but two out of four mutants differed in Gal4p regulation. E. g. KIGAL80s-0(G302R) but not ScGAL80s-0 (G301R) alleviates Gal4p inhibition. Possibly, this difference is related to a role of phosphorylation in the regulation of Gal80p function in K. lactis. Wild-type and mutant forms of KIGal80p are shown to be subject to carbon source regulated phosphorylation whereas no evidence for ScGal80p phosphorylation exists. (Hyper-)phosphorylation of KIGal80p is strongly reduced in galactose-containing medium. This reduction requires KIGal1p but no interaction with KIGal4p. The inhibition deficient KIGal80s-0p (G302R) variant is under-phosphorylated. We thus propose that phosphorylation of Gal80p in Kluyveromyces lactis contributes to the regulation of Gal4p mediated transcription.",

Although it has been well established that such a gain of function is mainly achieved through interaction with transcriptional regulators, thereby modulating cancer-associated gene expression, how the mutp53 function is regulated remains elusive. Here we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) bound common mutp53 (e.g. R175H and R273H) and, subsequently, suppressed their oncogenic activities. ATF3 repressed mutp53-induced NFKB2 expression and sensitized R175H-expressing cancer cells to cisplatin and etoposide treatments. Moreover, ATF3 appeared to suppress R175H- and R273H-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion as a consequence of preventing the transcription factor p63 from inactivation by mutp53. Accordingly, ATF3 promoted the expression of the metastasis suppressor SHARP1 in mutp53-expressing cells. An ATF3 mutant devoid of the mutp53-binding domain failed to disrupt the mutp53-p63 binding and, thus, lost the activity to suppress mutp53-mediated migration, suggesting that ATF3 binds to mutp53 to suppress its oncogenic function. In line with these results, we found that down-regulation of ATF3 expression correlated with lymph node metastasis in TP53-mutated human lung cancer. We conclude that ATF3 can suppress mutp53 oncogenic function, thereby contributing to tumor suppression in TP53-mutated cancer.",

We previously have shown that KSHV-GPCR has oncogenic potential when overexpressed in fibroblasts and is responsible for the expression and secretion of VEGF through the regulation of different intracellular signaling pathways (A. Sodhi et al., Cancer Res., 60: 4873-4880, 2000; C. Bais et al., Nature, 391: 86-89, 1998). Here, we describe that this constitutively active G protein-coupled receptor is able to promote cell survival in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells and that this effect is independent of its ability to secrete VEGF because it is not prevented by the expression of antisense constructs for VEGF or the addition of VEGF-blocking antibodies. Instead we found that ectopic expression of KSHV-GPCR potently induces the kinase activity of Akt/protein kinase B in a dose-dependent manner and triggers its translocation to the plasma membrane. This signaling pathway requires the function of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and is dependent on betagamma subunits released from both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins. Furthermore, we found that KSHV-GPCR is able to protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells from the apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and that both wortmannin and the expression of a kinase-deficient Akt K179M mutant are able to block this effect. Finally, we observed that the Akt K179M protein also inhibits the activation of nuclear factor-KB induced by KSHV-GPCR, suggesting that this transcription factor may represent one of the putative downstream targets for Akt in the survival-signaling pathway. These results provide further knowledge in the elucidation of the signal transduction pathways activated by KSHV-GPCR and support its key role in promoting the survival of viral-infected cells. Moreover, the present findings also emphasize the importance of this G protein-coupled receptor in the development of KSHV-related neoplasias.",

We have examined the binding of Nlambda protein, peptides derived from the amino terminus of Nlambda, and the related phage P22 N protein to lambda boxB RNAs. To facilitate the study of complexes that are not amenable to gel retardation assays, a new polyacrylamide affinity coelectrophoresis technique (PACE) was developed. Using the PACE assay, we have demonstrated that a 19-amino acid peptide from the amino terminus of Nlambda protein binds lambda boxB RNA with a Kd,app of 5.2 nM. PACE was also used to study the binding affinity of a number of Nlambda peptide and lambda boxB RNA mutants. The PACE technique is complementary to the traditional gel retardation assay for direct measurement of binding interactions, and will be useful for any procedure that requires a pool of RNAs to be resolved based on their relative affinities for proteins or peptides.",

Expression of the mutant beta3Pro196 subunit in CHO cells, either associated with recombinant human alphaIIb or alphav, resulted in normal biosynthesis of beta3 and heterodimerization with alphav or alphaIIb, but selectively interfered with alphaIIbbeta3 maturation and transport to the cell surface. Functional analysis of the beta3 mutant receptors revealed strong inhibition of alphavbeta3-mediated cell spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, focal contact formation, p125FAK phosphorylation and fibrin clot retraction, as opposed to normal alphaIIbbeta3-mediated cell interaction with immobilized fibrinogen, focal contact translocation and signaling. In contrast, antibody- or DTT-activated mutant aIIbbeta3 was unable to bind soluble fibrinogen or the ligand mimetic PAC-1 monoclonal antibody, but underwent a conformational change following RGD peptide binding as demonstrated by AP5-LIBS epitope expression. These results suggest that (1) the highly conserved TL196T motif in the beta3 integrin subunit is located in a domain structurally important for the exposure of a functional binding site for soluble fibrinogen; and (2) that the MIDAS-like contact site in beta3 is not involved in alphaIIbbeta3-mediated cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, while it is essential for alphavbeta3-mediated interaction with this ligand.",

At the protein level, reversible phosphorylation plays an important role in modulating the activity of CK1delta. In the present study, we show that PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), Akt (protein kinase B), CLK2 (CDC-like kinase 2) and PKC (protein kinase C) alpha all phosphorylate CK1delta. PKA was identified as the major cellular CK1deltaCK (CK1delta C-terminal-targeted protein kinase) for the phosphorylation of CK1delta in vitro and in vivo. This was implied by the following evidence: PKA was detectable in the CK1deltaCK peak fraction of fractionated MiaPaCa-2 cell extracts, PKA shared nearly identical kinetic properties with those of CK1deltaCK, and both PKA and CK1deltaCK phosphorylated CK1delta at Ser370 in vitro. Furthermore, phosphorylation of CK1delta by PKA decreased substrate phosphorylation of CK1delta in vitro. Mutation of Ser370 to alanine increased the phosphorylation affinity of CK1delta for beta-casein and the GST (gluthatione S-transferase)-p53 1-64 fusion protein in vitro and enhanced the formation of an ectopic dorsal axis during Xenopus laevis development. Anchoring of PKA and CK1delta to centrosomes was mediated by AKAP (A-kinase-anchoring protein) 450. Interestingly, pre-incubation of MiaPaCa-2 cells with the synthetic peptide St-Ht31, which prevents binding between AKAP450 and the regulatory subunit RII of PKA, resulted in a 6-fold increase in the activity of CK1delta. In summary, we conclude that PKA phosphorylates CK1delta, predominantly at Ser370 in vitro and in vivo, and that site-specific phosphorylation of CK1delta by PKA plays an important role in modulating CK1delta-dependent processes.",

Interactions between alphaIIbbeta3 and two model ligands-echistatin, a 6-kDa recombinant protein with an RGD integrin-targeting sequence, and fibrinogen's gamma-module, a 30-kDa recombinant protein with a KQAGDV integrin binding site-were measured by sedimentation velocity, fluorescence anisotropy, and a solid-phase binding assay, and modeled by molecular graphics. Studying echistatin variants (R24A, R24K, D26A, D26E, D27W, D27F), we found that electrostatic contacts with charged residues at the alphaIIb/beta3 interface, rather than nonpolar contacts, perturb the conformation of the resting integrin. Aspartate 26, which interacts with the nearby MIDAS cation, was essential for binding, as D26A and D26E were inactive. In contrast, R24K was fully and R24A partly active, indicating that the positively charged arginine 24 contributes to, but is not required for, integrin recognition. Moreover, we demonstrated that priming--i.e., ectodomain conformational changes and oligomerization induced by incubation at 35 degrees C with the ligand-mimetic peptide cHarGD--promotes complex formation with fibrinogen's gamma-module. We also observed that the gamma-module's flexible carboxy terminus was not required for alphaIIbbeta3 integrin binding. Our studies differentiate priming ligands, which bind to the resting receptor and perturb its conformation, from regulated ligands, where binding-site remodeling must first occur. Echistatin's binding energy is sufficient to rearrange the subunit interface, but regulated ligands like fibrinogen must rely on priming to overcome conformational barriers.",

AChR deficiency is frequently due to homozygous or heteroallelic mutations in the AChR epsilon subunit, most of which cause truncation of the polypeptide chain and loss of surface expression of AChR. Here we identified mutations epsilon 1369delG and epsilon Y458X, located in the 18 amino acid epsilon subunit C-terminus that lies extracellular to the M4 transmembrane domain. We then incorporated green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the intracellular loop between M3 and M4 of mutant or wild-type epsilon subunits and expressed the AChRs in RD or HEK 293 cells. AChR containing wild-type GFP-tagged epsilon subunits were incorporated into the surface membrane, whereas the GFP-tagged AChR mutant epsilon subunits co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker and were not expressed on the cell surface. In addition, mutant AChRs did not reach the cell surface, as measured by labelling of intact cells with (125)I-alpha-bungarotoxin and precipitation with an epsilon-subunit-specific antiserum. Mutagenesis studies showed that cysteine 470, located four amino acids from the C-terminus, is essential for alpha/epsilon assembly and surface expression of adult AChR. Replacement of cysteine 470 by serine does not restore alpha/epsilon assembly or surface expression. Our results provide the first use of GFP-tagged AChR as a tool for investigation of CMS and demonstrate a previously undetermined role for a disulphide-bonded cystine in the epsilon subunit C-terminus, which plays a crucial role in expression of the adult AChR.",

The role of different autophosphorylation sites in FGFRs, and in particular the role of the tyrosine 766 in FGFR1, first identified as PLCgamma binding site, has been extensively studied. We analyzed here the possible role of the tyrosine 769 in KGFR, corresponding to tyrosine 766 in FGFR1, in the regulation of KGFR signal transduction and MAPK activation as well as in the control of the endocytic process of KGFR. A mutant KGFR in which tyrosine 769 was substituted by phenylalanine was generated and transfected in NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. Our results indicate that tyrosine 769 is required for the binding to KGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma as well as for the full activation of MAPKs and for cell proliferation through the regulation of FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that this residue represents a key regulator of KGFR signal transduction.

TMxA, a modified form of wild-type MxA carrying a foreign nuclear localization signal, accumulates in the cell nucleus. Here we show that MxA protein is translocated into the nucleus together with TMxA when both proteins are expressed simultaneously in the same cell, demonstrating that MxA molecules form tight complexes in living cells. To define domains important for MxA-MxA interaction and antiviral function in vivo, we expressed mutant forms of MxA together with wild-type MxA or TMxA in appropriate cells and analyzed subcellular localization and interfering effects. An MxA deletion mutant, MxA(359-572), formed heterooligomers with TMxA and was translocated to the nucleus, indicating that the region between amino acid positions 359 and 572 contains an interaction domain which is critical for oligomerization of MxA proteins. Mutant T103A with threonine at position 103 replaced by alanine had lost both GTPase and antiviral activities. T103A exhibited a dominant-interfering effect on the antiviral activity of wild-type MxA rendering MxA-expressing cells susceptible to infection with influenza A virus, Thogoto virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. To determine which sequences are critical for the dominant-negative effect of T103A, we expressed truncated forms of T103A together with wild-type protein. A C-terminal deletion mutant lacking the last 90 amino acids had lost interfering capacity, indicating that an intact C terminus was required. Surprisingly, a truncated version of MxA representing only the C-terminal half of the molecule exerted also a dominant-negative effect on wild-type function, demonstrating that sequences in the C-terminal moiety of MxA are necessary and sufficient for interference. However, all MxA mutants formed hetero-oligomers with TMxA and were translocated to the nucleus, indicating that physical interaction alone is not sufficient for disturbing wild-type function. We propose that dominant-negative mutants directly influence wild-type activity within hetero-oligomers or else compete with wild-type MxA for a cellular or viral target.",

Activation of both pathways was attenuated by pertussis toxin. Overexpression of GRK2 (but not GRK4) largely attenuated the stimulation of the MAPK pathway by l-AP4, whereas it slightly potentiated the inhibition of FSK-stimulated cAMP formation. Transfection with a kinase-dead mutant of GRK2 (GRK2-K220R) or with the C-terminal fragment of GRK2 also reduced the mGlu4-mediated stimulation of MAPK, suggesting that GRK2 binds to the Gbetagamma subunits to inhibit signal propagation toward the MAPK pathway. This was confirmed by the evidence that GRK2 coimmunoprecipitated with Gbetagamma subunits in an agonist-dependent manner. Finally, neither GRK2 nor its kinase-dead mutant had any effect on agonist-induced mGlu4 receptor internalization in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged receptors. Agonist-dependent internalization was instead abolished by a negative-dominant mutant of dynamin, which also reduced the stimulation of MAPK pathway by l-AP4.

We found that every substitution of the underlined bases reduces AraC binding tenfold or more: 5' TAGCATTTTTATCCATA 3'. Substitutions at other bases have little or no effect. In the absence of L-arabinose we observed a sixfold reduction of binding of AraC to araI1. We have designated the 5' AGC sequence the A-box and the 5'TCCATA sequence the B-box. We synthesised DNA targets containing either two A or two B-boxes with the natural araI1-I2 spacing. Wild-type AraC binds both targets in the presence of L-arabinose in a gel shift-experiment. In the absence of L-arabinose, AraC binds only to the double B-box. We then tested various AraC mutant proteins in the same way.

Two-hybrid analysis of truncation and mutant constructs of the unique N-terminal region of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D5 were used to define a domain conferring interaction with the signaling scaffold protein, RACK1. RESULTS: Truncation and mutagenesis approaches showed that the RACK1-interacting domain on PDE4D5 comprised a cluster of residues provided by Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 together with a series of hydrophobic amino acids, namely Leu-29, Val-30, Leu-33, Leu-37 and Leu-38 in a 'Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Leu' repeat. This was done by 2-hybrid analyses and then confirmed in biochemical pull down analyses using GST-RACK1 and mutant PDE4D5 forms expressed in COS cells. Mutation of Arg-34, to alanine, in PDE4D5 attenuated its interaction with RACK1 both in 2-hybrid screens and in pull down analyses. A 38-mer peptide, whose sequence reflected residues 12 through 49 of PDE4D5, bound to RACK1 with similar affinity to native PDE4D5 itself (Ka circa 6 nM). CONCLUSIONS: The RACK1 Interaction Domain on PDE4D5, that we here call RAID1, is proposed to form an amphipathic helical structure that we suggest may interact with the C-terminal beta-propeller blades of RACK1 in a manner akin to the interaction of the helical G-gamma signal transducing protein with the beta-propeller protein, G-beta.",

We have previously shown that Gal-3 can import into the nucleus through at least two pathways; via passive diffusion and/or active transport (Nakahara, S., Oka, N., Wang, Y., Hogan, V., Inohara, H, and Raz, A. (2006) Cancer Res. 66, 9995-10006). Here, we investigated the process mediated by the active nuclear transport of Gal-3 and have identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like motif in its protein sequence, (223)HRVKKL(228), that resembles p53 and c-Myc NLSs ((378)SRHKKL(383), (322)AKRVKL(327)), respectively. Moreover, trimers of enhanced green fluorescence protein (3xGFP) fused with this NLS-like sequence, which is too large to passively diffuse through the nuclear pores, accumulated in the cell nuclei. To gain insights into this newly identified nuclear import mechanism, the interaction between Gal-3 and importins (importins alpha and beta) that carry the NLS harboring nuclear proteins into the nucleus, was investigated. Pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that wild-type Gal-3, but not mutant Gal-3 (R224A), binds to importin-alpha. Down-regulation of importin-beta by RNA interference (RNAi) efficiently abrogates its nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that impaired nuclear translocation of mutant Gal-3 protein (R224A) results in accelerated degradation compared with the wild-type protein. Thus, these results suggest that Gal-3 is translocated to the nucleus, in part, via the importin-alpha/beta route and that Arg(224) amino acid residue of human Gal-3 is essential for its active nuclear translocation and its molecular stability.",

Cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent causes of death in DM patients. Electrophysiological studies in cardiac muscles from DM patients and from DMPK(-/-) mice suggested that DMPK is critical to the modulation of cardiac contractility and to the maintenance of proper cardiac conduction activity. However, there are no data regarding the molecular signaling pathways involved in DM heart failure. Here we show that DMPK expression in cardiac myocytes is highly enriched in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it colocalizes with the ryanodine receptor and phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DMPK and PLN can physically associate. Furthermore, purified wild-type DMPK, but not a kinase-deficient mutant (K110A DMPK), phosphorylates PLN in vitro. Subsequent studies using the DMPK(-/-) mice demonstrated that PLN is hypo-phosphorylated in SR vesicles from DMPK(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Ca(2+) uptake in SR is impaired in ventricular homogenates from DMPK(-/-) mice. Together, our data suggest the existence of a novel regulatory DMPK pathway for cardiac contractility and provide a molecular mechanism for DM heart pathology.",

Fifteen minutes of serum stimulation of vanadate-pretreated AND-34-1-transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts induces tyrosine phosphorylation of AND-34 as well as coprecipitating 95-, 125-, and 130-kDa proteins. One of these tyrosine phosphorylated proteins is identified as p130Cas (Crk-associated substrate), a signaling molecule previously known to bind to a GDP-exchange factor (C3G) and inducibly associate with the focal adhesion complex.

Adenovirus-expressed constitutively activated Ras (RasV12) enhanced survival and the phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B) and MAP kinase (MAPK), two targets of Ras activity. Functional inhibition of endogenous Ras by adenovirus-expressed dominant-inhibitory Ras (N17Ras) decreased nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent survival and both Akt and MAPK phosphorylation as well. To determine the signaling pathways through which Ras mediates survival, we used Ras effector mutants and pharmacological inhibitors that selectively suppress phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt or MAP kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPK pathways. The Ras effector mutant Ras(V12)Y40C, which selectively stimulates PI3-K and Akt, rescued survival in the absence of NGF, and the PI3-K inhibitor LY 294002 inhibited both Ras- and NGF-dependent survival. Ras(V12)T(35)S, which activates MEK/MAPK but not PI3-K/Akt, was less effective at rescuing survival, whereas the MEK inhibitor PD 098059 also partially suppressed Ras-dependent survival. To investigate the mechanisms by which Ras suppresses neuronal death, we examined whether Ras functions by inhibiting the proapoptotic p53 pathway (Jun-N-terminal kinase/p53/BAX) that is necessary for neuronal death after NGF withdrawal and p75NTR activation. We found that RasV12 suppressed c-jun, BAX, and p53 levels, whereas inhibition of NGF-induced Ras-survival activity via N17Ras increased the levels of these proteins. Furthermore, the E1B55K protein, which suppresses p53 activity, blocked N17Ras-induced neuronal death. Together, these results indicate that Ras is, in part, both necessary and sufficient for survival of sympathetic neurons and that this effect is mediated by activation of both the PI3-K- and MEK-signaling cascades, which in turn suppress a proapoptotic p53 pathway.",

Here, we present results describing the importance of dimerization in the Grb7-Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in terms of its structural integrity and the ability to bind phosphorylated tyrosine peptide ligands. A tyrosine phosphorylation-mimic mutant (Y80E-Grb7-SH2) is largely dimerization deficient and binds a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide representative of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) erbB2 with differing thermodynamic characteristics than the wild-type SH2 domain. Another dimerization-deficient mutant (F99R-Grb7-SH2) binds the phosphorylated erbB2 peptide with similarly changed thermodynamic characteristics. Both Y80E-Grb7-SH2 and F99R-Grb7-SH2 are structured by circular dichroism measurements but show reduced thermal stability relative to the wild type-Grb7-SH2 domain as measured by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance. It is well known that the dimerization state of RTKs (as binding partners to adaptor proteins such as Grb7) plays an important role in their regulation. Here, we propose the phosphorylation state of Grb7-SH2 domain tyrosine residues could control Grb7 dimerization, and dimerization may be an important regulatory step in Grb7 binding to RTKs such as erbB2. In this manner, additional dimerization-dependent regulation could occur downstream of the membrane-bound kinase in RTK-mediated signaling pathways.",

After platelet activation, pleckstrin is rapidly phosphorylated by protein kinase C. We reported previously that expressed phosphorylated pleckstrin induces cytoskeletal reorganization and localizes in microvilli along with glycoproteins, such as integrins. Given the role of integrins in cytoskeletal organization and cell spreading, we investigated whether signaling from pleckstrin cooperated with signaling pathways involving the platelet integrin, alphaIIbbeta3. Pleckstrin induced cell spreading in both transformed (COS-1 & CHO) and nontransformed (REF52) cell lines, and this spreading was regulated by pleckstrin phosphorylation. In REF52 cells, pleckstrin-induced spreading was matrix dependent, as evidenced by spreading of these cells on fibrinogen but not on fibronectin. Coexpression with alphaIIbbeta3 did not enhance pleckstrin-mediated cell spreading in either REF52 or CHO cells. However, coexpression of the inactive variant alphaIIbbeta3 Ser753Pro, or beta3 Ser753Pro alone, completely blocked pleckstrin-induced spreading. This implies that alphaIIbbeta3 Ser753Pro functions as a competitive inhibitor by blocking the effects of an endogenous receptor that is used in the signaling pathway involved in pleckstrin-induced cell spreading. Expression of a chimeric protein composed of the extracellular and transmembrane portion of Tac fused to the cytoplasmic tail of beta3 completely blocked pleckstrin-mediated spreading, whereas chimeras containing the cytoplasmic tail of beta3 Ser753Pro or alphaIIb had no effect. This suggests that the association of an unknown signaling protein with the cytoplasmic tail of an endogenous integrin beta-chain is also required for pleckstrin-induced spreading. Thus, expressed phosphorylated pleckstrin promotes cell spreading that is both matrix and integrin dependent. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a mutated integrin functioning as a dominant negative inhibitor.",

In this study, using immortalized chicken DT40 B cell lines to investigate the role of the Vav/Rac signalling cascade on B cell proliferation, it is shown that the proliferative response triggered by B cell receptor activation is dramatically reduced in the absence of Vav3 expression. Analysis of this proliferative defect shows that in the absence of Vav3 expression, retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation and the subsequent E2F activation do not take place. By combining pharmacological and genetic approaches, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and phospholipase C\u03b32 (PLC\u03b32) were identified as the key regulatory signalling molecules upstream of the Vav3/Rac pathway leading to RB phosphorylation and E2F transcription factor activation. Additionally, vav3(-/-) and plc\u03b32(-/-) DT40 B cells were not able to activate the RB-E2F complex wild-type phenotype when these genetically modified cells were transfected with constitutively active forms of RhoA or Cdc42. However, when these knockout cells were transfected with different constitutively active versions of PLC\u03b3, Vav or Rac1, not only activation of the RB-E2F complex wild-type phenotype was recovered but also the cellular proliferation. Furthermore, by evaluating the effect of two known effector mutants of Rac1 (Rac1(Q61L/F37A) and Rac1(Q61L/Y40C) ), the RB-E2F complex activation dependency on p21-activated kinase (PAK) and protein kinase C\u03b5 (PKC\u03b5) activities was established, being independent of both actin cytoskeleton reorganization and Ras activity.

The N1347S mutation prevented the death domain module binding stably to ERK in vitro and in vivo. Gel filtration demonstrated that the N1347S mutation disrupted the higher order oligomeric nature of the purified recombinant death domain miniprotein. Accordingly, the N1347S death domain module is defective in vivo in the formation of high molecular weight oligomeric intermediates after cross-linking with ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate). Full-length DAPK-1 protein harboring a N1347S mutation in the death domain was also defective in binding to ERK in cells and was defective in formation of an ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate)-cross-linked intermediate in vivo. Full-length DAPK-1 encoding the N1347S mutation was attenuated in tumor necrosis factor receptor-induced apoptosis.

The transcription factor C/EBPalpha maintains quiescence of hepatocytes through two pathways: inhibition of cdks and repression of E2F. Nevertheless, liver tumors and cultured hepatoma cell lines proliferate in the presence of C/EBPalpha. In this paper, we present evidence that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in liver tumor cells blocks the growth inhibitory activity of C/EBPalpha through the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of C/EBPalpha on Ser 193, leading to a failure of C/EBPalpha to interact with and inhibit cdks and E2F. Mutation of Ser 193 to Ala also abolishes the ability of C/EBPalpha to cause growth arrest because of a lack of interactions with cdk2 and E2F-Rb complexes. These data provide a molecular basis for the development of liver tumors in which the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway neutralizes C/EBPalpha growth inhibitory activity.",

HCV genome replication is also enhanced in proliferating cells. Thus, it is possible that HCV interactions with host cell cycle regulators, such as Rb, have evolved to modify the intracellular environment to promote viral replication. To test this hypothesis and to determine the impact of viral regulation of Rb on HCV replication, we constructed infectious viral genomes containing mutations in the Rb-binding motif of NS5B which ablate the ability of HCV to regulate Rb. These genomes underwent replication in transfected cells but produced variably reduced virus yields. One mutant, L314A, was severely compromised for replication and rapidly mutated to L314V, thereby restoring both Rb regulation and replication competence. Another mutant, C316A, also failed to downregulate Rb abundance and produced virus yields that were about one-third that of virus with the wild-type (wt) NS5B sequence. Despite this loss of replication competence, purified NS5B-C316A protein was two- to threefold more active than wt NS5B in cell-free polymerase and replicase assays. Although small interfering RNA knockdown of Rb did not rescue the replication fitness of these mutants, we conclude that the defect in replication fitness is not due to defective polymerase or replicase function and is more likely to result from the inability of the mutated NS5B to optimally regulate Rb abundance and thereby modulate host gene expression.",

Albumin endocytosis in the proximal tubule is regulated by protein complexes containing a number of transmembrane and accessory proteins including PDZ scaffolds such as NHERF1 and NHERF2. PDZ scaffold proteins bind to class I PDZ binding motifs (S/T-X-\u03a6) in the extreme C-terminus of targets. Megalin contains a functional PDZ binding motif (SDV) in its distal terminus, however a potential interaction with the NHERF proteins has not been investigated. As megalin associates with NHE3 in the microvilli and NHE3 is tethered to the intravillar cleft via its interaction with NHERF1, we investigated if there is a direct interaction between megalin and NHERF1 in renal proximal tubule cells. Using confocal microscopy we determined that megalin and NHERF1 co-localise in the apical region in proximal tubule cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed using rat kidney lysate indicated that megalin bound NHERF1 in vivo. Using fusion proteins and peptides, we determined that PDZ2 of NHERF1 bound to megalin and that this interaction was via the C-terminus of megalin directly and in the absence of any accessory protein. We next investigated which domain in megalin was regulating this interaction. Using GST fusion proteins we determined that the loss of the most distal C-terminus of megalin containing the PDZ binding motif (SDV) did not alter its ability to bind to NHERF1. Significantly, we then identified an internal NHERF binding domain in the C-terminus of megalin. Using peptide studies we were able to demonstrate that NHERF1 bound to an internal PDZ binding motif in megalin and that a loss of a single threonine residue abolished the interaction between megalin and NHERF1. Finally, in proximal tubule cells, silencing NHERF1 increased megalin expression. Therefore, we have identified a novel protein interaction in proximal tubule cells and specifically identified a new internal PDZ binding motif in the C-terminus of megalin.",

EphA2 mediates cell-cell communication and plays critical roles in a number of physiological and pathologic responses. We have previously shown that EphA2 is a key regulator of tumor angiogenesis and that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates EphA2 signaling. To understand the role of EphA2 phosphorylation, we have mapped phosphorylated tyrosines within the intracellular region of EphA2 by a combination of mass spectrometry analysis and phosphopeptide mapping using two-dimensional chromatography in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis. The function of these phosphorylated tyrosine residues was assessed by mutational analysis using EphA2-null endothelial cells reconstituted with EphA2 tyrosine-to-phenylalanine or tyrosine-to-glutamic acid substitution mutants. Phosphorylated Tyr(587) and Tyr(593) bind to Vav2 and Vav3 guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas Tyr(P)(734) binds to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Mutations that uncouple EphA2 with Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factors or p85 are defective in Rac1 activation and cell migration. Finally, EphA2 mutations in the juxtamembrane region (Y587F, Y593F, Y587E/Y593E), kinase domain (Y734F), or SAM domain (Y929F) inhibited ephrin-A1-induced vascular assembly. In addition, EphA2-null endothelial cells reconstituted with these mutants were unable to incorporate into tumor vasculature, suggesting a critical role of these phosphorylation tyrosine residues in transducing EphA2 signaling in vascular endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis.",

To determine whether the regulation of G protein pathways contributes to the mitogenic effects of rPMT, we have examined the mechanism whereby rPMT stimulates the Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in cultured HEK-293 cells. Treatment with rPMT resulted in a dose and time-dependent increase in Erk 1/2 phosphorylation that paralleled its stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Both rPMT- and alpha-thrombin receptor- stimulated Erk phosphorylation were selectively blocked by cellular expression of two peptide inhibitors of G(q/11) signaling, the dominant negative mutant G protein-coupled receptor kinase, GRK2(K220R), and the Galpha(q) carboxyl-terminal peptide, Galpha(q)-(305-359). Like alpha-thrombin receptor-mediated Erk activation, the effect of rPMT was insensitive to the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, but was blocked by the epidermal growth factor receptor-specific tyrphostin, AG1478 and by dominant negative mutants of mSos1 and Ha-Ras.

Tyrosine kinase mutant K290R is less cytotoxic. In contrast, a C-terminal deletion mutant that lacks the RNA polymerase 11 (PolII)/actin interaction domain, fails to mediate apoptosis unless expressed to very high levels. Cytotoxicity is overcome by coexpression of the apoptosis antagonist E1B 19K protein, and partially overcome by full-length retinoblastoma protein (Rb) or the C pocket fragment of Rb (SEA) that associates with c-Abl. c-Abl is also highly toxic to Saos-2 cells that are deficient for both Rb and p53, indicating that cell death is not the result of inhibition through c-Abl of the anti-apoptotic function of Rb. Finally, p53 and c-Abl combined induce apoptosis stronger than either protein alone. Unlike c-Abl-mediated cell death, apoptosis by p53 is antagonized efficiently only by full-length Rb with intact A/B pocket but not by SEA. Mutant p53 inhibits apoptosis by p53 but not c-Abl. Thus, c-Abl with intact kinase and PolII/ actin-binding domains can affect tumor cell survival independently of Rb and p53.",

Only high affinity CA binding requires the regulatory domain, believed to interact with the catalytic domain in the presence of CA. Without a crystal structure of the regulatory domain, the specific areas involved in this process are largely undefined. It is not clear whether the regulatory domain-catalytic domain interaction is asymmetrical across the tetramer to produce the high and low affinity sites. To investigate this, pure dimeric TH was generated through double substitution of residues at the tetramerization interface and dimerization salt bridge (K170E/L480A). This was shown to be the core regulatory unit of TH for CA inhibition, possessing both high and low affinity CA binding sites, indicating that there is symmetry between dimers of the tetramer. We also examined possible regulatory domain-interacting regions on the catalytic domain that mediate high affinity CA binding.

Here, we studied the role of these receptor complexes in mediating the oncogenic activity of JAK3 mutants. Although JAK3(V674A) and the majority of other JAK3 mutants needed to bind to a functional cytokine receptor complex to constitutively activate STAT5, JAK3(L857P) was unexpectedly found to not depend on such receptor complexes for its activity, which was induced without receptor or JAK1 co-expression. Introducing a mutation in the FERM domain that abolished JAK-receptor interaction did not affect JAK3(L857P) activity, whereas it inhibited the other receptor-dependent mutants. The same cytokine receptor independence as for JAK3(L857P) was observed for homologous Leu(857) mutations of JAK1 and JAK2 and for JAK3(L875H). This different cytokine receptor requirement correlated with different functional properties in vivo and with distinct sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Transduction of murine hematopoietic cells with JAK3(V674A) led homogenously to lymphoblastic leukemias in BALB/c mice. In contrast, transduction with JAK3(L857P) induced various types of lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. Moreover, ruxolitinib, which preferentially blocks JAK1 and JAK2, abolished the proliferation of cells transformed by the receptor-dependent JAK3(V674A), yet proved much less potent on cells expressing JAK3(L857P). These particular cells were, in contrast, more sensitive to JAK3-specific inhibitors.

A peptide corresponding to the putative CaM-binding domain of the Kir/Gem protein was synthesized, and its affinity for CaM was determined by fluorescence spectrometry. Titration of dansyl-CaM with the Kir/Gem peptide gave an affinity constant of 1 nM. Furthermore, a single point mutation of the peptide, W269G, abolished this high affinity interaction.

Our aim was to identify residues in Fas that are important for ligand binding.

The effects of these mutations on FasL binding was examined by measuring the ability of these proteins to inhibit FasL-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells and bind FasL in ELISA and BIAcore assays. Mutation of two amino acids, R86 and R87 (D2), to serine totally abolished the ability of Fas to interact with its ligand, whereas mutants K84S, L90S, E93S (D2), or H126S (D3) showed reduced binding compared with wild-type Fas. Two mutants (K78S and H95S) bound FasL comparably to wild type. Therefore, the binding of FasL involves residues in two domains that correspond to positions critical for ligand binding in other family members (TNFR and CD40) but are conserved between murine and human Fas.",

In cells arrested in G(1) and then synchronized to enter into S phase, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-157 p27 occurred in the cytosol during G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Both T157A and S10A p27 mutants localized in the nucleus in all phases of the cell cycle regardless of the expression of active Akt. Thr-157 phosphorylation was undetectable in S10A-p27, suggesting that Ser-10 phosphorylation is required for p27 localization in the cytosol and subsequent phosphorylation at Thr-157. Phosphorylation at Thr-157 interrupted the association of p27 with importin alpha. A T157A-p27 mutant protein exhibited higher association with importin alpha than wild-type-p27. Treatment of transfected and endogenous p27 with alkaline phosphatase rescued its association with importin alpha. Leptomycin B inhibited cytosolic Thr-157 P-p27 staining, implying that CRM1-dependent nuclear export is required for Akt-mediated Thr-157 phosphorylation. Heterokaryon shuttling assays with NIH3T3 (mouse) cells transfected with FLAG-p27 and HeLa (human) cells revealed that both wild type and T157A-p27 shuttled from NIH3T3 to HeLa cell nuclei with similar frequencies. However, S10A-p27 was found only in the NIH3T3 nuclei of NIH3T3-HeLa cell fusions. These results suggest that 1) Ser-10 phosphorylation is required for nuclear export of p27, 2) subsequent Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-157 during G(1) phase corrals p27 in the cytosol, and 3) Thr-157 phosphorylation inhibits the association of p27 with importin alpha thus preventing its re-entry into the nucleus.",

Further studies here demonstrate that scd5-Delta338 affects receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis and normal actin organization. The scd5-Delta338 mutant contains larger and depolarized cortical actin patches and a prevalence of G-actin bars. scd5-Delta338 also displays synthetic negative genetic interactions with mutations in several other proteins important for cortical actin organization and endocytosis. Moreover, Scd5p colocalizes with cortical actin. Analysis has revealed that clathrin-deficient yeast also have a major defect in cortical actin organization and accumulate G-actin. Overexpression of SCD5 partially suppresses the actin defect of clathrin mutants, whereas combining scd5-Delta338 with a clathrin mutation exacerbates the actin and endocytic phenotypes. Both Scd5p and yeast clathrin physically associate with Sla2p, a homologue of the mammalian huntingtin interacting protein HIP1 and the related HIP1R. Furthermore, Sla2p localization at the cell cortex is dependent on Scd5p and clathrin function. Therefore, Scd5p and clathrin are important for actin organization and endocytosis, and Sla2p may provide a critical link between clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton in yeast, similar to HIP1(R) in animal cells.",

In situ, the footprint over Delta3 is extended during G(1) phase, but only when Cdc18 is present and Mcm proteins are bound to chromatin. Moreover, this footprint extends into the adjacent Delta2 site, where leading strand DNA synthesis begins. Therefore, we conclude that ARS3001 consists of a single primary ORC binding site that assembles a pre-replication complex and initiates DNA synthesis, plus an additional novel origin element (Delta9) that neither binds ORC nor functions as a centromere, but does bind an as yet unidentified protein throughout the cell cycle.

To study the putative function of PELP1, we established stable MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines overexpressing PELP1. PELP1 overexpression hypersensitized breast cancer cells to E2 signaling, enhanced progression of breast cancer cells to S phase, and led to persistent hyperphosphorylation of pRb in an E2-dependent manner. Using phosphorylation site-specific pRb antibodies, we identified Ser-807/Ser-811 of pRb as a potential target site of PELP1. Interestingly, PELP1 was discovered to be physiologically associated with pRb and interacted via its C-terminal pocket domain, and PELP1/pRb interaction could be modulated by antiestrogen agents. Using mutant pRb cells, we demonstrated an essential role for PELP1/pRb interactions in the maximal coactivation functions of PELP1 using cyclin D1 as one of the targets. Taken together, these findings suggest that PELP1, a steroid coactivator, plays a permissive role in E2-mediated cell cycle progression, presumably via its regulatory interaction with the pRb pathway.",

Substitution of valine for aspartic acid 816 (D816V) constitutively actives human c-Kit, and this mutation is found in patients with mastocytosis, leukemia, and germ cell tumors. Immortalized murine progenitor cells (MIHCs) transduced with wild-type c-Kit proliferate in response to SCF, whereas cells expressing D816V c-Kit (MIHC-D816V) are factor-independent and tumorigenic. However, the mechanisms mediating transformation by D816V c-Kit are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify signaling components that contribute to D816V c-Kit-mediated transformation. SCF stimulates association of p85PI3K with phosphorylated tyrosine 721 of wild-type c-Kit. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) subsequently contributes to the activation of Akt and Jnks. In contrast, these studies demonstrated that the D816V c-Kit mutant was constitutively associated with phosphorylated p85PI3K, and, downstream of PI3K, Jnk 1 and Jnk 2 were activated but Akt was not. Interestingly, Erks 1 and 2 were not constitutively activated by D816V c-Kit. Thus, D816V c-Kit maintains the activity of PI3K but not of all signaling pathways activated by wild-type c-Kit. Further, all pathways downstream of PI3K are not constitutively active in MIHC-D816V cells. Studies with a PI3K inhibitor and D816V/Y721F c-Kit, a mutant incapable of recruiting PI3K, indicate that constitutive activation of PI3K through direct recruitment by D816V c-Kit plays a role in factor-independent growth of MIHC and is critical for tumorigenicity.",

One in two human tumors contains a point mutation in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 (residues 94-312). Most existing studies on the effects of these mutations on p53 structure and function have been carried out on the isolated DBD fragment, which is monomeric. Recent structural evidence, however, suggests that DBDs may interact with each other in full-length tetrameric forms of p53. Here, we investigate the effects of tumorigenic DBD mutations on the folding of p53 in its tetrameric form. We employ the construct consisting of DBD and TD (amino acids 94-360). We characterize the stability and conformational state of the tumorigenic DBD mutants R248Q, R249S, and R282Q using equilibrium denaturation and functional assays. Destabilizing mutations cause DBD to misfold when it is part of the p53 tetramer, but not when it is monomeric. This conformation is populated under moderately destabilizing conditions (10 degrees C in 2 M urea, and at physiological temperature in the absence of denaturant). Under those same conditions, it is not present in the isolated DBD fragment or in the presence of the TD mutation L344P, which abolishes tetramerization. Misfolding appears to involve intramolecular DBD-DBD association within a single tetrameric molecule. This association is promoted by destabilization of DBD (caused by mutation or elevated temperature) and by the high local DBD concentration enforced by tetramerization of TD. Disrupting the nonnative DBD-DBD interaction or transiently inhibiting tetramerization and allowing p53 to fold as a monomer may be potential strategies for pharmacological intervention in cancer.",

In the present study, we investigated whether the initial phosphorylation of these residues by p42(mapk/erk2) promotes hierarchical phosphorylation of additional sites within the cytoplasmic domain of TNF-R1. This question was addressed by investigating the ability of the TNF-R1.4D/E mutant receptor to be phosphorylated in in vitro kinase assays using GST-mutant cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins as substrates and in intact cells following mutant receptor expression. In addition, we determined the location of the additional phosphorylation sites. Incubation of Sepharose bead-bound GST-TNF-R1(207)(-)(425).4D/E fusion protein with lysates containing activated p42(mapk/erk2) led to the phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues in addition to the previously defined sites at T236, S240, S244, and S270. Deletional mutagenesis localized these residues to a stretch of 14 amino acids that encompasses three basic Pro-directed ([S/T]P) kinase consensus sequences located between residues S256 and T267. Point mutagenesis of T257, S262, and T267 to Ala residues indicated that these sites are targets of phosphorylation by p42(mapk/)(erk2).

Almost nothing is known about the molecular basis for the selectivity of GRP. To address this question, we first studied four loss-of-affinity GRPR chimeric receptors formed by exchanging the four extracellular (EC) domains of GRPR with the corresponding NMBR EC domains. Receptors were transiently expressed, and affinities were determined by binding studies. Only substitution of the third EC domain (EC3) of GRPR markedly decreased GRP affinity. In the reverse study using gain-of-affinity NMBR chimeras, only replacement of EC3 of NMBR markedly increased GRP affinity. Replacing each of the 20 comparable EC3 amino acids that differed in the NMBR in GRPR showed that two separate NMBR substitutions in the GRPR, Ile for Phe(185) or Ile for Ala(198), markedly decreased GRP affinity. Additional point mutants demonstrated that an amino acid with an aromatic ring in position 185 of GRPR and the size of the backbone substitution in position 198 of GRPR were important for GRP selectivity. These results demonstrate that selectivity of GRP for GRPR over NMBR is primarily determined by two amino acid differences in the EC3 domains of the receptor. Our results suggest that an interaction between the aromatic ring of Phe(185) of the GRPR with GRP is the most important for GRP selectivity.",

The SUMO-1 conjugation pathway is very similar to that of ubiquitin with regard to the primary sequences of the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), the three-dimensional structures of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and the chemistry of the overall conjugation pathway. The interaction of substrates with Ubc9 has been studied using NMR spectroscopy. Peptides with sequences that correspond to those of the SUMO-1 conjugation sites from p53 and c-Jun both bind to a surface adjacent to the active site Cys93 of human Ubc9, which has been previously shown to include residues that demonstrate the most significant dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Mutations in this region, Q126A, Q130A, A131D, E132A, Y134A, and T135A, were constructed to evaluate the role of these residues in SUMO-1 conjugation. These alterations have significant effects on the conjugation of SUMO-1 with the target proteins p53, E1B, and promyelocytic leukemia protein and define a substrate binding site on Ubc9. Furthermore, the SUMO-1 conjugation site of p53 does not form any defined secondary structure when either free or bound to Ubc9. This suggests that a defined secondary structure at SUMO-1 conjugation sites in target proteins is not necessary for recognition and conjugation by the SUMO-1 pathway.",

DP15, a peptide corresponding to RyR1 residues 4820-4841, produced significant activation of [3H]ryanodine binding above threshold Ca2+ concentrations (>or=0.3 microM), but MH mutations (L4823P or L4837V) made in DP15 almost completely abolished its channel activating function. To identify the DP15 binding site(s) within RyR1, DP15 (labeled with a fluorescent probe Alexa Fluor 680 and a photoaffinity cross-linker APG) was cross-linked to RyR1, and the site of cross-linking was identified by gel analysis of fluorescently labeled proteolytic fragments with the aid of Western blotting with site-specific antibodies. The shortest fluorescently labeled band was a 96 kDa fragment which was stained with an antibody directed to the region of residues 4114-4142 of RyR1, indicating that the interaction between the region of residues 4820-4841 adjacent to the channel pore and the 96 kDa segment containing the region of residues 4114-4142 is involved in the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent channel regulation. In further support of this concept, anti-DP15 antibody and cardiac counterpart of DP15 produced channel activation similar to that of DP15.",

These findings were corroborated by experiments investigating co-immunoprecipitation of the wild type (WT) and N376D mutant of the 5-HT2A receptor with ARF1 or 6 or dominant negative ARF1/6 constructs co-expressed in COS7 cells. In functional assays of 5-HT-induced phospholipase D (PLD) activation responses of the WT receptor were inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of ARF1 but not ARF6, whereas responses of the N376D mutant were strongly inhibited by negative mutant ARF6. No equivalent effect of the ARF mutants was seen on phospholipase C activation. In experiments assaying 5-HT-induced increases in [35S]GTPgammaS binding to ARF 1/6 immunoprecipitates as a measure of ARF activation, increased ARF6 activation was seen only with the mutant receptor. When cellular PLD responses of other NPxxY- or a DPxxY-containing GPCRs were measured in the presence of dominant negative ARF1/6 constructs, the majority, but not all, fitted the pattern exemplified by the 5-HT2A receptor and its N376D mutant.

Using bacterially expressed fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of the abl tyrosine kinase, we have quantitated the binding of these domains to the activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). A 35S-labeled abl SH2 fusion protein binds to the human EGFR immunoprecipitated from EGF-treated NIH3T3 cells that overexpress the receptor. This binding is totally dependent on the pretreatment of cells with EGF. The interaction is rapid, reaching 50% of maximum within 1 min, and attaining apparent equilibrium by 10 min. Dissociation of the complex is biphasic with a rapidly dissociating component (t1/2 of less than 1 min), as well as a slowly dissociable component. The 35S-labeled abl SH2 fusion protein specifically binds to the EGFR in a saturable manner and is differentially inhibited by unlabeled fusion proteins containing SH2 domains from phospholipase C, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and the GTPase activation protein of ras. To identify residues critical for abl SH2-EGFR binding, six point mutants were constructed in the highly conserved FLVRES motif. Three mutants (V170L, E172Q, and E174Q) display binding affinities similar to that of wild type. However, three other mutants (R171K, S173C, and S175C) have greatly reduced affinity. Interestingly, the binding affinity to the EGFR determined by the in vitro assay directly correlates with the transforming ability of the corresponding v-abl constructs in vivo (Mayer, B. J., Jackson, P. K., Etten, R. A. V., and Baltimore, D. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 609-618).

Recombinant calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB), an alphaIIb-specific ligand, bound to the alphaIIb cytoplasmic peptide in a Ca2+- or Mn2+-independent, one-to-one reaction with a KD value of 12 microM. In contrast, in vitro liquid phase binding of CIB to intact alphaIIbbeta3 occurred preferentially with Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3 conformers, as demonstrated by enhanced coimmunoprecipitation of CIB with PAC-1-captured Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3, suggesting that Mn2+ activation of intact alphaIIbbeta3 induces the exposure of a CIB-binding site, spontaneously exposed by the free alphaIIb peptide. Since CIB did not stimulate PAC-1 binding to inactive alphaIIbbeta3 nor prevented activated alphaIIbbeta3 occupancy by PAC-1, we conclude that CIB does not regulate alphaIIbbeta3 inside-out signaling, but rather is involved in an alphaIIbbeta3 post-receptor occupancy event.",

Nearly all these disease-associated N-terminal mutations are located at domain interfaces or buried within domains. Mutations at these locations would alter domain-domain interactions or the stability/folding of domains. Recently, a novel RyR2 mutation H29D associated with ventricular arrhythmia at rest was found to enhance the activation of single RyR2 channels by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca2+. Unlike other N-terminal disease-associated mutations, the H29D mutation is located on the surface of the N-terminal domain. It is unclear how this surface-exposed H29D mutation that does not appear to interact with other parts of the RyR2 structure could alter the intrinsic properties of the channel. Here we carried out detailed functional characterization of the RyR2-H29D mutant at the molecular and cellular levels. We found that the H29D mutation has no effect on the basal level or the Ca2+ dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2, the cytosolic Ca2+ activation of single RyR2 channels, or the cytosolic Ca2+- or caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells. In addition, the H29D mutation does not alter the propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release or the thresholds for Ca2+ release activation or termination. Furthermore, the H29D mutation does not have significant impact on the thermal stability of the N-terminal region (residues 1-547) of RyR2. Collectively, our data show that the H29D mutation exerts little or no effect on the function of RyR2 or on the folding stability of the N-terminal region. Thus, our results provide no evidence that the H29D mutation enhances the cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2.",

K-Ras Asp12 (K12D) is more prevalent in benign than in malignant human colorectal tumors, whereas K-Ras Val12 (K12V) associates with more advanced and metastatic carcinomas, higher recurrence and decreased survival. Here, we tested, in a nude mouse xenograft model, whether different human K-Ras oncogenes mutated at codon 12 to Val, Asp or Cys would confer NIH3T3 fibroblasts distinct oncogenic phenotypes. We studied tumor histology and growth, apoptotic and mitotic rates, activation of signal transduction pathways downstream of Ras and regulation of the cell cycle and apoptotic proteins in tumors derived from the implanted transformants. We found that the K12V oncogene induces a more aggressive tumorigenic phenotype than the K12D oncogene, whereas K12C does not induce tumors in this model. Thus, K12V mutant tumors proliferate about seven times faster, and have higher cellularity and mitotic rates than the K12D mutant tumors. A molecular analysis of the induced tumors shows that the K12V mutant protein interacts with Raf-1 and transduces signals mainly through the Erk pathway. Unexpectedly, in tumors induced by the K12D oncogene, the K-Ras mutant protein does not interact with Raf-1 nor activates the Erk canonical pathway. Instead, it transduces signals through the PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38 and FAK pathways. Finally, the higher growth rate of the K12V tumors associates with enhanced Rb phosphorylation, and PCNA and cyclin B upregulation, consistent with faster G1/S and G2/M transitions, without alteration of apoptotic regulation.",

Furthermore, transfected NICD molecules showed a significantly greater specific activity of phosphorylation, or hyperphosphorylation, compared to TMIC molecules. Hyperphosphorylation of NICD was also observed when NICD was generated by an endogenous intramembraneous cleavage of TMIC. However, TMIC molecules bearing a mutation that reduces intramembraneous cleavage (V1744K) did not show an enhanced incorporation of phosphate, suggesting that cleavage is required for hyperphosphorylation. Using deletion constructs to map the sites of phosphorylation, we observed that a domain of 93 amino acids downstream of the ankyrin repeats incorporated the majority of (32)P in vivo. This sequence was also required for activation of the HES-1 promoter. In addition, we observed that hyperphosphorylated forms of the intracellular domain were more likely to interact with the transcriptional coactivator RBP. However, dephosphorylation experiments showed that the interaction between RBP and the intracellular domain of Notch was not dependent upon Notch1IC phosphorylation. These studies reveal that phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor is a dynamic process during the events of Notch signal transduction.",

Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G, was required for this activation; C3G as well as the adaptor protein, CrkII, in cell extract bound to Triton cytoskeletons in a stretch-dependent manner. CrkII binding, which was Cas dependent, correlated with stretch-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in Triton cytoskeletons including Cas at the contacts with ECM.

The potato RB gene, derived from the wild species Solanum bulbocastanum, confers resistance to most P. infestans strains through recognition of members of the pathogen effector family IPI-O. While the majority of IPI-O proteins are recognized by RB to elicit resistance (e.g. IPI-O1, IPI-O2), some family members are able to elude detection (e.g. IPI-O4). In addition, IPI-O4 blocks recognition of IPI-O1, leading to inactivation of RB-mediated programmed cell death. Here, we report results that elucidate molecular mechanisms governing resistance elicitation or suppression of RB by IPI-O. Our data indicate self-association of the RB coiled coil (CC) domain as well as a physical interaction between this domain and the effectors IPI-O4 and IPI-O1. We identified four amino acids within IPI-O that are critical for interaction with the RB CC domain and one of these amino acids, at position 129, determines hypersensitive response (HR) elicitation in planta. IPI-O1 mutant L129P fails to induce HR in presence of RB while IPI-O4 P129L gains the ability to induce an HR. Like IPI-O4, IPI-O1 L129P is also able to suppress the HR mediated by RB, indicating a critical step in the evolution of this gene family.

TREK-1 is a two-pore domain background K+ channel (KCNK2, K2P2.1) that is sensitive to a variety of physicochemical and humoral factors. In this work, we used a recombinant expression system to show that activation of G alpha(q)-coupled receptors leads to inhibition of TREK-1 channels via protein kinase C (PKC), and we identified a critical phosphorylation site in a key regulatory domain that mediates inhibition of the channel. In HEK 293 cells co-expressing TREK-1 and either the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR1) or the Orexin receptor (Orx1R), agonist stimulation induced robust channel inhibition that was suppressed by a bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor but not by a protein kinase A blocker ((R(p))-cAMP-S). Channel inhibition by agonists or by direct activators of PKC (phorbol dibutyrate) and PKA (forskolin) was disrupted not only by alanine or aspartate mutations at an identified PKA site (Ser-333) in the C terminus, but also at a more proximal regulatory site in the cytoplasmic C terminus (Ser-300); S333A and S300A mutations enhanced basal TREK-1 current, whereas S333D and S300D substitutions mimicked phosphorylation and strongly diminished currents. When studied in combination, TREK-1 current density was enhanced in S300A/S333D but reduced in S300D/S333A mutant channels. Channel mutants were expressed and appropriately targeted to cell membranes. Together, these data support a sequential phosphorylation model in which receptor-induced kinase activation drives modification at Ser-333 that enables subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-300 to inhibit TREK-1 channel activity.",

Rather, mAb-1347 blocked the F-triggering function of H-proteins regardless of the presence or absence of the head domains. Remarkably, mAb-1347 binding to headless CDV H, as well as standard and engineered bioactive stalk-elongated CDV H-constructs treated with cells expressing the SLAM receptor, was enhanced. Despite proper cell surface expression, fusion promotion by most H-stalk mutants harboring alanine substitutions in the 126-138 \"spacer\" section was substantially impaired, consistent with deficient receptor-induced mAb-1347 binding enhancement. However, a previously reported F-triggering defective H-I98A variant still exhibited the receptor-induced \"head-stalk\" rearrangement. Collectively, our data spotlight a distinct mechanism for morbillivirus membrane fusion activation: prior to receptor contact, at least one of the morbillivirus H-head domains interacts with the membrane-distal \"spacer\" domain in the H-stalk, leaving the F-binding site located further membrane-proximal in the stalk fully accessible. This \"head-to-spacer\" interaction conformationally stabilizes H in an auto-repressed state, which enables intracellular H-stalk/F engagement while preventing the inherent H-stalk's bioactivity that may prematurely activate F. Receptor-contact disrupts the \"head-to-spacer\" interaction, which subsequently \"unlocks\" the stalk, allowing it to rearrange and trigger F. Overall, our study reveals essential mechanistic requirements governing the activation of the morbillivirus membrane fusion cascade and spotlights the H-stalk \"spacer\" microdomain as a possible drug target for antiviral therapy.",

The sites of alpha 1-beta subunit interaction have been localized recently to cytoplasmic domains of both subunits. The alpha 1 subunit interaction domain (AID) is an 18-amino-acid conserved motif located between repeats I and II on all alpha 1 subunits which is essential for the binding of beta subunits. In order to further study the interaction of beta subunits with AID, we have expressed a 50-amino-acid glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein from the alpha 1A subunit that contains the AID. Mutant GST fusion proteins that contain a single amino acid change (Y392S, Y392F, and Y392W) in the AIDA along with control GST were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to form affinity beads. Binding assays using these affinity beads with in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled beta 2 and beta 3 subunits demonstrate that the hydroxyl group on tyrosine 392 of AIDA is critical for binding to beta subunits. The affinity bead assay was also used to identify and characterize native beta subunits from detergent extracts of different tissues. The AIDA affinity beads, but not the control or Y392S beads, specifically bind beta subunits from detergent extracts of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain. Immunoblot analyses demonstrate the presence of beta 1a in skeletal muscle, beta 2 and beta 3 in cardiac muscle, and beta 1b, beta 3, and beta 4 in brain. The assays also demonstrate the AIDA beads bind to beta subunits from tissue homogenates extracted with low salt and no detergent suggesting the existence of a pool of beta subunits which is not always associated with alpha 1 subunits. Also, beta subunits from solubilized skeletal muscle triads can be affinity-purified using AIDA CNBr-Sepharose. Our data demonstrate that the AID binds to native beta subunits from detergent and non-detergent tissue extracts illustrating that this domain on the alpha 1 subunit is the major anchoring site for the beta subunit.",

In this report, we investigated whether the interaction of the CHK SH2 domain and ErbB-2 is directly related to the inhibition of heregulin-stimulated Src kinase activity. We constructed three CHK SH2 domain binding mutants: G129R (enhanced binding), R147K (inhibited binding), and R147A (disrupted binding). NMR spectra for the domains of each construct were used to evaluate their interaction with a Tyr(P)(1248)-containing ErbB-2 peptide. G129R showed enhanced binding to ErbB-2, whereas binding was completely disrupted by R147A. The enhanced binding mutant showed chemical shift changes at the same residues as wild-type CHK, indicating that this mutant has the same binding characteristics as the wild-type protein. Furthermore, inhibition of heregulin-stimulated Src kinase activity was markedly diminished by R147A, whereas G129R-mediated inhibition was stronger as compared with wild-type CHK. These results indicate that the specific interaction of CHK and ErbB-2 via the SH2 domain of CHK is directly related to the growth inhibitory effects of CHK. These new CHK high affinity binding constructs may serve as good candidates for inhibition of the ErbB-2/Src transduction pathway in gene therapy studies in breast cancer.",

We demonstrated that a significant amount of Nedd4-2 protein was distributed to the absorptive epithelial cells in ileum, cecum, and colon along with TRPV6. When co-expressed in oocytes, Nedd4-2 and, to a lesser extent, Nedd4 down-regulated the protein abundance and Ca(2+) influx of TRPV6 and TRPV5, respectively. TRPV6 ubiquitination was increased, and its stability was decreased by Nedd4-2. The Nedd4-2 inhibitory effects on TRPV6 were partially blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not by the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine. The rate of TRPV6 internalization was not significantly altered by Nedd4-2. The HECT domain was essential to the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on TRPV6 and to their association. The WW1 and WW2 domains interacted with TRPV6 terminal regions, and a disruption of the interactions by D204H and D376H mutations in the WW1 and WW2 domains increased TRPV6 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, WW1 and WW2 may serve as a molecular switch to limit the ubiquitination of TRPV6 by the HECT domain. In conclusion, Nedd4-2 may regulate TRPV6 protein abundance in intestinal epithelia by controlling TRPV6 ubiquitination.",

The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc42 occurs at tyrosine 64 in the Switch II domain and appears to be mediated through the Src tyrosine kinase, because both the expression of a dominant-negative Src mutant (mouse Src(K297R)) and treatment of cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocks the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42, whereas expression of an activated Src mutant (Src(Y529F)) promotes phosphorylation in the absence of EGF treatment. The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 is not required for its activation, nor does it directly affect the interactions of activated Cdc42 with target/effector proteins including PAK, ACK, WASP, or IQGAP. However, the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 is accompanied by an enhancement in the interaction of Cdc42 with the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). The EGF-stimulated activation of Cdc42 does require activated Src, as well as the Vav2 protein, a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Src catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2, and overexpression of Vav2 together with activated Src (Src(Y529F)) can completely bypass the need for EGF to promote the activation of Cdc42. Thus, EGF signaling through Src appears to have dual regulatory effects on Cdc42: 1). it leads to the activation of Cdc42 as mediated by the Vav2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and 2). it results in the phosphorylation of Cdc42, which stimulates the binding of RhoGDI, perhaps to direct the movement of Cdc42 to a specific cellular site to trigger a signaling response, because Cdc42-RhoGDI interactions are essential for Cdc42-induced cellular transformation.",

Here we report that Ser-132 in both E1A products is a site of phosphorylation in vivo and is the only site phosphorylated in vitro by purified casein kinase II. Ser-132 is located in conserved region 2 near the primary binding site for the pRB tumor suppressor and, in 289R, just upstream of the conserved region 3 transactivation domain involved in regulation of early viral gene expression. Mutants containing alanine or glycine in place of Ser-132 interacted with pRB-related proteins at somewhat reduced efficiency; however, all Ser-132 mutants transformed primary rat cells in cooperation with E1B as well as or better than the wild type when both major E1A proteins were expressed. Such was not the case with mutants expressing only 289R. In cooperation with E1B, the Asp-132 and Gly-132 mutants yielded reduced numbers of smaller transformed foci. With activated ras, all Ser-132 mutants were significantly defective for transformation and the rare foci produced were small and contained extensive areas populated by low densities of flat cells. In the absence of E1B, all Ser-132 mutants induced p53-independent cell death more readily than virus expressing wild-type 289R. These results suggested that phosphorylation at Ser-132 may enhance the binding of pRB and related proteins and also reduce the toxicity of E1A 289R, thus increasing transforming activity.",

The inhibition was specific for Dnmt1 and for the particular peptide sequence. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser515 is important for an interaction between the N-terminal domain of Dnmt1 and its catalytic domain that is necessary for activity and that this interaction is specifically disrupted by the phosphorylated peptide.

Here, we show that Rad51-K342E displays DNA-independent and DNA-dependent ATPase activities, owing to its ability to form filaments in the absence of a DNA lattice. These filaments exhibit a compressed pitch of 81 A, whereas filaments of wild-type Rad51 and Rad51-K342E on DNA form extended filaments with a 97 A pitch. Rad51-K342E shows near normal binding to ssDNA, but displays a defect in dsDNA binding, resulting in less stable protein-dsDNA complexes. The mutant protein is capable of catalyzing the DNA strand exchange reaction and is insensitive to inhibition by the early addition of dsDNA. Wild-type Rad51 protein is inhibited under such conditions, because of its ability to bind dsDNA. No significant changes in the interaction between Rad51-K342E and Rad54 could be identified.

The role of the de-ubiquitinating enzymes AMSH and UBPY in endosomal trafficking of cargo proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has only very recently been the subject of study and is already a matter of debate. Although one report (Mizuno, E., Iura, T., Mukai, A., Yoshimori, T., Kitamura, N., and Komada, M. (2005) Mol. Biol. Cell 16, 5163-5174) concludes that UBPY negatively regulates EGFR degradation by de-ubiquitinating the EGFR on endosomes, another report (Row, P. E., Prior, I. A., McCullough, J., Clague, M. J., and Urbe, S. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 12618-12624) concludes that UBPY-mediated EGFR de-ubiquitination is essential for EGFR degradation. Here, we demonstrate that Usp8/UBPY, the mammalian ortholog of budding yeast Ubp4/Doa4, constitutively co-precipitates in a bivalent manner with the EGFR. Moreover, UBPY is a substrate for Src-family tyrosine kinases that are activated after ligand-induced EGFR activation. Using overexpression of three different recombinant dominant negative UBPY mutants (UBPY C748A mutant, UBPY 1-505, and UBPY 640-1080) in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells, we demonstrate that UBPY affects both constitutive and ligand-induced (i) EGFR ubiquitination, (ii) EGFR expression levels, and (iii) the appearance of intermediate EGFR degradation products as well as (iv) downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction. Our findings provide further evidence in favor of the model that UBPY-mediated EGFR de-ubiquitination promotes EGFR degradation.",

AhR contains signals for both nuclear localization and nuclear export (NES). The objective of this study was to demonstrate how AhR intracellular distribution was regulated physiologically in cells. We found that cell density, but not the cell cycle, influenced the subcellular distribution of AhR in a keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT: AhR was predominantly nuclear at sparse cell densities, both nuclear and cytoplasmic at subconfluence, and predominantly cytoplasmic at confluence. Stable transfectants of HaCaT carrying a reporter gene fused with xenobiotic responsive element showed an association between xenobiotic responsive element-mediated transcription and AhR relocalization. Leptomycin B promoted nuclear accumulation of AhR irrespective of cell density, suggesting that this alteration may be because of a change of the regulation of the nuclear export of AhR. We found that Ser-68 in the NES of AhR was phosphorylated after nuclear accumulation of activated AhR and the nuclear export of a chimeric GST-AhR-GFP fusion protein was suppressed by substitution of a serine residue (Ser-68) to aspartic acid, which mimics the negative charge of phosphorylation. This novel cell density-dependent AhR relocalization was affected by exposure to SB203580, okadaic acid, and low Ca(2+) concentrations. These findings strongly suggest that cell density regulates the intracellular localization and function of AhR, because of modulation of nuclear export activity. The p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the NES and its dephosphorylation, regulated by cell-cell contact signals, may have pivotal roles in the novel AhR relocalization.",

          "text": "Recent literature implicates a regulatory function of the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) in receptor tyrosine kinases. Mutations in the JMD of c-Kit and Flt3 are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and acute myeloid leukemias, respectively. Additionally, autophosphorylated Tyr559 in the JMD of the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor (CSF-1R) binds to Src family kinases (SFKs). To investigate SFK function in CSF-1 signaling we established stable 32D myeloid cell lines expressing CSF-1Rs with mutated SFK binding sites (Tyr559-TFI). Whereas binding to I562S was not significantly perturbed, Y559F and Y559D exhibited markedly decreased CSF-1-dependent SFK association. All JMD mutants retained intrinsic kinase activity, but Y559F, and less so Y559D, showed dramatically reduced CSF-1-induced autophosphorylation. CSF-1-mediated wild-type (WT)-CSF-1R phosphorylation was not markedly affected by SFK inhibition, indicating that lack of SFK binding is not responsible for diminished Y559F phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, cells expressing Y559F were hyperproliferative in response to CSF-1. Hyperproliferation correlated with prolonged activation of Akt, ERK, and Stat5 in the Y559F mutant. Consistent with a defect in receptor negative regulation, c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and CSF-1R/c-Cbl co-association were almost undetectable in the Y559F mutant. Furthermore, Y559F underwent reduced multiubiquitination and delayed receptor internalization and degradation. In conclusion, we propose that Tyr559 is a switch residue that functions in kinase regulation, signal transduction and, indirectly, receptor down-regulation. These findings may have implications for the oncogenic conversion of c-Kit and Flt3 with JMD mutations.",

          "text": "Grb10 is a member of the Grb7 family of adapter proteins lacking intrinsic enzymatic function and encodes functional domains including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and an SH2 domain. The role of different Grb10 splice variants in signal transduction of growth factors like insulin or insulin-like growth factor has been described as inhibitory or stimulatory depending on the presence of a functional PH and/or SH2 domain. Performing a yeast two-hybrid screen with the c-kit cytoplasmic tail fused to LexA as a bait and a mouse embryo cDNA library as prey, we found that the Grb10 SH2 domain interacted with the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase. In the course of SCF-mediated activation of c-kit, Grb10 is recruited to the c-kit receptor in an SH2 domain- and phosphotyrosine-dependent but PH domain-independent manner. We found that Akt and Grb10 form a constitutive complex, suggesting a role for Grb10 in the translocation of Akt to the cell membrane. Indeed, coexpression studies revealed that Grb10 and c-kit activate Akt in a synergistic manner. This dose-dependent effect of Grb10 is wortmannin sensitive and was also seen at a lower level in cells in which c-kit was not expressed. Expression of a Grb10 mutant lacking the SH2 domain as well as a mutant lacking the PH domain did not influence Akt activity. Grb10-induced Akt activation was observed without increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity, suggesting that Grb10 is a positive regulator of Akt downstream of PI3-kinase. Significantly, deficient activation of Akt by a constitutively activated c-kit mutant lacking the binding site for PI3-kinase (c-kitD814V/Y719F) could be fully compensated by overexpression of Grb10. In Ba/F3 cells, the incapacity of c-kitD814V/Y719F to induce interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent growth could be rescued by overexpression of Grb10. In contrast, expression of the SH2 deletion mutant of Grb10 together with c-kitD814V/Y719F did not render Ba/F3 cells independent of IL-3. In summary, we provide evidence that Grb10 is part of the c-kit signaling pathway and that the expression level of Grb10 critically influences Akt activity. We propose a model in which Grb10 acts as a coactivator for Akt by virtue of its ability to form a complex with Akt and its SH2 domain-dependent translocation to the cell membrane.",

Although Fli1 down-regulation is implicated in pathological matrix remodeling such as cutaneous fibrosis in scleroderma, very little is known about the post-translational mechanisms regulating Fli1 function. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of acetylation, one of the main post-translational regulatory mechanisms, in regulating Fli1 activity. We initially demonstrated that Fli1 is acetylated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in dermal fibroblasts. An in vivo acetylation assay using 293T cells revealed that Fli1 is mainly acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) at lysine 380. Acetylation of Fli1 resulted in a decreased stability of Fli1 protein. More importantly, reduced binding of acetylated Fli1 to the human alpha2(I) collagen (COL1A2) promoter was observed in DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Conversely, a Fli1 K380R mutant that is resistant to acetylation by PCAF showed increased DNA binding ability. Furthermore, PCAF overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of Fli1 on TGF-beta1-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity. In contrast, the Fli1 K380R mutant had a greater inhibitory effect on TGF-beta1-induced COL1A2 promoter activity than wild-type Fli1, and PCAF failed to reverse this effect. These results indicate that PCAF-dependent acetylation of lysine 380 abrogates repressor function of Fli1 with respect to collagen gene expression. Furthermore, these data strongly suggest that the TGF-beta-dependent acetylation of Fli1 may represent the principal mechanism responsible for the TGF-beta-induced dissociation of Fli1 from the collagen promoter.",

Although both receptor subtypes are co-expressed in numerous cells, little is known about their ability to form heterodimers. Here we show that both receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with an ET(B)-specific antibody using extracts from HEK293 cells stably co-expressing a fusion protein consisting of a myc-tagged ET(A) receptor and CFP (ET(A)myc.CFP) and a fusion protein consisting of an ET(B) receptor and YFP (ET(B).YFP). Co-immunoprecipitation was also observed with extracts from HEK293 cells transiently co-expressing FLAG-tagged ET(B) and myc-tagged ET(A) receptors, thereby excluding that heterodimerization is mediated by the CFP/YFP moieties. Heterodimerization was further confirmed in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of HEK293 cells transiently co-expressing ET(A)myc.CFP and ET(B).YFP receptors. FRET efficiencies were between 12 and 18% in untreated and antagonist- or ET-1-treated cells, indicating constitutive heterodimerization. Prolonged stimulation (30 min) with the ET(B) receptor-selective agonist BQ3020 decreased FRET efficiency by 50%. This decrease was not observed when internalization was inhibited by co-expression of dominant-negative K44A.dynamin I or incubation with 450 mm sucrose. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and laser scanning microscopy of cell clones stably co-expressing ET(A)myc.CFP/ET(B)flag.YFP receptors revealed a slower sequestration of the ET(B)flag.YFP receptors upon stimulation with ET-1 than with BQ3020. No difference in ET-1 or BQ3020-mediated sequestration was observed with cell clones expressing ET(B)flag.YFP receptors alone. The data suggest that ET(A) and ET(B) receptors form constitutive heterodimers, which show a slower sequestration upon stimulation with ET-1 than with BQ3020.

The lack of structural information for CIP2A significantly prevents the design of anti-cancer therapeutics targeting this protein. In an attempt to counteract this fact, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain (CIP2A-ArmRP), analyzed key areas and amino acids, and coupled the results to the existing literature. The model reliably shows a stable armadillo repeat fold with a positively charged groove. The fact that this conserved groove highly likely binds peptides is corroborated by the presence of a conserved polar ladder, which is essential for the proper peptide-binding mode of armadillo repeat proteins and, according to our results, several known CIP2A interaction partners appropriately possess an ArmRP-binding consensus motif. Moreover, we show that Arg229Gln, which has been linked to the development of cancer, causes a significant change in charge and surface properties of CIP2A-ArmRP. In conclusion, our results reveal that CIP2A-ArmRP shares the typical fold, protein-protein interaction site and interaction patterns with other natural armadillo proteins and that, presumably, several interaction partners bind into the central groove of the modeled CIP2A-ArmRP. By providing essential structural characteristics of CIP2A, the present study significantly increases our knowledge on how CIP2A interacts with other proteins in cancer progression and how to develop new therapeutics targeting CIP2A.",

Gain-of-function mutations in codon 816 of the catalytic domain of human Kit [codon 814 of murine Kit (mKit)] are found in patients with mastocytosis, leukemia, and germ cell tumors. There are no drugs that inhibit the activity of Kit catalytic domain mutants to a greater extent than wild-type Kit. The objective of this study was to understand the biochemical mechanisms mediating mast cell transformation by this Kit mutant to identify molecular targets for pharmacological intervention. To this end, we examined signaling pathways activated in the murine mast cell line IC2 infected with either wild-type (IC2-mKit) or mutant mKit (IC2-mKit(D814Y)). In this study, we show that mKit(D814Y) is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine 719, and this likely results in constitutive association with activated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K). In vitro growth of IC2-mKit(D814Y) cells is more sensitive to inhibition of PI3K than SCF-induced growth of IC2-mKit cells. s.c. injection of IC2-mKit(D814Y) in syngeneic mice results in mast cell tumors. To determine whether inhibition of PI3K could reduce mKit(D814Y)-mediated tumorigenicity, mice were treated with 1.5 mg/kg wortmannin three times a week. Five weeks after injection of tumor cells, a 75% reduction in tumor weight was observed when wortmannin treatments were initiated 2 days after inoculation with tumor cells. A 66% reduction occurred when treatment was initiated 2 weeks after inoculation. Treatment with wortmannin increased necrosis in the tumors, and this was associated with apoptosis. Interestingly, there was no effect on tumor vasculature. Thus, PI3K is required for survival and growth of the IC2-mKit(D814Y) mast cell line both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may provide insight into designing strategies for treatment of mastocytosis and other diseases associated with mutations in the Kit catalytic domain.",

We have discovered that DNA damage-induced p53-Bcl2 binding is associated with decreased Bcl2-Bax interaction and increased apoptotic cell death in a mechanism regulated by Bcl2's flexible loop regulatory domain (FLD), since purified p53 protein can disrupt the Bcl2/Bax complex by directly binding to a negative regulatory region of the FLD (amino acids [aa] 32 to 68). Deletion of the negative regulatory region (Delta32-68) abolishes Bcl2-p53 binding and enhances Bcl2's antiapoptotic function. Conversely, removal of a positive regulatory region (aa 69 to 87) of the FLD, which contains the Bcl2 phosphorylation site(s) T69, S70, and S87, enhances Bcl2-p53 binding and significantly abrogates Bcl2's survival activity. The phospho-mimetic T69E/S70E/S87E (EEE) but not the nonphosphorylatable T69A/S70A/S87A (AAA) Bcl2 mutant displays a reduced capacity to bind p53 and potently inhibits p53-induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Furthermore, the FLD-only aa32-87 and aa32-68 peptides but not the aa69-87 peptide can directly bind p53 in vitro. p53-induced cytochrome c release occurs through a mechanism involving Bax's integral insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Either DNA damage to cells or expression of p53 selectively targeted to the mitochondria results in Bcl2-p53 binding followed by exposure of Bcl2's BH3 domain in association with inactivation of Bcl2's antiapoptotic function, indicating a conformational change in Bcl2 can occur upon direct ligation of p53. Thus, Bcl2's FLD contains both positive and negative regulatory regions which functionally regulate Bcl2's antiapoptotic activity by affecting Bax or p53 binding.",

This interaction prolongs the half-life of APP and inhibits Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion. X11alpha/Mint-1 has multiple protein-protein interaction domains, a Munc-18 interaction domain (MID), a Cask/Lin-2 interaction domain (CID), a PTB/PI domain, and two PDZ domains.

An HPV-16 E6 mutant (L50G) that binds CBP/p300, but not E6AP, is still capable of down-regulating p53 transcriptional activity. Thus, HPV E6 proteins possess two distinct mechanisms by which to abrogate p53 function: the repression of p53 transcriptional activity by targeting the p53 coactivator CBP/p300, and the removal of cellular p53 protein through the proteosome degradation pathway.",

When transiently transfected and overexpressed in either COS 7 cells or NIH3T3 cells, wild type DLK potently activated p46(SAPK) (SAPK/JNK) but had no detectable effect in activating p42/44(MAPK). DLK also activated p38(mapk) when overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. A catalytically inactive point mutant of DLK had no effect in these experiments. Consistent with its specificity in activating SAPK, DLK activated Elk-1 but not Sap1a-mediated transcription. In NIH3T3 cells, activation of SAPK by v-Src was markedly attenuated by coexpression of K185A, a catalytically inactive mutant of DLK, suggesting that this mutant could function in a dominant negative fashion in a pathway that leads from v-Src to SAPKs. In a series of co-transfection experiments, activation of p46(SAPK) by DLK was not inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, PAK65-R, or PAK65-A, but was attenuated by MEKK1(K432M). DLK(K185A) did not inhibit the ability of constitutively active MEKK1 to activate SAPK. Moreover, K185A significantly inhibited the activation of SAPK by constitutively active V-12 Rac1 and V-12 Cdc42Hs. These results suggest that DLK lies distal to Rac1 and/or Cdc42Hs but proximal to MEKK1 in a pathway leading from v-Src to SAPKs activation.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying activation of ACK remains largely unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that interaction of the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain with the EBD [EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-binding domain] in ACK1 forms an auto-inhibition of the kinase activity. Release of this auto-inhibition is a key step for activation of ACK1. Mutation of the SH3 domain caused activation of ACK1, independent of cell adhesion, suggesting that cell adhesion-mediated activation of ACK1 is through releasing the auto-inhibition. A region at the N-terminus of ACK1 (Leu10-Leu14) is essential for cell adhesion-mediated activation. In the activation of ACK1 by EGFR signalling, Grb2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2) mediates the interaction of ACK1 with EGFR through binding to the EBD and activates ACK1 by releasing the auto-inhibition. Furthermore, we found that mutation of Ser445 to proline caused constitutive activation of ACK1.

A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a new candidate Nav1.5-interacting protein, \u03b1B-crystallin. GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining analyses validated the interaction between Nav1.5 and \u03b1B-crystallin. Whole-cell patch clamping showed that overexpression of \u03b1B-crystallin significantly increased peak sodium current (INa) density, and the underlying molecular mechanism is the increased cell surface expression level of Nav1.5 via reduced internalization of cell surface Nav1.5 and ubiquitination of Nav1.5. Knock-out of \u03b1B-crystallin expression significantly decreased the cell surface expression level of Nav1.5. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that \u03b1B-crystallin interacted with Nedd4-2; however, a catalytically inactive Nedd4-2-C801S mutant impaired the interaction and abolished the up-regulation of INa by \u03b1B-crystallin.

Full-length PknD was cloned and expressed as a histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli. Differential centrifugation followed by sodium carbonate treatment of E. coli membranes demonstrated that His-PknD is an integral membrane protein. Fusions of overlapping PknD fragments to alkaline phosphatase revealed that PknD contains a single transmembrane domain and that the kinase domain is in the cytoplasm. To facilitate solubility, the kinase domain was cloned and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. coli. Purified GST-PknD kinase domain autophosphorylated, and catalytic mutants (K33G, D156G, and K33G-D156G mutants) and activation loop mutants (T185A and T193A) were inactive.

Parkin, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of substrate proteins that are important in the survival of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Accordingly, the abnormal accumulation of neurotoxic parkin substrates attributable to loss of parkin function may be the cause of neurodegeneration in parkin-related parkinsonism. We evaluated the known parkin substrates identified to date in parkin null mice to determine whether the absence of parkin results in accumulation of these substrates. Here we show that only the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase cofactor p38 is upregulated in the ventral midbrain/hindbrain of both young and old parkin null mice. Consistent with upregulation in parkin knock-out mice, brains of AR-JP and idiopathic PD and diffuse Lewy body disease also exhibit increased level of p38. In addition, p38 interacts with parkin and parkin ubiquitinates and targets p38 for degradation. Furthermore, overexpression of p38 induces cell death that increases with tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment and parkin blocks the pro-cell death effect of p38, whereas the R42P, familial-linked mutant of parkin, fails to rescue cell death. We further show that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p38 in the substantia nigra in mice leads to loss of dopaminergic neurons. Together, our study represents a major advance in our understanding of parkin function, because it clearly identifies p38 as an important authentic pathophysiologic substrate of parkin. Moreover, these results have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD.",

Trafficking of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 is dysregulated in neuropathic pain. We identify a trafficking program for NaV1.7 driven by hierarchical interactions with posttranslationally modified versions of the binding partner collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). The binding described between CRMP2 and NaV1.7 was enhanced by conjugation of CRMP2 with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) and further controlled by the phosphorylation status of CRMP2. We determined that CRMP2 SUMOylation is enhanced by prior phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and antagonized by Fyn phosphorylation. As a consequence of CRMP2 loss of SUMOylation and binding to NaV1.7, the channel displays decreased membrane localization and current density, and reduces neuronal excitability. Preventing CRMP2 SUMOylation with a SUMO-impaired CRMP2-K374A mutant triggered NaV1.7 internalization in a clathrin-dependent manner involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4) and endocytosis adaptor proteins Numb and epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15.

However, the mechanism by which G protein-coupled receptors activate p70(S6K) remains largely uncertain. By using vascular smooth muscle cells in which we have demonstrated Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation through Ca(2+)-dependent, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation by G(q)-coupled angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor, we present a unique cross-talk required for Ser(411) phosphorylation of p70(S6K) by Ang II. Both p70(S6K) Ser(411) and Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation by Ang II appear to involve EGF receptor transactivation and were inhibited by dominant-negative Ras, whereas the phosphorylation of p70(S6K) and ERK but not Akt was sensitive to the MEK inhibitor. By contrast, the phosphorylation of p70(S6K) and Akt but not ERK was sensitive to PI3K inhibitors. Similar inhibitory pattern on these phosphorylation sites by EGF but not insulin was observed. Taken together with the inhibition of Ang II-induced p70(S6K) activation by dominant-negative Ras and the MEK inhibitor, we conclude that Ang II-initiated activation of p70(S6K) requires both ERK cascade and PI3K/Akt cascade that bifurcate at the point of EGF receptor-dependent Ras activation.",

Upon glutamate binding, these receptors undergo a series of conformational rearrangements regulating channel function. Allosteric modulators can bind within a pocket adjacent to the ligand-binding domain to stabilize specific conformations and prevent desensitization. Yelshansky et al. (Yelshansky, M. V., Sobolevsky, A. I., Jatzke, C., and Wollmuth, L. P. (2004) J. Neurosci. 24, 4728-4736) described a model of an electrostatic interaction between the ligand-binding domain and linker region to the pore that regulated channel desensitization. To test this hypothesis, we have conducted a series of experiments focusing on the R628E mutation. Using ultrafast perfusion with voltage clamp, we applied glutamate to outside-out patches pulled from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing wild type or R628E mutant GluA2. In response to a brief pulse of glutamate (1 ms), mutant receptors deactivated with significantly slower kinetics than wild type receptors. In addition, R628E receptors showed significantly more steady-state current in response to a prolonged (500-ms) glutamate application. These changes in receptor kinetics occur through a pathway that is independent of that of allosteric modulators, which show an additive effect on R628E receptors. In addition, ligand binding assays revealed the R628E mutation to have increased affinity for agonist. Finally, we reconciled experimental data with computer simulations that explicitly model mutant and modulator interactions. Our data suggest that R628E stabilizes the receptor closed cleft conformation by reducing agonist dissociation and the transition to the desensitized state. These results suggest that the AMPA receptor external vestibule is a viable target for new positive allosteric modulators.",

In order to understand the role of p63 in cancer and development, genes that are specifically regulated by p63 but not p53 were identified. In this study, we provide evidence that p63gamma specifically upregulates vitamin D Receptor (VDR). In contrast, p53 does not appear to be involved in upregulation of VDR expression. Additionally, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring p63 missense mutant, p63gamma (R279H) and p14(ARF), both act in a dominant negative manner to inhibit p63gamma-mediated upregulation of VDR. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that p63 directly binds to the VDR promoter in vivo.

Using GP293 cells transfected with NPM-ALK, we confirmed that the MSH2(Y238F) mutant is not tyrosine phosphorylated. Furthermore, transfection of MSH2(Y238F) into these cells substantially decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous MSH2. Importantly, gene transfection of MSH2(Y238F) abrogated the binding of NPM-ALK with endogenous MSH2, re-established the dimerization of MSH2:MSH6 and restored the sensitivity to DNA mismatch-inducing drugs, indicative of MMR return. Parallel findings were observed in two ALK+ALCL cell lines, Karpas 299 and SUP-M2. In addition, we found that enforced expression of MSH2(Y238F) into ALK+ALCL cells alone was sufficient to induce spontaneous apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings have identified NPM-ALK-induced phosphorylation of MSH2 at Y238 as a crucial event in suppressing MMR. Our studies have provided novel insights into the mechanism by which oncogenic tyrosine kinases disrupt MMR.",

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1, C3G, binds constitutively to Crkl. Here, we report that Crkl mediates the formation of protein complexes that include C3G and Bcr/Abl. These complexes contain highly elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated C3G and P130Cas, a scaffolding protein. Moreover, the presence of Rap1 further promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and Cas. Co-expression of Crkl and C3G with Bcr/Abl generated increased levels of activated Rap1. In addition, lysates from leukemic cells of P190 BCR/ABL transgenic mice and of the myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 contained tyrosine-phosphorylated C3G and activated Rap1.

We observed that SHP-1 effectively antagonized Src-dependent phosphorylations in HEK293 cells. This occurred by dephosphorylation of Src substrates, because Src activity was unaffected in the presence of SHP-1. One reason for efficient dephosphorylation was activation of SHP-1 by Src. Recombinant SHP-1 had elevated activity subsequent to phosphorylation by Src in vitro, and SHP-1 variants with mutated phosphorylation sites in the C terminus, SHP-1 Y538F, and SHP-1 Y538F,Y566F were less active toward Src-generated phosphoproteins in intact cells. A second reason for efficient dephosphorylation is the substrate selectivity of SHP-1. Pull-down experiments with different GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins revealed efficient interaction of Src-generated phosphoproteins with the SHP-1 catalytic domain rather than with the SH2 domains. Phosphopeptides that correspond to good Src substrates were efficiently dephosphorylated by SHP-1 in vitro. Phosphorylated \"optimal Src substrate\" AEEEIpYGEFEA (where pY is phosphotyrosine) and a phosphopeptide corresponding to a recently identified Src phosphorylation site in p120 catenin, DDLDpY(296)GMMSD, were excellent SHP-1 substrates. Docking of these phosphopeptides into the catalytic domain of SHP-1 by molecular modeling was consistent with the biochemical data and explains the efficient interaction. Acidic residues N-terminal of the phosphotyrosine seem to be of major importance for efficient substrate interaction. Residues C-terminal of the phosphotyrosine probably contribute to the substrate selectivity of SHP-1. We propose that activation of SHP-1 by Src and complementary substrate specificities of SHP-1 and Src may lead to very transient Src signals in the presence of SHP-1.",

Cyclic nucleotide-induced relaxation of force in telokin-null ileum muscle was reduced but not correlated with a change in MYPT1 phosphorylation. The 40% inhibited activity of phosphorylated MYPT1 in telokin-null ileum homogenates was restored to nonphosphorylated MYPT1 levels by addition of S13D telokin. Using the GST-MYPT1 fragment as a ligand and SM homogenates from WT and telokin KO mice as a source of endogenous proteins, we found that only in the presence of endogenous telokin, thiophospho-GST-MYPT1 co-precipitated with phospho-20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain 20 and PP1. Surface plasmon resonance studies showed that S13D telokin bound to full-length phospho-MYPT1. Results of a protein ligation assay also supported interaction of endogenous phosphorylated MYPT1 with telokin in SM cells. We conclude that the mechanism of action of phospho-telokin is not through modulation of the MYPT1 phosphorylation status but rather it contributes to cyclic nucleotide-induced relaxation of SM by interacting with and activating the inhibited full-length phospho-MYPT1/PP1 through facilitating its binding to phosphomyosin and thus accelerating 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain dephosphorylation.",

PS stimulated phosphorylation of Bad and Mdm2, two downstream targets of Akt, which in neurons subjected to pathological overstimulation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) increased the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) levels and reduced the proapoptotic p53 and Bax levels. Adenoviral transduction with a kinase-deficient Akt mutant (Ad.Akt(K179A)) resulted in loss of PS-mediated neuronal protection, Akt activation, and Bad and Mdm2 phosphorylation. Using the TAM receptors tyrosine kinases Tyro3-, Axl-, and Mer-deficient neurons, we showed that PS protected neurons lacking Axl and Mer, but not Tyro3, suggesting a requirement of Tyro3 for PS-mediated protection. Consistent with these results, PS dose-dependently phosphorylated Tyro3 on neurons (EC(50) = 25 \u00b1 3 nm). In an in vivo model of NMDA-induced excitotoxic lesions in the striatum, PS dose-dependently reduced the lesion volume in control mice (EC(50) = 22 \u00b1 2 nm) and protected Axl(-/-) and Mer(-/-) transgenic mice, but not Tyro3(-/-) transgenic mice. Using different structural PS analogs, we demonstrated that the C terminus sex hormone-binding globulin-like (SHBG) domain of PS is critical for neuronal protection in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our data show that PS protects neurons by activating the Tyro3-PI3K-Akt pathway via its SHGB domain, suggesting potentially a novel neuroprotective approach for acute brain injury and chronic neurodegenerative disorders associated with excessive activation of NMDARs.",

Substitution of two valine residues corresponding to amino acids 95 and 96 (V95A and V96A) of the p16 peptide reduces the binding to cdk4 and cdk6 and increases its IC0.5 for kinase inhibition approximately threefold when linked to the Antennapedia homeodomain carrier sequence. The same mutations increase the IC0.5 approximately fivefold in the p16 protein. Substitution of aspartic acid 92 by alanine instead increases the binding of the peptide to cdk4 and cdk6 and the kinase inhibitory activity. The p16 peptide blocks S-phase entry in non-synchronized human HaCaT cells by approximately 90% at a 24 microM concentration. The V95A and V96A double substitution minimizes the cell cycle inhibitory capacity of the peptide whereas the D92A substitution increases its capacity to block cell cycle progression. A deletion series of the p16 derived peptide shows that a 10 residue peptide still retains cdk4-cyclin D1 kinase and cell cycle inhibitory activity. The p16 peptide inhibited S-phase entry in five cell lines tested, varying between 47-75%, but had only a limited (11%) inhibitory effect in the pRb negative Saos-2 cells at a concentration of 24 microM. Like the full length p16 protein, the p16 peptide does not inhibit cyclin E dependent cdk2 kinase activity in vitro.

At least part of the transforming ability of the MDM2 protein is due to binding and inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Additionally, this protein forms a complex in vivo with the L5 ribosomal protein and its associated 5S ribosomal RNA and may be part of a ribosomal complex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RNA homopolymer binding assay and a SELEX procedure have been used to characterize the RNA-binding activity of MDM2. RESULTS: The MDM2 protein binds efficiently to the homopolyribonucleotide poly(G) but not to other homopolyribonucleotides. This binding is independent of the interaction of MDM2 with the L5 protein, which occurs through the central acidic domain of MDM2. An RNA SELEX procedure was performed to identify specific RNA ligands that bind with high affinity to the human MDM2 (HDM2) protein. After 10 rounds of selection and amplification, a subset of RNA molecules that bound efficiently to HDM2 was isolated from a randomized pool. Sequencing of these selected ligands revealed that a small number of sequence motifs were selected. The specific RNA binding occurs through the RING finger domain of the protein. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution in the RING finger domain, G446S, completely abolishes the specific RNA binding. CONCLUSIONS: These observations, showing that MDM2 binds the L5/5S ribosomal ribonucleoprotein particle and can also bind to specific RNA sequences or structures, suggest a role for MDM2 in translational regulation in a cell.",

We found previously that protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta) can phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 in a signalling complex [van Dijk, Hilkmann and van Blitterswijk (1997) Biochem. J. 325, 303-307]. We report now that PKC-zeta-Raf-1 interaction is mediated by 14-3-3 proteins in vitro and in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in COS cells revealed that complex formation between PKC-zeta and Raf-1 is mediated strongly by the 14-3-3beta and -theta; isotypes, but not by 14-3-3zeta. Far-Western blotting revealed that 14-3-3 binds PKC-zeta directly at its regulatory domain, where a S186A mutation in a putative 14-3-3-binding domain strongly reduced the binding and the complex formation with 14-3-3beta and Raf-1. Treatment of PKC-zeta with lambda protein phosphatase also reduced its binding to 14-3-3beta in vitro. Preincubation of an immobilized Raf-1 construct with 14-3-3beta facilitated PKC-zeta binding. Together, the results suggest that 14-3-3 binds both PKC-zeta (at phospho-Ser-186) and Raf-1 in a ternary complex. Complex formation was much stronger with a kinase-inactive PKC-zeta mutant than with wild-type PKC-zeta, supporting the idea that kinase activity leads to complex dissociation. 14-3-3beta and -&theta; were substrates for PKC-zeta, whereas 14-3-3zeta was not. Phosphorylation of 14-3-3beta by PKC-zeta negatively regulated their physical association. 14-3-3beta with its putative PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites mutated enhanced co-precipitation between PKC-zeta and Raf-1, suggesting that phosphorylation of 14-3-3 by PKC-zeta weakens the complex in vivo. We conclude that 14-3-3 facilitates coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 in an isotype-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner. We suggest that 14-3-3 is a transient mediator of Raf-1 phosphorylation and activation by PKC-zeta.",

In LQT2 families, we identified three novel heterozygous HERG mutations (G965X, R1014PfsX39, V1038AfsX21) in the C-terminus that led to protein truncation and loss of a PKA phosphorylation site required for binding of 14-3-3epsilon. When expressed in CHO cells, the mutants produced functional HERG channels with normal kinetic properties. We now provide evidence that HERG channel regulation by 14-3-3epsilon is of physiological significance in humans. Upon co-expression with 14-3-3epsilon, mutant channels still bound 14-3-3epsilon but did not respond with a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependence as seen in wild-type channels. Co-expression experiments of wild-type and mutant channels revealed dominant-negative behavior of all three HERG mutations. Simulations of the effects of sympathetic stimulation of HERG channel activity on the whole-cell action potential suggested a role in rate-dependent control of APD and an impaired ability of mutant cardiac myocytes to respond to a triggered event or an ectopic beat. In summary, the attenuated functional effects of 14-3-3epsilon on C-terminally truncated HERG channels demonstrate the physiological importance of coupling beta-adrenergic stimulation and HERG channel activity.",

The tight junctional localization and Mg(2+) transport of CLDN-16 are regulated by cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Here, we examined whether PKA phosphorylates CLDN-16 in a direct or indirect manner. CLDN-16 was stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using a Tet-OFF system. The phosphorylation of CLDN-16 is upregulated by fetal calf serum (FCS). This phosphorylation was completely inhibited by a PKA inhibitor, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride. Without FCS, dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) increased the phosphoserine level of CLDN-16 in a concentration-dependent manner. The phosphorylated CLDN-16 elicited increases of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and transepithelial transport of Mg(2+). Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was also phosphorylated in the presence of FCS or DBcAMP. In the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull down assay, a cytosolic carboxyl domain of CLDN-16 was associated with PKA, but not with VASP. Furthermore, PKA was immunoprecipitated with CLDN-16 in MDCK cells, but VASP was not. In cells expressing a dephosphorylated mutant (Ser160Ala) of VASP, CLDN-16 was phosphorylated by DBcAMP and was associated with ZO-1, a tight junctional-scaffolding protein, without integral cell-cell junctions. We suggest that PKA directly phosphorylates CLDN-16, resulting in the localization to tight junctions (TJs) and the maintenance of Mg(2+) reabsorption.",

We found previously that RGS16 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation on conserved tyrosine residues in the RGS box. Phosphorylation on Tyr(168) was mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We show here that endogenous RGS16 is phosphorylated after epidermal growth factor stimulation of MCF-7 cells. In addition, p60-Src or Lyn kinase phosphorylated recombinant RGS16 in vitro, and RGS16 underwent phosphorylation in the presence of constitutively active Src (Y529F) in EGFR(-) CHO-K1 cells. Blockade of endogenous Src activity by selective inhibitors attenuated RGS16 phosphorylation induced by pervanadate or receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the rate of RGS16 degradation was reduced in cells expressing active Src or treated with pervanadate or a G protein-coupled receptor ligand (CXCL12). Induction of RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation was associated with increased RGS16 protein levels and enhanced GAP activity in cell membranes.

However, LPAAT-\u03b2 is now being studied as an important regulator of cell growth and differentiation and as a potential therapeutic target in cancer since PA is necessary for the activity of key proteins such as Raf, PKC-\u03b6 and mTOR. In this report we determine the effect of LPAAT-\u03b2 silencing with siRNA in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. We show for the first time that LPAAT-\u03b2 knockdown inhibits proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells. This is associated with inhibition of signaling by mTOR as determined by levels of mTORC1- and mTORC2-specific phosphorylation sites on 4E-BP1, S6K and Akt. Since PA regulates the activity of mTOR by modulating its binding to FKBP38, we explored the possibility that LPAAT-\u03b2 might regulate mTOR by affecting its association with FKBP38. Coimmunoprecipitation studies of FKBP38 with mTOR show increased levels of FKBP38 associated with mTOR when LPAAT-\u03b2 protein levels are knocked down. Furthermore, depletion of LPAAT-\u03b2 results in increased Lipin 1 nuclear localization which is associated with increased nuclear eccentricity, a nuclear shape change that is dependent on mTOR, further confirming the ability of LPAAT-\u03b2 to regulate mTOR function. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that PA generated by LPAAT-\u03b2 regulates mTOR signaling. We discuss the implications of these findings for using LPAAT-\u03b2 as a therapeutic target.",

To identify alpha(IIb) residues involved in alpha(IIb)beta(3) ligand binding function, cells expressing a constitutively active variant of alpha(IIb)beta(3) were randomly mutagenized and selected for loss of alpha(IIb)beta(3) ligand binding function. One mutant isolated in this manner contained a single amino acid substitution at position 96 in alpha(IIb) (Ser9-->Leu). Cells expressing this alpha(IIb) mutant did not bind the ligand mimetic antibody PAC1 or adhere to fibrinogen. In addition, the mutant receptor did not bind to an RGD affinity matrix. Substitution of conserved serine residues at position 1 in beta strand A of all seven repeats of alpha(IIb) similarly inhibited ligand binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). alpha(IIb)S96 maps to the central cavity of the beta-propeller fold of the alpha(IIb) subunit immediately adjacent to a structurally important sequence at the center of the alphaand beta subunit interface.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements provided evidence that both the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-AR can form homo-oligomers with similar transfer efficiency of approximately 0.10. Hetero-oligomers could also be observed between the alpha 1b- and the alpha 1a-AR subtypes but not between the alpha 1b-AR and the beta2-AR, the NK1 tachykinin, or the CCR5 chemokine receptors. Oligomerization of the alpha 1b-AR did not require the integrity of its C-tail, of two glycophorin motifs, or of the N-linked glycosylation sites at its N terminus. In contrast, helix I and, to a lesser extent, helix VII were found to play a role in the alpha 1b-AR homo-oligomerization. Receptor oligomerization was not influenced by the agonist epinephrine or by the inverse agonist prazosin. A constitutively active (A293E) as well as a signaling-deficient (R143E) mutant displayed oligomerization features similar to those of the wild type alpha 1b-AR. Confocal imaging revealed that oligomerization of the alpha1-AR subtypes correlated with their ability to co-internalize upon exposure to the agonist. The alpha 1a-selective agonist oxymetazoline induced the co-internalization of the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-AR, whereas the alpha 1b-AR could not co-internalize with the NK1 tachykinin or CCR5 chemokine receptors. Oligomerization might therefore represent an additional mechanism regulating the physiological responses mediated by the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-AR subtypes.",

Plk3 physically interacts with Cdc25C and phosphorylates this protein phosphatase predominantly on serine 216 (Ouyang, B., Li, W., Pan, H., Meadows, J., Hoffmann, I., and Dai, W.

Here we show that ectopic expression of a kinase-active Plk3 (Plk3-A) induced apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, the kinase activity of Plk3 was rapidly increased in an ATM-dependent manner, whereas that of Plk1 was markedly inhibited. Recombinant Plk3 phosphorylated in vitro a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing p53, but not glutathione S-transferase alone. Recombinant Plk1 also phosphorylated p53 but on residues that differed from those targeted by Plk3. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays demonstrated that Plk3 physically interacted with p53 and that this interaction was enhanced upon DNA damage. In vitro kinase assays followed by immunoblotting showed that serine 20 of p53 was a target of Plk3. Furthermore, expression of a kinase-defective Plk3 mutant (Plk3(K52R)) resulted in significant reduction of p53 phosphorylation on serine 20, which was correlated with a decrease in the expression of p21 and with a concomitant increase in cell proliferation. These results strongly suggest that Plk3 functionally links DNA damage to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the p53 pathway.",

In contrast, a green fluorescent protein-arfophilin-2 chimera or arfophilin-2 deletions were localized around the centrosome in a region that was also enriched for transferrin receptors and Rab11 but not early endosome markers, suggesting that the distribution of the endosomal recycling compartment was altered. The arfophilins belong to a conserved family that includes Drosophila melanogaster nuclear fallout, a centrosomal protein required for cellularization. Expression of green fluorescent protein-nuclear fallout in HeLa cells resulted in a similar phenotype, indicative of functional homology and thus implicating the arfophilins in mitosis/cytokinesis.

Consistent with this, E21R decreased the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). E21R-induced apoptosis was independent of Fas/APO-1 (CD95) and required interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)-like proteases. In contrast, Bcl-2, which protects cells from growth factor deprivation-induced cell death, did not prevent this apoptosis. These findings demonstrate the GM-CSF receptor and ICE-like protease requirements for E21R-induced apoptosis.",

The receptor is known to activate phospholipase C via the heterotrimeric G proteins Gq/11, but we showed previously that it can also signal through the phospholipase D (PLD) pathway in an ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-dependent manner that seems to be independent of Gq/11 (Mitchell et al., 1998). Both coimmunoprecipitation experiments and the effects of negative mutant ARF constructs on 5-HT2AR-induced PLD activation here suggested that ARF1 may play a greater role than ARF6 in the function of this receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrated using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins of receptor domains that ARF1 and ARF6 bind to the third intracellular loop (i3) and the carboxy terminal tail (ct) of the 5-HT2AR. The association of ARF1 with the ct domain of the receptor was stronger than its interaction with i3, or the interactions of ARF6 with either construct. Experiments using ARF mutants that are deficient in GTP loading, and the in vitro addition of GTPgammaS suggested that GTP loading enhances ARF1 binding to the receptor. The N376PxxY motif in the transmembrane 7 domain of the receptor (rather than a N376DPxxY mutant form) was shown to be essential for ARF-dependent PLD signaling and ARF1 coimmunoprecipitation. In GST-fusion proteins of the 5-HT2AR ct domain, mutation of Asn376 to Asp also markedly reduced ARF1-HA binding, although additional motifs in the Asn376-Asn384 sequence and to a lesser extent elsewhere, seem also to contribute to the interaction.",

These Ca(2+) channels assemble in (hetero)tetrameric channel complexes with different functional characteristics regarding Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation, ion selectivity, and pharmacological block. Glutathione S-transferase pull-downs and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated an essential role of the intracellular N- and C-tails in TRPV5 channel assembly by physical interactions between N-N tails, C-C tails, and N-C-tails. Patch clamp analysis in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and (45)Ca(2+) uptake experiments in Xenopus laevis oocytes co-expressing TRPV5 wild-type and truncated proteins indicated that TRPV5 Delta N (deleted N-tail) and TRPV5 Delta C (deleted C-tail) decreased channel activity of wild-type TRPV5 in a dominant-negative manner, whereas TRPV5 Delta N Delta C (deleted N-tail/C-tail) did not affect TRPV5 activity. Oocytes co-expressing wild-type TRPV5 and TRPV5 Delta N or TRPV5 Delta C showed virtually no wild-type TRPV5 expression on the plasma membrane, whereas co-expression of wild-type TRPV5 and TRPV5 Delta N Delta C displayed normal channel surface expression. This indicates that TRPV5 trafficking toward the plasma membrane was disturbed by assembly with TRPV5 Delta N or TRPV5 Delta C but not with TRPV5 Delta N Delta C. TRPV5 channel assembly signals were refined between amino acid positions 64-77 and 596-601 in the N-tail and C-tail, respectively. Pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that N- or C-tail mutants lacking these critical assembly domains were unable to interact with tails of TRPV5. In conclusion, two domains in the N-tail (residues 64-77) and C-tail (residues 596-601) of TRPV5 are important for channel subunit assembly, subsequent trafficking of the TRPV5 channel complex to the plasma membrane, and channel activity.",

Direct sequencing of SNTA1, the gene encoding alpha1-syntrophin, was performed in a cohort of LQTS patients that were negative for mutations in the 11 known LQTS-susceptibility genes. A missense mutation (A390V-SNTA1) was found in a patient with recurrent syncope and markedly prolonged QT interval (QTc, 530 ms). SNTA1 links neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the nNOS inhibitor plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b (PMCA4b); SNTA1 also is known to associate with the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A. By using a GST-fusion protein of the C terminus of SCN5A, we showed that WT-SNTA1 interacted with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b. In contrast, A390V-SNTA1 selectively disrupted association of PMCA4b with this complex and increased direct nitrosylation of SCN5A. A390V-SNTA1 expressed with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b in heterologous cells increased peak and late sodium current compared with WT-SNTA1, and the increase was partially inhibited by NOS blockers. Expression of A390V-SNTA1 in cardiac myocytes also increased late sodium current. We conclude that the A390V mutation disrupted binding with PMCA4b, released inhibition of nNOS, caused S-nitrosylation of SCN5A, and was associated with increased late sodium current, which is the characteristic biophysical dysfunction for sodium-channel-mediated LQTS (LQT3). These results establish an SNTA1-based nNOS complex attached to SCN5A as a key regulator of sodium current and suggest that SNTA1 be considered a rare LQTS-susceptibility gene.",

In the present study, we used protein arrays spotted with 5000 recombinant human proteins for a large scale interaction analysis of monomeric versus oligomeric alpha-synuclein. Monomeric alpha-synuclein bound to arrayed cAMP regulated phosphoprotein 19 and binding appears to be disrupted by alpha-synuclein oligomerization. Incubation with recombinant alpha-synuclein oligomers lead to the identification of several GTPase activating proteins and Cdc42 effector proteins as binding partners. Protein database searches revealed a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain in some interactors. To demonstrate in vivo relevance, we analyzed brainstem protein extracts from alpha-synuclein(A30P) transgenic mice. Pull-down assays using beads conjugated with a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain lead to an enrichment of endogenous alpha-synuclein oligomers. Cdc42 effector proteins were also co-immunoprecipitated with alpha-synuclein from brainstem lysates and were colocalized with alpha-synuclein aggregates in brain sections by double immunostaining. By two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of synaptosomal fractions from transgenic mouse brains we detected additional isoforms of septin 6, a downstream target of Cdc42 effector proteins. Small GTPases have recently been identified in a genetic modifier screen to suppress alpha-synuclein toxicity in yeast.

To determine the functional consequences of SUMO modification, we compared the transcriptional activity of p68 and a K53R mutant that could not be SUMO-modified. Our data show that SUMO modification enhances p68 transcriptional repression activity and inhibits the ability of p68 to function as a coactivator of p53.

Its function in apoptosis is associated with the proteolytic cleavage to the truncated form tBid, mainly by caspase-8. tBid translocates to mitochondria and assists Bax and Bak in induction of apoptosis. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent alternative processing of Bid to jBid was also reported. We have previously shown that the folate stress enzyme 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1) activates JNK1 and JNK2 in cancer cells as a pro-apoptotic response. Here we report that in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, JNK1/2 phosphorylate Bid at Thr59 within the caspase cleavage site in response to ALDH1L1. In vitro, all three JNK isoforms, JNK 1-3, phosphorylated Thr59 of Bid with JNK1 being the least active. Thr59 phosphorylation protected Bid from cleavage by caspase-8, resulting in strong accumulation of the full-length protein and its translocation to mitochondria. Interestingly, although we did not observe jBid in response to ALDH1L1 in PC-3 cells, transient expression of Bid mutants lacking the caspase-8 cleavage site resulted in strong accumulation of jBid. Of note, a T59D mutant mimicking constitutive phosphorylation revealed more profound cleavage of Bid to jBid. JNK-driven Bid accumulation had a pro-apoptotic effect in our study: small interfering RNA silencing of either JNK1/2 or Bid prevented Bid phosphorylation and accumulation, and rescued ALDH1L1-expressing cells. As full-length Bid is a weaker apoptogen than tBid, we propose that the phosphorylation of Bid by JNKs, followed by the accumulation of the full-length protein, delays attainment of apoptosis, and allows the cell to evaluate the stress and make a decision regarding the response strategy. This mechanism perhaps can be modified by the alternative cleavage of phospho-T59 Bid to jBid at some conditions.",

No interaction occurs with the corresponding long splice variants which do not contain the E S V/I K I motif. The PDZ domain of PICK1 is required for the interaction and the mutation of a single amino acid in this region (Lys-27 to Glu) prevents interaction between PICK1 and GluR2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. A similar mutation has been reported to prevent the binding of PICK1 to PKC alpha indicating that the same domain of PICK1 binds both PKC alpha and GluRs. Flag-tagged PICK1 is retained by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of the C-terminal of GluR2 (GST-ct-GluR2; short splice variant) but not by GST-ct-GluR1 (long splice variant). Recombinant full length GluR2 is coimmunoprecipitated with flag-PICK1 using an anti-flag antibody and flag-PICK1 is coimmunoprecipitated with an N-terminal directed anti-GluR2 antibody. Transient expression of both proteins in COS cells reveals colocalization and an altered pattern of distribution for each protein from when they are expressed individually.

Using immortalized and cancer cell lines, retroviral expression of a phosphomimetic (S209D) form of eIF4E, but not phospho-dead (S209A) eIF4E or GFP control, significantly increased cellular resistance to stress induced by DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin), starvation (glucose+glutamine withdrawal), and oxidative stress (arsenite). De novo accumulation of eIF4E-containing cytoplasmic bodies colocalizing with the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T was observed after expression of phosphomimetic S209D, but not S209A or wild-type eIF4E. Increased resistance to cellular stress induced by eIF4E-S209D was lost upon knockdown of endogenous 4E-T or use of an eIF4E-W73A-S209D mutant unable to bind 4E-T. Cancer cells treated with the Mnk1/2 inhibitor CGP57380 to prevent eIF4E phosphorylation and mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Mnk1/2 knockout mice were also more sensitive to arsenite and cisplatin treatment. Polysome analysis revealed an 80S peak 2 hours after arsenite treatment in cells overexpressing phosphomimetic eIF4E, indicating translational stalling. Nonetheless, a selective increase was observed in the synthesis of some proteins (cyclin D1, HuR, and Mcl-1). We conclude that phosphorylation of eIF4E confers resistance to various cell stressors and that a direct interaction or regulation of 4E-T by eIF4E is required. Further delineation of this process may identify novel therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment, and these results support the use of modern Mnk1/2 inhibitors in conjunction with standard therapy.",

Eos recruited to the airways after allergen exposure produce and respond to IL-5 and GM-CSF, enhancing their survival. Prosurvival signaling activates Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that binds to Bax and prevents its activation. How long-lived Eos, despite the continued presence of GM-CSF or IL-5, eventually undergo apoptosis to end allergic inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we show that Pin1 location, activity, and protein interactions are jointly influenced by Fas and the prosurvival cytokine IL-5. Fas signaling strongly induced the phosphorylation of FADD at Ser(194) and Pin1 at Ser(16), as well as their nuclear accumulation. Phospho-mimic Ser(194)Glu FADD mutants accelerated Eos apoptosis compared with wild-type or Ser(194)Ala mutants. Downstream of FADD phosphorylation, caspase 8, 9, and 3 cleavage, as well as Eos apoptosis induced by Fas, were reduced by constitutively active Pin1 and enhanced by Pin1 inhibition. Pin1 was activated by IL-5, whereas simultaneous IL-5 and anti-Fas treatment modestly reduced peptidyl isomerase activity but induced Pin1 to associate with FADD after its phosphorylation at Ser(194). Mechanistically, Pin1-mediated isomerization facilitated the subsequent dephosphorylation of Ser(194) FADD and maintenance of cytoplasmic location. In vivo-activated bronchoalveolar Eos obtained after allergen challenge showed elevated survival and Pin1 activity that could be reversed by anti-Fas. Therefore, our data suggest that Pin1 is a critical link between FADD-mediated cell death and IL-5-mediated prosurvival signaling.",

In the present study, we demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of CXCR2 physically interacts with the PP2A core enzyme, a dimer formed by PP2Ac and PR65, but not with the PP2Ac monomer, suggesting direct interaction of the receptor with PR65. The integrity of a sequence motif in the C terminus of CXCR2, KFRHGL, which is conserved in all CC and CXC chemokine receptors, is required for the receptor binding to the PP2A core enzyme. CXCR2 co-immunoprecipitates with the PP2A core enzyme in HEK293 cells and in human neutrophils. Overexpression of dominant negative dynamin 1 (dynamin 1 K44A) in CXCR2-expressing cells blocks the receptor association with the PP2A core enzyme, and an internalization-deficient mutant form of CXCR2 (I323A,L324A) also exhibits impaired association with the PP2A core enzyme, suggesting that the receptor internalization is required for the receptor binding to PP2A. A phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR2 (331T), which has previously been shown to undergo internalization in HEK293 cells, binds to an almost equal amount of the PP2A core enzyme in comparison with the wild-type CXCR2, suggesting that the interaction of the receptor with PP2A is phosphorylation-independent. The dephosphorylation of CXCR2 is reversed by treatment of the cells with okadaic acid. Moreover, pretreatment of the cells with okadaic acid increases basal phosphorylation of CXCR2 and attenuates CXCR2-mediated calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. Taken together, these data indicate that PP2A is involved in the dephosphorylation of CXCR2. We postulate that this interaction results from direct binding of the regulatory subunit A (PR65) of PP2A to the carboxyl terminus of CXCR2 after receptor sequestration and internalization.",

Pox viruses of the Orf family encode highly related proteins called VEGF-E that show only 25-35% amino acid identity with VEGF-A but bind with comparable affinity to VEGFR-2. The crystal structure of VEGF-E NZ2 described here reveals high similarity to the known structural homologs VEGF-A, PlGF, and the snake venoms Vammin and VR-1, which are all homodimers and contain the characteristic cysteine knot motif. Distinct conformational differences are observed in loop L1 and particularly in L3, which contains a highly flexible GS-rich motif that differs from all other structural homologs. Based on our structure, we created chimeric proteins by exchanging selected segments in L1 and L3 with the corresponding sequences from PlGF. Single loop mutants did not bind to either receptor, whereas a VEGF-E mutant in which both L1 and L3 were replaced gained affinity for VEGFR-1, illustrating the possibility to engineer receptor-specific chimeric VEGF molecules. In addition, changing arginine 46 to isoleucine in L1 significantly increased the affinity of VEGF-E for both VEGF receptors.",

Since T-cells undergo activation induced cell death via Fas activation, it was of interest to determine if this pathway was also affected by CEACAM1. Previously, we identified a novel biochemical interaction between CEACAM1 and the armadillo repeats of \u03b2-catenin in Jurkat cells, in which two critical residues, H469 and K470 of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4L played an essential role; while in other studies, \u03b2-catenin was shown to regulate Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. CEACAM1 expression in Jurkat cells leads to the re-distribution of \u03b2-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton as well as inhibition of \u03b2-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and its degradation after Fas stimulation. As a result, Fas-mediated apoptosis in these cells was inhibited. The K470A mutation of CEACAM1 partially rescued the inhibitory effect, in agreement with the prediction that a CEACAM1-\u03b2-catenin interaction pathway is involved. Although CEACAM1 has two ITIMs, they were not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Fas ligation, indicating an ITIM independent mechanism; however, mutation of the critical residue S508, located between the ITIMs, to aspartic acid and a prerequisite for ITIM activation, abrogates the inhibitory activity of CEACAM1 to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Since Fas-mediated apoptosis is a major form of activation-induced cell death, our finding supports the idea that CEACAM1 is a general inhibitory molecule for T-cell activation utilizing a variety of pathways.",

We show that the CAV VP2 amino acid sequence has some similarity to a number of eukaryotic, receptor, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) alpha proteins as well as to a cluster of human TT viruses within the Sanban group. To investigate if CAV VP2 functions as a PTPase, purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-VP2 fusion protein was assayed for PTPase activity using the generalized peptide substrates ENDpYINASL and DADEpYLIPQQG (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. CAV GST-VP2 was shown to catalyze dephosphorylation of both substrates. CAV GST-VP2 PTPase activity for the ENDpYINASL substrate had a V(max) of 14,925 units/mg.min and a K(m) of 18.88 microm. Optimal activity was observed between pH 6 and 7, and activity was specifically inhibited by 0.01 mm orthovanadate. We also show that the ORF2 sequence of the CAV-related human virus TT-like minivirus (TLMV) possessed PTPase activity and steady state kinetics equivalent to CAV GST-VP2 when expressed as a GST fusion protein. To establish whether these viral proteins were dual specificity protein phosphatases, the CAV GST-VP2 and TLMV GST-ORF2 fusion proteins were also assayed for serine/threonine phosphatase (S/T PPase) activity using the generalized peptide substrate RRApTVA, with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. Both CAV GST-VP2 and TLMV GST-ORF2 fusion proteins possessed S/T PPase activity, which was specifically inhibited by 50 mm sodium fluoride. CAV GST-VP2 exhibited S/T PPase activity with a V(max) of 28,600 units/mg.min and a K(m) of 76 microm. Mutagenesis of residue Cys(95) to serine in CAV GST-VP2 abrogated both PTPase and S/T PPase activity, identifying it as the catalytic cysteine within the proposed signature motif. These studies thus show that the circoviruses CAV and TLMV encode dual specificity protein phosphatases (DSP) with an unusual signature motif that may play a role in intracellular signaling during viral replication. This is the first DSP gene to be identified in a small viral genome.",

Herein, we have attempted to determine which autophosphorylated tyrosine residue on the VEGFR-2 is essential for VEGF-mediated endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and NO production from endothelial cells. Tyrosine residues 801, 1175, and 1214 of the VEGFR-2 were mutated to phenylalanine, and the mutated receptors were analyzed for their ability to stimulate NO production. We show, both in COS-7 cells cotransfected with the VEGFR-2 mutants and eNOS and in bovine aortic endothelial cells, that the Y801F-VEGFR-2 mutant is unable to stimulate NO synthesis and eNOS activation in contrast to the wild type, Y1175F-VEGFR-2, and Y1214F-VEGFR-2. However, the Y801F mutant retains the capacity to activate phospholipase C-gamma in contrast to the Y1175F-VEGFR-2. Interestingly, the Y801F-VEGFR-2, in contrast to the wild type receptor, does not fully activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or recruit the p85 subunit upon receptor activation. This results in a complete incapacity of the Y801F-VEGFR-2 to stimulate Akt activation and eNOS phosphorylation on serine 1179 in endothelial cells. In addition, constitutive activation of Akt or a phosphomimetic mutant of eNOS (S1179D) fully rescues the inability of the Y801F-VEGFR-2 to induce NO release. Finally, we generated an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of tyrosine 801 of the VEGFR-2 and demonstrate that this residue is actively phosphorylated in response to VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells. We thus conclude that autophosphorylation of tyrosine residue 801 of the VEGFR-2 is essential for VEGF-stimulated NO production from endothelial cells, and this is primarily accomplished via the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt signaling to eNOS.",

This is demonstrated by measuring relative luciferase activities of p21 promoter constructs with p53 or Sp1 binding site mutagenesis and was further confirmed by transfection of wild-type p53 into H1299 cells (p53 null). That p53 was acetylated after depsipeptide treatment was tested by sequential immunoprecipitation/Western immunoblot analysis with anti-acetylated lysines and anti-p53 antibodies. The acetylated p53 has a longer half-life due to a significant decrease in p53 ubiquitination. Further study using site-specific antiacetyllysine antibodies and transfection of mutated p53 vectors (K319/K320/K321R mutated and K373R/K382R mutations) into H1299 cells revealed that depsipeptide specifically induces p53 acetylation at K373/K382, but not at K320. As assayed by coimmunoprecipitation, the K373/K382 acetylation is accompanied by a recruitment of p300, but neither CREB-binding protein (CBP) nor p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), to the p53 C terminus. Furthermore, activity associated with the binding of the acetylated p53 at K373/K382 to the p21 promoter as well as p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression is significantly increased after depsipeptide treatment, as tested by chromatin immunoprecipitations and Western blotting, respectively. In addition, p53 acetylation at K373/K382 is confirmed to be required for recruitment of p300 to the p21 promoter, and the depsipeptide-induced p53 acetylation at K373/K382 is unlikely to be dependent on p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, Ser20, and Ser392 sites.

Like the corresponding fragment from CDC25Mm, the increase in the GDP dissociation rate is linear with increasing concentration of Rap1A x GDP up to 100 microM, indicating an apparent K(M) higher than 100 microM. Unlike the Ras-CDC25Mm system, the Rap1A(S17N) mutant does not inhibit the C3G-activated guanine nucleotide dissociation from wild-type Rap1A in vitro.

In addition, H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of p53 was followed by induction of p21, suggesting functional activation of p53. Induction of phosphorylation of p53 on multiple serine residues by H(2)O(2) was caffeine-sensitive and blocked in ATM(-/-) cells. Polo-like kinase-3 (Plk3) activity was also activated upon H(2)O(2) treatment, and this activation was ATM-dependent. Recombinant His(6)-Plk3 phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p53 fusion protein but not GST alone. When phoshorylated in vitro by His(6)-Plk3, but not by the kinase-defective mutant His6-Plk3(K52R), GST-p53 was recognized by an antibody specifically to serine 20-phosphorylated p53, indicating that serine 20 is an in vitro target of Plk3. Also serine 20-phosphorylated p53 was coimmunoprecipitated with Plk3 in cells treated with H(2)O(2). Furthermore, although H(2)O(2) strongly induced serine 15 phosphorylation of p53, it failed to induce serine 20 phosphorylation in Plk3-dificient Daudi cells. Ectopic expression of a Plk3 dominant negative mutant, Plk3(K52R), in GM00637 cells suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced serine 20 phosphorylation. Taken together, our studies strongly suggest that the oxidative stress-induced activation of p53 is at least in part mediated by Plk3.",

E2 is synthesized as a precursor, p62, which is processed to mature E2 by the cellular protease furin.

We have previously isolated SFV mutations that allow virus growth in furin-deficient cells. Here we have used such pci mutations to compare the interactions of the p62/E1 and E2/E1 dimers.

Using a multi-protease digestion approach, we identified a novel ubiquitination site and provide a detailed B-Raf phospho-map. Importantly, we identify two evolutionary conserved phosphorylation clusters around T401 and S419 in the B-Raf hinge region. SILAC labelling and genetic/biochemical follow-up revealed that these clusters are phosphorylated in the contexts of oncogenic Ras, sorafenib induced Raf dimerization and in the background of the V600E mutation. We further show that the vemurafenib sensitive phosphorylation of the T401 cluster occurs in trans within a Raf dimer. Substitution of the Ser/Thr-residues of this cluster by alanine residues enhances the transforming potential of B-Raf, indicating that these phosphorylation sites suppress its signaling output. Moreover, several B-Raf phosphorylation sites, including T401 and S419, are somatically mutated in tumors, further illustrating the importance of phosphorylation for the regulation of this kinase.",

The D25N mutation (PR(D25N)) increases the equilibrium dimer dissociation constant by a factor >100-fold (1.3 +/- 0.09 microm) relative to PR. In the absence of inhibitor, NMR studies reveal clear structural differences between PR and PR(D25N) in the relatively mobile P1 loop (residues 79-83) and flap regions, and differential scanning calorimetric analyses show that the mutation lowers the stabilities of both the monomer and dimer folds by 5 and 7.3 degrees C, respectively. Only minimal differences are observed in high resolution crystal structures of PR(D25N) complexed to darunavir (DRV), a potent clinical inhibitor, or a non-hydrolyzable substrate analogue, Ac-Thr-Ile-Nle-r-Nle-Gln-Arg-NH(2) (RPB), as compared with PR.DRV and PR.RPB complexes. Although complexation with RPB stabilizes both dimers, the effect on their T(m) is smaller for PR(D25N) (6.2 degrees C) than for PR (8.7 degrees C). The T(m) of PR(D25N).DRV increases by only 3 degrees C relative to free PR(D25N), as compared with a 22 degrees C increase for PR.DRV, and the mutation increases the ligand dissociation constant of PR(D25N).DRV by a factor of approximately 10(6) relative to PR.DRV.

On the other hand, in the Wnt-off state, the mitosis-specific CDK14-Cyclin Y kinase complex phosphorylates Ser-1490 of LRP5/6 at G2/M, thereby priming the receptor for Wnt-induced phosphorylation. However, it remains unclear how CDK14/Cyclin Y is recruited to LRP5/6 and whether there are other cofactors involved in this process. Previously, we identified Caprin-2 as a positive regulator of canonical Wnt signaling by promoting GSK3-depedent LRP5/6 phosphorylation upon Wnt stimulation. Here we uncovered that Caprin-2 positively regulates constitutive LRP5/6 Ser-1490 phosphorylation by complexing with CDK14/Cyclin Y. Caprin-2-mediated LRP5/6 phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent in a pattern similar to that of CDK14/Cyclin Y-dependent LRP5/6 phosphorylation. Moreover, knockdown of Caprin-2 disrupts not only the interaction between CDK14 and Cyclin Y but also the interaction between CDK14/Cyclin Y and LRP6. Overall, our findings revealed an unrecognized role of Caprin-2 in facilitating LRP5/6 constitutive phosphorylation at G2/M through forming a quaternary complex with CDK14, Cyclin Y, and LRP5/6.",

This is supported by the following observations: (1) phospho-Thr308 decreases when Ser129 is mutated to alanine, (2) this decrease is abolished by cell treatment with okadaic acid (to inactivate PP2A) or geldanamycin (to inactivate Hsp90), (3) phosphorylation of Ser129 neither enhances the activity of PDK1 nor hampers the in vitro activity of PP2A on Thr308, but increases the Hsp90 association to Akt.

Despite of tremendous research efforts, however, molecular mechanisms on AR regulation remain poorly understood, particularly for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Targeting AR and associated factors is considered an effective strategy in PCa treatment. METHODS: Human prostate cancer cells were used in this study. Manipulations of Skp2 expression were achieved by Skp2 shRNA/siRNA or overexpression of plasmids. Dual luciferase reporter assay was applied for AR activity assessment. Western blot, ubiquitination assay, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were applied to detect the proteins. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Skp2 directly involves the regulation of AR expression through ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Skp2 interacted with AR protein in PCa cells, and enforced expression of Skp2 resulted in a decreased level and activity of AR. By contrast, Skp2 knockdown increased the protein accumulation and activity of AR. Importantly, changes of AR contributed by Skp2 led to subsequent alterations of PSA level in PCa cells. AR ubiquitination was significantly increased upon Skp2 overexpression but greatly reduced upon Skp2 knockdown. AR mutant at K847R abrogated Skp2-mediated ubiquitination of AR. NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, remarkably inhibited Skp2 level with a striking elevation of AR. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that Skp2 is an E3 ligase for proteasome-dependent AR degradation, and K847 on AR is the recognition site for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. Our findings reveal an essential role of Skp2 in AR signaling.",

Here we report that Valosin-containing protein (VCP) directly binds to Dorfin and that VCP ATPase activity profoundly contributes to the E3 activity of Dorfin. High through-put analysis using mass spectrometry identified VCP as a candidate of Dorfin-associated protein. Glycerol gradient centrifugation analysis showed that endogenous Dorfin consisted of a 400-600-kDa complex and was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous VCP. In vitro experiments showed that Dorfin interacted directly with VCP through its C-terminal region. These two proteins were colocalized in aggresomes in HEK293 cells and UBIs in the affected neurons of ALS and PD. VCP(K524A), a dominant negative form of VCP, reduced the E3 activity of Dorfin against mutant superoxide dismutase 1, whereas it had no effect on the autoubiquitylation of Parkin.

Eleven independent isolates contained plasmids encoding the C-terminal tail of mitotic kinesin-like protein-1 (MKLP1). Further deletion mapping allowed the identification of an 88 amino acid Arf3 binding domain in the C-terminus of MKLP1.

          "text": "Nrf2 has an anti-carcinogenic effect. However, an increase in Nrf2 activity is also implicated in cancer chemoresistance. A switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin affects the transdifferentiation and metastasis of cancer cells. In view of the key role of this switch in cancer malignancy, we investigated the regulatory effect of E-cadherin on Nrf2. In HEK293 cells, overexpression of E-cadherin inhibited the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, and prevented Nrf2-dependent gene induction. GST pull-down and immunocytochemical assays verified the interaction between E-cadherin and Nrf2: E-cadherin bound the C-terminus of Nrf2, but not its N-terminus, which comprises the Neh2 domain responsible for phosphorylation of Ser40. Our finding that the mutation of Ser40 to alanine in Nrf2 did not affect the ability of E-cadherin to bind Nrf2 and repress target gene transactivation suggests that E-cadherin might not disturb the phosphorylation. Studies using mutant constructs of E-cadherin suggested that the \u03b2-catenin-binding domain contributes to the inhibitory effect of E-cadherin on Nrf2. Consistently, knockdown of \u03b2-catenin attenuated not only the effect of E-cadherin binding to Nrf2, but also Keap1-dependent ubiquitylation of Nrf2, and thereby increased Nrf2 activity, supporting the involvement of \u03b2-catenin in the interactions. Collectively, E-cadherin recruits Nrf2 through \u03b2-catenin, and assists the function of Keap1 for the inhibition of nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of Nrf2. In HepG2 cells, the loss of E-cadherin by either siRNA knockdown or treatment with TGF\u03b21 enhanced the constitutive or inducible activity of Nrf2, implying that chemoresistance of cancer cells upon the loss of E-cadherin might be associated with Nrf2.",

Recently, we reported that ZBP-89 cooperates with histone acetyltransferase coactivator p300 in the regulation of p21(waf1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor whose associated gene is a target gene of p53. Therefore, we examined whether ZBP-89 might also inhibit cell growth by activating p53. In the present study, we demonstrate that elevated levels of ZBP-89 induce growth arrest and apoptosis in human gastrointestinal cell lines. The ZBP-89 protein accumulated within 4 h, and the p53 protein accumulated within 16 h, of serum starvation without changes in p14ARF levels, demonstrating a physiological increase in the cellular levels of these two proteins. Overexpression of ZBP-89 stabilized the p53 protein and enhanced its transcriptional activity through direct protein-protein interactions. The DNA binding and C-terminal domains of p53 and the zinc finger domain of ZBP-89 mediated the interaction. A point mutation in the p53 DNA binding domain, R273H, greatly reduced ZBP-89-mediated stabilization but not their physical interaction. Furthermore, ZBP-89 formed a complex with p53 and MDM2 and therefore did not prevent the MDM2-p53 interaction. However, heterokaryon assays demonstrated that ZBP-89 retained p53 in the nucleus. Collectively, these data indicate that ZBP-89 regulates cell proliferation in part through its ability to directly bind the p53 protein and retard its nuclear export. Our findings further our understanding of how ZBP-89 modulates cell proliferation and reveals a novel mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized.",

The sequence mzFKBP-66 is expressed ubiquitously in the maize plant, and the protein encoded is present in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments within the cell. Both the native mzFKBP-66 and a recombinant protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli showed peptidylproline cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity at rates comparable to those reported for mammalian immunophilins. This activity was also sensitive to inhibition by FK506. Immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-mzFKBP66 demonstrated an association of the protein with an unknown 36-kDa polypeptide, and affinity chromatography of mzFKBP-66 on calmodulin-agarose beads indicated the presence of a calmodulin-binding site.

The lipid phosphoinositol phosphatase activity is essential for PTEN to block the cell cycle in the G1 phase and thereby to suppress tumor formation and progression (Cantley, L. C., and Neel, B. G. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 4240-4245), although the mechanisms governing PTEN activity under normal and neoplastic growth conditions remain unclear. Here, we report that PTEN interacts physically and functionally with PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates gene transcription through interaction with p300/CBP and various sequence-specific transcription factors (Nakatani, Y. (2001) Genes Cells 6, 79-86). Expression of PCAF results in increased acetylation of lysine residues (Lys125 and Lys128) within the catalytic cleft of PTEN, a structure essential for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate specificity (Lee, J. O., Yang, H., Georgescu, M. M., Di Cristofano, A., Maehama, T., Shi, Y., Dixon, J. E., Pandolfi, P., and Pavletich, N. P. (1999) Cell 99, 323-334). The acetylation of PTEN caused by PCAF expression depends on the presence of growth factors. Reduction of endogenous PCAF activity using shRNA results in a loss of PTEN acetylation in response to growth factors and restores the ability of PTEN to down-regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and to induce G1 cell cycle arrest. The retention of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling and cell cycle regulatory activities of acetylation-resistant PTEN K125R and K128R mutants in the presence of enforced PCAF expression suggest a causal relationship. Together, these findings indicate a mechanism of PTEN regulation that forges a link between distinct cancer-relevant pathways central to the control of growth factor signaling and gene expression.",

However, the distinctive arrangement of charged residues at the dimer-dimer interface suggests that they also contribute to tetramer stability. Charge-reversal mutations at positions 343, 346, and 351 within the dimer-dimer interface were thus introduced into p53tet constructs and shown to result in the selective formation of a stable heterotetramer composed of homodimers. More precisely, mutants p53tet-E343K/E346K and p53tet-K351E preferentially associated with each other, but not with wild-type p53tet, to form a heterodimeric tetramer with enhanced thermal stability relative to either of the two components in isolation. The p53tet-E343K/E346K mutant alone assembled into a weakly stable tetramer in solution, whereas p53tet-K351E existed only as a dimer. Moreover, these mutants did not form heterocomplexes with wild-type p53tet, illustrating the specificity of the ionic interactions that form the novel heterotetramer. This study demonstrates the dramatic importance of ionic interactions in altering the stability of the p53 tetramer and in selectively creating heterotetramers of this protein scaffold.",

The exodomain binds the hormone with high affinity, and the resulting hormone/exodomain complex modulates the endodomain where receptor activation occurs. It has been an enigma whether the hormone interacts with the endodomain. In a step to address the question, exoloop 3 of (580)KVPLITVSKAK(590) was examined by Ala scan, multiple substitution, assays for hormone binding, cAMP and inositol phosphate (IP) induction, and photoaffinity labeling. We present the evidence for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. A peptide mimic of exoloop 3 specifically and saturably photoaffinity-labels FSH alpha but not FSH beta. This is in contrast to photoaffinity labeling of FSH beta by the peptide mimic of the N-terminal region of the receptor. Leu(583) and Ile(584) are crucial for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. Substitutions of these two residues enhanced the hormone binding affinity. This is due to the loss of the original side chains but not the introduction of new side chains. The Leu(583) and Ile(584) side chains appear to project in opposite directions. Ile(584) appears to be so specific and to require flexibility and stereo specificity so that no other amino acids can fit into its place. Leu(583) is less specific. The improvement in hormone binding by substitutions was offset by the severe impairment of signal generation of cAMP and/or inositol phosphate. For example, the Phe or Tyr substitution of Leu(583) improved the hormone binding and cAMP induction but impaired IP induction. On the other hand, the substitutions for Ile(584) and Lys(590) abolished the cAMP and IP induction. Our results open a logical question whether Leu(583), Ile(584), and Lys(590) interact with the exodomain and/or the hormone. The answers will provide new insights into the mechanisms of hormone binding and signal generation.",

We had previously reported that a truncated version of Der3p, Der3deltaRp, lacking 111 residues of the lumenal domain including the RING finger motif is not functional, suggesting the involvement of this domain in the function of the protein in ER degradation. We substantiated this hypothesis by constructing a mutated form of Der3/Hrd1p replacing the last cysteine of the motif with a serine. This mutated Der3(C399S) protein maintains the correct localization and topology of the wild-type protein, however, is not able to support the degradation of soluble and integral membrane proteins. This point mutation altering the RING-H2 motif behaves as a dominant allele especially when overexpressed from a 2mu plasmid by this increasing the half-life of CPY* more than 6-fold when compared with a wild-type strain. Furthermore coexpression of der3(C399S) with the wild-type allele is also able to partially suppress the temperature sensitive growth phenotype of a sec61-2 strain. Finally we have shown that overexpression of Hrd3p suppresses the dominant effect of the der3(C399S) mutation.

Although the heart is a target organ of insulin, few studies have examined the mechanisms by which beta-adrenergic stimulation affects insulin sensitivity in cardiac muscle. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the cross-talk between beta adrenergic and insulin receptors in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and in transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Akt (E40K Tg). The results of this study show that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation has a biphasic effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Short-term stimulation induces an additive effect on insulin-induced glucose uptake, and this effect is mediated by phosphorylation of Akt in threonine 308 through PKA/Ca2+-dependent and PI3K-independent pathway, whereas insulin-evoked threonine phosphorylation of Akt is exclusively PI3K-dependent. On the other hand, long-term stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors inhibits both insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, and at the same time promotes threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. This is mediated by serine 473 phosphorylation of Akt through PKA/Ca2+ and PI3K-dependent pathways. Under basal conditions, E40K Tg mice show increased levels of threonine phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor and blunted tyrosine autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor after insulin stimulation. These results indicate that, in cardiomyocytes, beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation impairs insulin signaling transduction machinery through an Akt-dependent pathway, suggesting that Akt is critically involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity.",

In this study we report the interaction of alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1 in human neuroglioma cells using a sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique.

While proteasome dysfunction is observed in PD, diverse mutations in the parkin gene are linked to early-onset autosomal-recessive forms of familial PD. We demonstrate that parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, activates the 26S proteasome in an E3 ligase activity-independent manner. Furthermore, an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain within parkin is critical for the activation of the 26S proteasome through enhancing the interaction between 19S proteasomal subunits, whereas the PD-linked R42P mutant abolishes this action. The current findings point to a novel role for parkin for 26S proteasome assembly and suggest that parkin mutations contribute to the proteasomal dysfunction in PD.",

We show here that the E3 activity of c-Cbl is negatively regulated by other domains present in the amino-terminal half of the protein (the TKB and linker helix domains) and that this negative regulation is removed when the protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Protease digestion studies indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation alters the conformation of c-Cbl. We also show that mutation of certain conserved tyrosine residues to glutamate can constitutively activate the E3 activity of c-Cbl. In particular, a Y371E mutant shows constitutive E3 activity while retaining the ability to bind epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The Y371E mutant also has altered protease sensitivity from wild type, instead resembling the proteolytic pattern seen with tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl. Mutation of the homologous tyrosine residue in Cbl-b to glutamate also leads to E3 activation while retaining EGFR-binding ability. These studies argue that Tyr-371 plays a key role in activating the E3 activity of c-Cbl and that the Y371E mutant may partially mimic phosphorylation at that site. However, Tyr-371 point mutants of c-Cbl are still able to undergo phosphorylation-induced E3 activation, and we show that Tyr-368 can also be phosphorylated in addition to Tyr-371, and contributes to activation.",

Following derivatization with N-(1-pyrene)maleimide at engineered sites (T34C and T110C) within the N- and C-domains of CaM, contact interactions between these opposing domains of CaM resulted in excimer fluorescence that permits us to monitor conformational states of bound CaM. Complementary measurements take advantage of the unique conserved Trp within CaM-binding sequences that functions as a hydrophobic anchor in CaM binding and permits measurements of both a local and global peptide structure. We find that CaM binds with high affinity in a collapsed structure to the CaM-binding sequences of both the Ca-ATPase and RyR1, resulting in excimer formation that is indicative of contact interactions between the N- and the C-domains of CaM in complex with these CaM-binding peptides. There is a 4-fold larger amount of excimer formation for CaM bound to the CaM-binding sequence of the Ca-ATPase in comparison to RyR1, indicating a closer structural coupling between CaM domains in this complex. Prior to CaM association, the CaM-binding sequences of the Ca-ATPase and RyR1 are conformationally disordered. Upon CaM association, the CaM-binding sequence of the Ca-ATPase assumes a highly ordered structure. In comparison, the CaM-binding sequence of RyR1 remains conformationally disordered irrespective of CaM binding. These results suggest an important role for interdomain contact interactions between the opposing domains of CaM in stabilizing the structure of the peptide complex. The substantially different structural responses associated with CaM binding to Ca-ATPase and RyR1 indicates a plasticity in their respective binding mechanisms that accomplishes different physical mechanisms of allosteric regulation, involving either the dissociation of a C-terminal regulatory domain necessary for pump activation or the modulation of intersubunit interactions to diminish RyR1 channel activity.",

The DeltaF508 protein appears to be trapped in a prefolded state with incomplete packing of the transmembrane (TM) segments, a defect that can be repaired by expression in the presence of correctors such as corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532. To determine whether the mechanism of correctors involves direct interactions with CFTR, our approach was to test whether correctors blocked disulfide cross-linking between cysteines introduced into the two halves of a Cys-less CFTR. Although replacement of the 18 endogenous cysteines of CFTR with Ser or Ala yields a Cys-less mutant that does not mature at 37 degrees C, we found that maturation could be restored if Val(510) was changed to Ala, Cys, Ser, Thr, Gly, Ala, or Asp. The V510D mutation also promoted maturation of DeltaF508 CFTR. The Cys-less/V510A mutant was used for subsequent cross-linking analysis as it yielded relatively high levels of mature protein that was functional in iodide efflux assays. We tested for cross-linking between cysteines introduced into TM6 and TM7 of Cys-less CFTR/V510A because cross-linking between TM6 and TM7 of P-glycoprotein, the sister protein of CFTR, was inhibited with the corrector VRT-325. Cys-less CFTR/V510A mutant containing cysteines at I340C(TM6) and S877C(TM7) could be cross-linked with a homobifunctional cross-linker. Correctors and the CFTR channel blocker benzbromarone, but not P-glycoprotein substrates, inhibited cross-linking of mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7). These results suggest that corrector molecules such as corr-4a interact directly with CFTR.",

Based on a prolonged bleeding time and absence of platelet aggregation in response to physiologic agonists, a 55-year-old white man was diagnosed as having Glanzmann thrombasthenia. The patient's platelet fibrinogen level was approximately 5% of normal. As judged by complex-dependent monoclonal antibody (MoAb) binding, surface expression of platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors was less than 5.5% of normal, whereas the binding of an anti-GPIIIa specific MoAb (7H2) was approximately 12% of normal. Immunoblot analysis of the patient's platelet lysates showed approximately 35% of normal levels of GPIIIa, approximately 30% of normal levels of GPIIb, and an abnormally migrating fragment of GPIIb. Biotinylation of the surface proteins on the patient's platelets followed by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis showed only GPIIb and GPIIIa subunits of normal size. Surface expression of platelet alphavbeta3 receptors was 192% of normal, suggesting that the patient's' defect was in GPIIb. Sequence analysis of the patient's GPIIb cDNA identified a T to C transition at nucleotide 643, predicting a Leu214Pro substitution. Direct sequencing of GPIIb exon 6 indicated that the patient is homozygous for the mutation. The nature of the Leu214Pro mutation was analyzed by expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. As judged by subunit-specific MoAb binding, surface expression of mutant receptors was approximately 60% of normal, but these receptors were not recognized by the complex-dependent monoclonal antibodies, 10E5 and 7E3. In addition, mutant receptors pretreated with the ligand-induced binding site MoAb AP5 were not recognized by the activation-dependent MoAb PAC-1 and mutant expressing CHO cells did not adhere to immobilized fibrinogen. These data suggest that the Leu214Pro mutation in GPIIb disrupts the structural conformation, and either directly or indirectly, the ligand binding properties of the heterodimeric complex. This is in accord with studies from other integrins that have implicated a beta-turn in a homologous region as important in ligand binding. Thus, the Leu214Pro mutation appears to produce the Glanzmann thrombasthenia phenotype by both qualitative and quantitative abnormalities. In addition, the mutation appears to confer susceptibility of the GPIIb subunit to proteolysis.",

Moreover, Rap1GAP, which stimulates the GTPase reaction of Rap1 10(5)-fold, does not have the classical \"arginine finger\" like RasGAP but presumably, introduces an asparagine residue into the active site. Here, we address the requirements of this unique reaction in detail by combining various biochemical methods, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, stopped-flow and time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The fluorescence spectroscopic assay monitors primarily protein-protein interaction steps, while FTIR resolves simultaneously the elementary steps of functional groups labor-free, but it is less sensitive and needs higher concentrations. Combining both methods allows us to distinguish weather mechanistic defects caused by mutation are due to affinity or due to functionality. We show that several mutations of Asn290 block catalysis. Some of the mutants, however, still form a complex with Rap1*GDP in the presence of BeF(x) but not AlF(x), supporting the notion that fluoride complexes are indicators of the ground versus transition state. Mutational analysis also shows that Thr61 is not required for catalysis. While replacement of Thr61 of Rap1 by Leu eliminates GTPase activation by Rap1GAP, the T61A and T61Q mutants have only a minor effect on catalysis, but change the relative rates of cleavage and (P(i)(-)) release. While Rap1GAP(N290A) is completely inactive on wild-type Rap1, it can act on Rap1(T61Q), arguing that Asn290 in trans has a role in catalysis similar to that of the intrinsic Gln in Ras and Rho. Finally, since FTIR works at high, and thus mostly saturating, concentrations, it can clearly separate effects on affinity from purely catalytic modifications, showing that Arg388, conserved between RapGAPs and mutated in the homologous RheBGAP Tuberin, affects binding affinity severely but has no effect on the cleavage reaction itself.",

Two serine residues in the kinase insert, Ser-741 and Ser-746, are PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites in vivo and account for all phosphorylation by PKC in vitro. Together they comprise more than 60% of the total SCF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation in living cells and 85-90% of its phosphorylation in resting cells. Two additional serine residues, Ser-821 close to the major tyrosine autophosphorylation site in the kinase domain and Ser-959 in the carboxyl terminus are SCF-stimulated PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites. However, they are not phosphorylated directly by PKC-alpha in vitro. Both specific receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation and specific receptor-associated phosphatidylinositide 3'-kinase activity was increased approximately 2-fold in response to SCF in PAE cells stably expressing Kit/SCFR(S741A/S746A). Furthermore, the kinase activity of Kit/SCFR(S741A/S746A) toward an exogenous substrate was increased, which was reflected as a decreased Km and an increased Vmax, in accordance with the negative regulatory role of PKC on Kit/SCFR signaling.",

Cleavage of Rb induced by TNF was blocked in vivo and in vitro by two specific inhibitors of ICE-like proteases, and in vitro by a point mutation (Asp886 to Ala) within the ICE-like protease cleavage site of Rb, (883)DEAD(886).

Transcriptome analysis following introduction of a constitutively active form of p53 (p53T18D/S20D) into colon carcinoma cell lines identified transcriptional activation of the carboxylesterase 2 (CES-2) gene, which is involved in drug metabolism. We examined whether p53 activated by the DNA-damaging drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) also induces CES-2 expression. Our experiments showed that 5-FU induced CES-2 expression in two colon carcinoma cell lines that express wild-type p53 (HCT116 p53(+/+) and RKO) but not in five lines that are p53-null (HCT116 p53(-/- )) or express mutated p53 (HT29, KM12C, KM12SM, and KM12L4A). Sequence analysis revealed a putative p53-binding element in the first intron of CES-2 that differed from consensus by one nucleotide. A reporter gene assay showed that the luciferase construct with the p53-binding element responded to 5-FU treatment, whereas the reporter construct without the binding element did not. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that p53 bound the CES-2 fragment containing the p53-binding element after 5-FU treatment, whereas p21 binding to p53 was present with or without chemotherapy. Knockdown of expression of CES-2 and p53 by small interference RNA in RKO and HCT116 p53(+/+) cells attenuated the anti-proliferation effects of CPT11. These results taken together show that activated p53 directly regulates CES-2 expression via a p53-binding site, representing a novel mechanism through which the p53 pathway modulates drug metabolism. In addition, the degree of homology in the p53-binding element may determine the strength of p53 regulation.",

We have extended these studies in vitro. We found that tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV) VPg is retained on glutathione-Sepharose matrices if co-incubated with a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NIb fusion protein, but not with GST, which is suggestive of a direct physical interaction between these two proteins. However, a mutation in the VPg (Y1860S) that eliminates virus infectivity and the interaction in yeast cells had little effect on the in vitro interaction. We also found that the TVMV VPg and NIa proteins are capable of stimulating the polymerase activity of the NIb protein. Since this stimulatory activity is retained when the proteinase domain of the NIa is removed, we conclude that the VPg is the moiety responsible for the stimulation of polymerase activity. As with the interaction revealed by co-purification, the Y1860S mutation had little or no effect on the stimulation of polymerase activity. Moreover, the VPg was able to stimulate a mutant NIb with an altered 'GDD' motif. Our studies thus provide two lines of evidence indicative of in vitro interactions between the TVMV VPg and NIb proteins.",

Therefore, increases in p53 levels are tightly regulated, mainly by its transcriptional target, mdm2, that downregulates p53. Elucidation of new signaling pathways requires the characterization of the members and the nature of their connection. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) contributes to p53 stabilization by partly interfering with its mdm2-mediated degradation, among other mechanisms; therefore, it is likely that some form of autoregulation between VRK1 and p53 must occur. We report here the identification of an autoregulatory loop between p53 and its stabilizing VRK1. There is an inverse correlation between VRK1 and p53 levels in cell lines, and induction of p53 by UV light downregulates VRK1 in fibroblasts. As the amount of p53 protein increases, there is a downregulation of the VRK1 protein level independent of its promoter. This effect is indirect but requires a transcriptionally active p53. The three most common transcriptionally inactive mutations detected in hereditary (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) and sporadic human cancer, p53(R175H), p53(R248W), and p53(R273H), as well as p53(R280K), are unable to induce downregulation of VRK1 protein. The p53 isoforms Delta40p53 and p53beta, lacking the transactivation and oligomerization domains, respectively, do not downregulate VRK1. VRK1 downregulation induced by p53 is independent of mdm2 activity and proteasome-mediated degradation since it occurs in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and in mdm2-deficient cells. The degradation of VRK1 is sensitive to chloroquine, an inhibitor of the late endosome-lysosome transport, and to serine protease inhibitors of the lysosomal pathway.",

We now identify another kinase, GSK-3\u03b2. siRNA-mediated knock-down of GSK-3\u03b2 increases NFAT5 transcriptional and transactivating activities without affecting high NaCl-induced nuclear localization of NFAT5 or NFAT5 protein expression. High NaCl increases phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2-S9, which inhibits GSK-3\u03b2. In GSK-3\u03b2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts transfection of GSK-3\u03b2, in which serine 9 is mutated to alanine, so that it cannot be inhibited by phosphorylation at that site, inhibits high NaCl-induced NFAT5 transcriptional activity more than transfection of wild-type GSK-3\u03b2. High NaCl-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2-S9 depends on PKA, PI3K, and AKT, but not p38\u03b1. Overexpression of PKA catalytic subunit \u03b1 or of catalytically active AKT1 reduces inhibition of NFAT5 by GSK-3\u03b2, but overexpression of p38\u03b1 together with its catalytically active upstream kinase, MKK6, does not.

METHODS: HEK 293 cells transfected with WT and/or mutant TNFRSF1A were used to investigate the interaction of anti-TNFRSF1A mAb with the WT and mutant proteins. Monoclonal antibodies that differentially bound to C33Y TNFRSF1A were used to investigate the distribution of WT and mutant TNFRSF1A in TRAPS patients with the C33Y mutation. RESULTS: We identified a mAb whose binding to TNFRSF1A was completely abolished by the C33Y or C52F TRAPS-associated mutations, whereas other mutations (T50M, C88Y, R92Q) had lesser effects on the binding of this mAb. A different mAb was found to bind efficiently to all of the mutant forms of TNFRSF1A examined as well as to the WT receptor. Exploitation of the differential binding properties of these mAb indicated that mutant (as distinct from WT) TNFRSF1A showed abnormal intracellular retention in the neutrophils of TRAPS patients with the C33Y mutation, with little if any expression of mutant TNFRSF1A on the cell surface or as soluble receptor in plasma. CONCLUSION: TRAPS-associated mutant TNFRSF1A has an antigenically altered structure and shows abnormal retention in the leukocytes of patients with TRAPS, which is consistent with previous findings from in vitro and transgenic model systems. This is consistent with a misfolded protein response contributing to the pathophysiology of TRAPS.",

Furthermore, as well as stimulating Ras/Map kinase signaling, soc-1/Gab1 stimulates a poorly defined signaling pathway that represses class 2 daf-2 phenotypes. In addition, it is shown that SOC-1 binds the C-terminal SH3 domain of SEM-5. This binding is likely to be functional as the sem-5(n2195)G201R mutation, which disrupts SOC-1 binding, behaves in a qualitatively similar manner to a soc-1 null allele in all assays for let-23/Egfr and daf-2/InsR signaling that were examined. Further genetic analysis suggests that ptp-2/Shp2 mediates the negative function of soc-1/Gab1 in PI3K-mediated signaling, as well as the positive function in Ras/Map kinase signaling. Other effectors of soc-1/Gab1 are likely to inhibit PLCgamma-mediated signaling and stimulate the poorly defined signaling pathway that represses class 2 daf-2 phenotypes.

Many reports have indicated that PKG might regulate cell function by activating members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of signaling proteins. In this study, stimulation of HEK-293 cells with nitric oxide (NO) was found to induce a rapid accumulation of phosphorylated p38 MAPK. The involvement of PKG in this process was confirmed by cotransfection of a dominant negative PKG construct (G1alphaR-GFP), which was able to block cGMP-induced p38 MAPK activation. Transfection of cells to express dominant negative Rac1(T17N) was also able to dose-dependently block cGMP-stimulated activation of p38 MAPK, thus indicating the importance of this pathway downstream of PKG. GST-PDB affinity-precipitation experiments revealed that stimulation of HEK293 cells with either nitric oxide or 8-Br-cGMP resulted in a rapid and transient activation of Rac1 with similar kinetics to p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Moreover, using in vitro kinase assays it was found that cGMP also stimulated the activity of the Rac1 effector Pak1. The activation of both Rac1 and Pak1 by 8-Br-cGMP was completely abolished by transfection of the cells with G1alphaR-GFP. Expression of the Rac1(T17N) mutant inhibited PKG-dependent activation of PAK1 indicating that Rac1 functions upstream of PAK1 in this pathway. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated clear colocalization of PKG and Rac1 in membrane ruffles and dynamic membrane regions supporting a functional interaction. However, in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that Rac1 is not a substrate for PKG suggesting an indirect activation mechanism. Taken together these data demonstrate a novel PKG-dependent pathway by which the Rac1/Pak1 pathway is activated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this pathway is central to the activation of p38 MAPK by PKG in these cells.",

Coimmunoprecipitation of p85 with epitope-tagged EPO receptors was observed initially in FDC-HER cells labeled metabolically with [32P]orthophosphate, and association of these factors was confirmed by Western analyses of receptor immunoprecipitates using p85 antiserum. Interestingly, this association occurred in the absence of ligand, and exposure of FDC-HER cells to EPO did not detectably affect levels of receptor-associated p85 or overall levels of p85 phosphorylation.

This synergy is dependent upon c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of a unique tyrosine on the EGFR, namely, tyrosine 845 (Y845). Phenylalanine substitution of Y845 (Y845F) was found to inhibit EGF-induced DNA synthesis without affecting the catalytic activity of the receptor or its ability to phosphorylate Shc or activate mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that synergism may occur through alternate signaling pathways mediated by phosphorylated Y845 (pY845). One such pathway involves the transcription factor Stat5b. Here we describe another pathway that involves cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CoxII). CoxII was identified as a specific binding partner of a pY845-containing peptide in a phage display screen. EGF-dependent binding of CoxII to the wild type but not to the mutant Y845F-EGFR was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This association also required the kinase activity of c-Src. Confocal microscopy, as well as biochemical fractionation, indicated that the EGFR translocates to the mitochondria after EGF stimulation, where it colocalizes with CoxII. Such translocation required the catalytic activity of the receptor but not phosphorylation of Y845. However, ectopic expression of the Y845F-EGFR prevented the EGF from protecting MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells from adriamycin-induced apoptosis, whereas two mutants of Stat5b, a dominant-interfering mutant (DNstat5b) and a tyrosine mutation at 699 (Y699F-Stat5b) did not. Taken together, these data suggest that, through the ability of EGFR to translocate to the mitochondria, the binding of proteins such as CoxII to pY845 on the EGFR may positively regulate survival pathways that contribute to oncogenesis.",

It was hypothesized that the hinge region contributed to the instability of rbovISG15. Within 24 h of dialysis, rbovISG15 formed complexes as detected by reducing and denaturing SDS-PAGE. However, chemical perturbations of cysteine prevented formation of rbovISG15 complexes over time.

Neither wild-type nor mutant rbovISG15 was able to interact with the ISG15 E1 initiating enzyme, UBE1L, in an in vitro pull-down assay. Ovine (ov) ISG15 has three additional amino acids within the hinge region that were hypothesized to increase stability and the degree of interaction with UBE1L because of increased separation of the ubiquitin-like domains. Over time in solution, rovISG15 the level of rovISG15 secondary structure was diminished, whereas the Cys80Ser rovISG15 structure did not change.

In the present study, we attempted to identify the site in EF-1delta associated with the hyperphosphorylation by the herpesvirus protein kinases. Our results are as follows: (i) not only in infected cells but also in uninfected cells, replacement of the serine residue at position 133 (Ser-133) of EF-1delta by alanine precluded the posttranslational processing of EF-1delta, which corresponds to the hyperphosphorylation. (ii) A purified chimeric protein consisting of maltose binding protein (MBP) fused to a domain of EF-1delta containing Ser-133 (MBP-EFWt) is specifically phosphorylated in in vitro kinase assays by purified recombinant UL13 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) expressed in the baculovirus system. In contrast, the level of phosphorylation by the recombinant UL13 of MBP-EFWt carrying an alanine replacement of Ser-133 (MBP-EFS133A) was greatly impaired. (iii) MBP-EFWt is also specifically phosphorylated in vitro by purified recombinant BGLF4 fused to GST expressed in the baculovirus system, and the level of phosphorylation of MBP-EFS133A by the recombinant BGLF4 was greatly reduced. (iv) The sequence flanking Ser-133 of EF-1delta completely matches the consensus phosphorylation site for a cellular protein kinase, cdc2, and in vitro kinase assays revealed that purified cdc2 phosphorylates Ser-133 of EF-1delta. (v) As observed with EF-1delta, the casein kinase II beta subunit (CKIIbeta) was specifically phosphorylated by UL13 in vitro, while the level of phosphorylation of CKIIbeta by UL13 was greatly diminished when a serine residue at position 209, which has been reported to be phosphorylated by cdc2, was replaced with alanine. These results indicate that the conserved protein kinases encoded by herpesviruses and a cellular protein kinase, cdc2, have the ability to target the same amino acid residues for phosphorylation. Our results raise the possibility that the viral protein kinases mimic cdc2 in infected cells.",

The NF1-GRD mutants also suppress the oncogenic Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Nakafuku, M., Nagamine, M., Ohtoshi, A., Tanaka, K., Toh-e, A., and Kaziro, Y. (1993) Proc.

In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mutant NF1-GRDs attenuated the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by Ras(G12V), but not by platelet-derived growth factor. In cell-free systems, purified recombinant NF1-GRD mutants showed an inhibitory effect on the association of Ras.guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with Raf at several times lower concentrations than the wild type. Furthermore, it was revealed that the binding affinity of the mutant NF1-GRDs toward Ras.GTP gamma S is approximately 5-10 times higher than the wild type. These results suggest that the mutant NF1-GRDs tightly bind to an oncogenic Ras in its GTP-bound active conformation and block the interaction between Ras and its effector, Raf.",

In this study, we report signaling events following 4-1BB receptor aggregation using an Ak-restricted costimulation-dependent T cell hybridoma, C8.A3. Aggregation of 4-1BB on the surface of C8.A3 cells induces TNFR-associated factor 2 recruitment, which in turn recruits and activates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1, leading to downstream activation of c-Jun N-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK). 4-1BB ligation also enhances anti-CD3-induced JNK/SAPK activation in primary T cells. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 in C8.A3 T cells interferes with activation of the SAPK cascade and with IL-2 secretion, consistent with a critical role for JNK/SAPK activation in 4-1BB-dependent IL-2 production. Given the ability of both CD28 and 4-1BB to induce JNK/SAPK activation, we asked whether hyperosmotic shock, another inducer of this cascade, could function to provide a costimulatory signal to T cells. Osmotic shock of resting primary T cells in conjunction with anti-CD3 treatment was found to costimulate IL-2 production by the T cells, consistent with a pivotal role for JNK/SAPK in T cell costimulation.",

The site of interaction on the p110alpha and beta isoforms of PI 3-kinase lies between amino acid residues 133 and 314. A point mutation in this region, K227E, blocks the GTP-dependent interaction of PI 3-kinase p110alpha with Ras in vitro and the ability of Ras to activate PI 3-kinase in intact cells. In addition, this mutation elevates the basal activity of PI 3-kinase in intact cells, suggesting a direct influence of the Ras binding site on the catalytic activity of PI 3-kinase. Using an in vitro reconstitution assay, it is shown that the interaction of Ras-GTP, but not Ras-GDP, with PI 3-kinase leads to an increase in its enzymatic activity. This stimulation is synergistic with the effect of tyrosine phosphopeptide binding to p85, particularly at suboptimal peptide concentrations. These data show that PI 3-kinase is regulated by a number of mechanisms, and that Ras contributes to the activation of this lipid kinase synergistically with tyrosine kinases.",

However, the molecular basis of its unique product specificity has remained elusive. Here, we present the structure of TbPRMT7 in complex with its cofactor product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution and identify a glutamate residue critical for its monomethylation behavior. TbPRMT7 comprises the conserved methyltransferase and \u03b2-barrel domains, an N-terminal extension, and a dimerization arm. The active site at the interface of the N-terminal extension, methyltransferase, and \u03b2-barrel domains is stabilized by the dimerization arm of the neighboring protomer, providing a structural basis for dimerization as a prerequisite for catalytic activity. Mutagenesis of active-site residues highlights the importance of Glu181, the second of the two invariant glutamate residues of the double E loop that coordinate the target arginine in substrate peptides/proteins and that increase its nucleophilicity. Strikingly, mutation of Glu181 to aspartate converts TbPRMT7 into a type I PRMT, producing asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a histone H4 peptide showed that the Glu181Asp mutant has markedly increased affinity for monomethylated peptide with respect to the WT, suggesting that the enlarged active site can favorably accommodate monomethylated peptide and provide sufficient space for ADMA formation. In conclusion, these findings yield valuable insights into the product specificity and the catalytic mechanism of protein arginine methyltransferases and have important implications for the rational (re)design of PRMTs.",

Affinities were increased up to 20-fold compared to the best wildtype sequences, while the selectivity against a similar SH3 domain [Grb2SH3(N)] was not only retained, but sometimes increased. Blot techniques with GST-fusion peptides and in solution precipitation assays with biotinylated high affinity Crk binding peptides (HACBPs) were subsequently used to analyse the binding of these sequences to a large panel of SH3 domain-containing fusion proteins. Only those proteins which contained the CrkSH3(1) or CRKLSH3(1) domains bound efficiently to the HACBPs. A GST-HACBP fusion protein precipitated Crk and CRKL proteins out of 35S-labelled and unlabelled cell lysates. Very little binding of other cellular proteins to HACBP was detectable, indicative of a great preference for Crk and CRKL when compared to the wide variety of other endogenous cellular proteins. Moreover, HACBP disrupted in vitro preexisting Crk-complexes with DOCK180 and the exchange factors SoS and C3G, which are known targets of Crk adapters, in a concentration dependent manner.

METHOD: ANK/MYBBP1a and SPHK1 interactions were identified using yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation. To determine the role of these interactions in catabolic events of articular chondrocytes, ank/ank and wild type (WT) mouse chondrocytes transfected with full-length or mutant ank expression vectors (EVs) or femoral heads were treated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) in the absence or presence of SPHK inhibitor. Catabolic marker mRNA levels were analyzed by real time PCR; proteoglycan loss using safranin O staining and MMP-13 immunostaining were determined in femoral head explants; NF-\u03baB activity was determined by transfecting chondrocytes with an NF-\u03baB-specific luciferase reporter and analyzing nuclear translocation of p65 by immunoblotting; MYBBP1a nuclear or cytoplasmic amounts were determined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: The ANK N-terminal region interacted with SPHK1, whereas a cytoplasmic C-terminal loop interacted with MYBBP1a. Lack of ANK/MYBBP1a and SPHK1 interactions in ank/ank chondrocytes resulted in increased MYBBP1a nuclear amounts and decreased SPHK1 activity, and consequently decreased NF-\u03baB activity, catabolic marker mRNA levels, proteoglycan loss, and MMP-13 immunostaining in IL-1\u03b2-treated articular chondrocytes or femoral heads. Transfection with full-length ank EV reduced nuclear MYBBP1a amounts and fully restored SPHK and NF-\u03baB activities in IL-1\u03b2-treated ank/ank chondrocytes, whereas transfection with P5L or F376del mutant ank reduced nuclear MYBBP1a or increased SPHK activity, respectively, and consequently either transfection only partially restored NF-\u03baB activity. CONCLUSION: ANK/MYBBP1a and SPHK1 interactions stimulate catabolic events in IL-1\u03b2-mediated cartilage degradation.",

BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), a member of the plant RLK family, forms receptor complexes with multiple RLK proteins including BRI1, FLS2, EFR and BIK1 to regulate responses to growth hormones or PAMPs. RLK activation and signal initiation involve protein complex formation and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation between BAK1 and its interacting partners. To gain new insight into how phosphorylation contributes to BAK1-mediated signaling specificity, we first mapped the phosphorylation patterns of BAK1 associated with different RLK partners (BRI1, FLS2, EFR and BIK1). Quantitative phospho-pattern profiling by label-free mass spectrometry revealed that differential phosphorylation patterns of RLK partners resulted from altered BAK1 phosphorylation status. More interestingly, the study of two BAK1 mutants (T450A and C408Y) both showing severe defect in immune defense yet normal growth phenotype suggested that varied phosphorylation patterns of RLK partners by BAK1 could be the molecular basis for selective regulation of multiple BAK1-dependent pathways. Taken together, this phospho-pattern profiling strategy allowed for explicit assessment of BAK1 kinase activity in different RLK complexes, which would facilitate elucidation of BAK1 diverse functions in plant development, defense, and adaptation. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: BAK1 is a functionally important co-receptor known to interact with different receptor-like kinases (RLKs) to coordinate plant development and immune defenses. Our study first mapped the phosphorylation patterns of BAK1 associated with four RLK partners (BRI1, FLS2, EFR and BIK1), and further revealed that differential phosphorylation patterns of multiple RLK partners resulted from altered BAK1 phosphorylation status. More interestingly, the study of two BAK1 mutants suggested that varied phosphorylation patterns of RLK partners by BAK1 could be the basis for selective regulation of signaling pathways.

Sequence analysis revealed novel cDNA clones, the protein products of which were designated tomoregulin (TR) and consisted of at least three isoforms which were distinguished by their cytoplasmic domains. The cytoplasmic domains in all isoforms were short and contained potential G-protein activating motifs. Precursors of TR (Pro-TR) are glycosylated transmembrane proteins. Two secreted soluble forms resulting from proteolytic cleavage were distinguished by the presence or absence of the EGF-like domain. The EGF-like domain of TR was highly conserved compared to EGF/NRG family growth factors with the exception of an arginine to histidine substitution at position 39 (Arg --> His 39). Soluble TR stimulated erbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation in MKN 28 gastric cancer cells, although it was weak compared to neuregulin-induced erbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation; this suggests that TR might be a ligand for erbB-4- or erbB-4-related receptor tyrosine kinase. TR may have important roles in normal development of middle to late stages of embryos and maintenance of adult central nervous system tissues as high expression of TR mRNAs was observed in these tissues. The modular features suggest multiple roles for TR; these include functioning as a ligand for erbB- receptor, a regulator of TGF-beta-related growth factor signaling by direct interaction through the follistatin modules, and a G-protein-coupled receptor.",

YopH is translocated into host mammalian cells via a type III protein secretion system. Translocation of YopH into human epithelial cells results in dephosphorylation of p130(Cas) and paxillin, disruption of focal adhesions, and inhibition of integrin-mediated bacterial phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal 129 amino acids of YopH comprise a bifunctional domain. This domain binds to the SycH chaperone in Yersinia to orchestrate translocation and to tyrosine-phosphorylated target proteins in host cells to mediate substrate recognition. We used random mutagenesis in combination with the yeast two-hybrid system to identify residues in the YopH N-terminal domain that are involved in substrate-binding activity. Four single codon changes (Q11R, V31G, A33D, and N34D) were identified that interfered with binding of the YopH N-terminal domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated p130(Cas) but not to SycH. These mutations did not impair YopH translocation into HeLa cells infected with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Introduction of the V31G substitution into catalytically inactive (substrate-trapping) forms of YopH interfered with the ability of these proteins to bind to p130(Cas) and to localize to focal adhesions in HeLa cells. In addition, the V31G substitution reduced the ability of catalytically active YopH to dephosphorylate target proteins in HeLa cells. These data indicate that the substrate- and SycH-binding activities of the YopH N-terminal domain can be separated and that the former activity is important for recognition and dephosphorylation of substrates by YopH in vivo.",

MDM2 mediates the ubiqutination of p53 in the capacity of an E3 ligase and targets p53 for rapid degradation by the proteasome. Stress signals which impinge on p53, leading to its activation, promote disruption of the p53-MDM2 complex, as in the case of ionizing radiation, or block MDM2 synthesis and thereby reduce cellular MDM2 levels, as in the case of UV radiation. It is therefore likely that MDM2, which is known to be modified by ubiquitination, SUMOylation and multi-site phosphorylation, may itself be a target for stress signalling (SUMO is small ubiquitin-related modifier-1). In the present study we show that, like p53, the MDM2 protein is a substrate for phosphorylation by the protein kinase CK2 (CK2) in vitro. CK2 phosphorylates a single major site, Ser(267), which lies within the central acidic domain of MDM2. Fractionation of cellular extracts revealed the presence of a single Ser(267) protein kinase which co-purified with CK2 on ion-exchange chromatography and, like CK2, was subject to inhibition by micromolar concentrations of the CK2-specific inhibitor 5,6-dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole. Radiolabelling of cells expressing tagged recombinant wild-type MDM2 or a S267A (Ser(267)-->Ala) mutant, followed by phosphopeptide analysis, confirmed that Ser(267) is a cellular target for phosphorylation. Ser(267) mutants are still able to direct the degradation of p53, but in a slightly reduced capacity. These data highlight a potential route by which one of several physiological modifications occurring within the central acidic domain of the MDM2 protein can occur.",

Interestingly, PTEN mutants rendered phosphorylation-incompetent at these two sites, T382A/T383A, and were found to have drastically reduced expression in cultured cells. The enhanced degradation of PTEN was most likely mediated by the proteosome-dependent pathway, we have evidence that PTEN was polyubiquitinated. More interestingly, the non-phosphorylated forms of PTEN displayed significantly greater binding affinity than the wild-type protein to a previously identified PTEN interacting partner, MAGI-2/ARIP1.

FPN mutants either have a normal iron export activity but have lost their ability to bind hepcidin, or are defective in their iron export function. The mutant protein has been suggested to act as a dominant negative over the wt (wild-type) protein by multimer formation. Using transiently transfected human epithelial cell lines expressing mouse FPN modified by the addition of a haemagglutinin or c-Myc epitope at the C-terminus, we show that the wtFPN is found at the plasma membrane and in Rab5-containing endosomes, as are the D157G and Q182H mutants. However, the delV162 mutant is mostly intracellular in HK2 cells (human kidney-2 cells) and partially addressed at the cell surface in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells). In both cell types, it is partially associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and with Rab5-positive vesicles. However, this mutant is complex-glycosylated like the wt protein. D157G and G323V mutants have a defective iron export capacity as judged by their inability to deplete the intracellular ferritin content, whereas Q182H and delV162 have normal iron export function and probably have lost their capacity to bind hepcidin. In co-transfection experiments, the delV162 mutant does not co-localize with the wtFPN, does not prevent its normal targeting to the plasma membrane and cannot be immunoprecipitated in the same complex, arguing against the formation of FPN hetero-oligomers.",

The human (h) PTH/PTHrP receptor is a membrane glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 85000 which contains four putative N-glycosylation sites. To elucidate the functional role of receptor glycosylation, if any, we studied hormone binding and signal transduction in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with hPTH/PTHrP receptor (HEK-293/C-21). These cells stably express 300000-400000 receptors per cell. Inhibition of N-glycosylation with an optimized concentration of tunicamycin yielded completely nonglycosylated hPTH/PTHrP receptor (approximately 60 kDa). This receptor form is fully functional; it maintains nanomolar binding affinity for PTH- and PTHrP-derived agonists and antagonists. PTH and PTHrP agonists stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation and increases in cytosolic calcium levels. In addition, the highly potent benzophenone (pBz2)-containing PTH-derived radioligand [Nle8,18,Lys13(epsilon-pBz2),L-2-Nal23,Tyr34 3-125I)]bPTH(1-34)NH2 can photoaffinity cross-link specifically to the nonglycosylated receptor.

Our findings indicate that glycosylation of the hPTH/PTHrP receptor is not essential for its effective expression on the plasma membrane or for the binding of ligands known to interact with the native receptor.

Rab31 and Rab32, expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins, did not bind [alpha-(32)P]GTP on nitrocellulose blots but did bind [(35)S]GTP[S] in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner. Binding of [(35)S]GTP[S] was optimal with 5 microm Mg(2+)(free) and was markedly inhibited by higher Mg(2+) concentrations in the case of GST-Rab31 but not GST-Rab32. Both proteins displayed low steady-state GTPase activities, which were not inhibited by mutations (Rab31(Q64L) and Rab32(Q85L)) that abolish the GTPase activities of most low-M(r) GTP-binding proteins.",

However, the structure of the PixD-PixE complex has not been determined. To improve our understanding of how PixD transmits its captured light signal to PixE, we used blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to characterize the molecular mass of a recombinant PixD-PixE complex purified from Escherichia coli and found it to be 342 kDa, suggesting that the complex contains 10 PixD and 4 PixE monomers. The stoichiometry of the complex was confirmed by Western blotting. Specifically, three intermediate states, PixD(10)-PixE(1), PixD(10)-PixE(2), and PixD(10)-PixE(3), were detected. The apparent dissociation constant for PixE and PixD is ~5 \u03bcM. A docking simulation was performed using a modeled PixE structure and the PixD(10) crystal structure. The docking simulation showed how the molecules in the PixD(10)-PixE(4) structure interact. To verify the accuracy of the docked model, a site-directed mutagenesis study was performed in which Arg80 of PixE, which appears to be capable of interacting electrostatically with Asp135 of PixD in the predicted structure, was shown to be critical for complex formation as mutation of PixE Arg80 to Asp or Ala prevented PixD-PixE complex formation. This study provides a structural basis for future investigations of the light signal transduction mechanism involving PixD and PixE.",

In the GTP-bound state, Ras can interact with its effectors, triggering various signaling cascades in the cell. In the GDP-bound state, Ras looses its ability to bind to known effectors. The interaction of the GTP-bound Ras (Ras(GTP)) with its effectors has been studied intensively. However, very little is known about the much weaker interaction between the GDP-bound Ras (Ras(GDP)) and Ras effectors. We investigated the factors underlying the nucleotide-dependent differences in Ras interactions with one of its effectors, Raf kinase. Using computational protein design, we generated mutants of the Ras-binding domain of Raf kinase (Raf) that stabilize the complex with Ras(GDP). Most of our designed mutations narrow the gap between the affinity of Raf for Ras(GTP) and Ras(GDP), producing the desired shift in binding specificity towards Ras(GDP). A combination of our best designed mutation, N71R, with another mutation, A85K, yielded a Raf mutant with a 100-fold improvement in affinity towards Ras(GDP). The Raf A85K and Raf N71R/A85K mutants were used to obtain the first high-resolution structures of Ras(GDP) bound to its effector. Surprisingly, these structures reveal that the loop on Ras previously termed the switch I region in the Ras(GDP).Raf mutant complex is found in a conformation similar to that of Ras(GTP) and not Ras(GDP). Moreover, the structures indicate an increased mobility of the switch I region. This greater flexibility compared to the same loop in Ras(GTP) is likely to explain the natural low affinity of Raf and other Ras effectors to Ras(GDP). Our findings demonstrate that an accurate balance between a rigid, high-affinity conformation and conformational flexibility is required to create an efficient and stringent molecular switch.",

Inhibition of PKC eta by specific pseudo substrate inhibitor or knockdown of PKC eta by specific shRNA disrupts the junctional distribution of occludin and ZO-1 and compromises the epithelial barrier function. Expression of dominant negative, PKC eta(K394R) disrupts the TJ and barrier function, whereas wild-type PKC eta and constitutively active PKC eta(A161E) enhance the TJ integrity. Inhibition and knockdown of PKC eta or expression of PKC eta(K394R) induce dephosphorylation of occludin on threonine residues, whereas active PKC eta elevates occludin phosphorylation. PKC eta directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of occludin and phosphorylates it on highly conserved T403 and T404. T403/404A mutations result in the loss of occludin's ability to localize at the TJs, whereas T403/404D mutations attenuates the PKC eta inhibitor-mediated redistribution of occludin from the intercellular junctions.

Although certain post-translational modifications of alpha-synuclein and its related proteins are implicated in the genesis of LBs, the specific molecular mechanisms that both regulate these processes and initiate subsequent inclusion body formation are not yet well understood. We demonstrate in our current study, however, that the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 localizes to the LBs in PD brain tissue and thereby enhances the formation of alpha-synuclein immunoreactive inclusions. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue from PD patients revealed that Pin1 localizes to 50-60% of the LBs that show an intense halo pattern resembling that of alpha-synuclein. By utilizing a cellular model of alpha-synuclein aggregation, we also demonstrate that, whereas Pin1 overexpression facilitates the formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions, dominant-negative Pin1 expression significantly suppresses this process. Consistent with these observations, Pin1 overexpression enhances the protein half-life and insolubility of alpha-synuclein. Finally, we show that Pin1 binds synphilin-1, an alpha-synuclein partner, via its Ser-211-Pro and Ser-215-Pro motifs, and enhances its interaction with alpha-synuclein, thus likely facilitating the formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions. These results indicate that Pin1-mediated prolyl-isomerization plays a pivotal role in a post-translational modification pathway for alpha-synuclein aggregation and in the resultant Lewy body formations in PD.",

We screened 18 diabetic probands with unelucidated maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We identified two rare nonsynonymous mutations in the PASK gene (p.L1051V and p.G1117E), each of which was found in a single MODY family. Wild type or mutant PASKs were expressed in HEK 293 cells. Kinase activity of the affinity-purified proteins was assayed as autophosphorylation at amino acid Thr307 or against an Ugp1p-derived peptide. Whereas the PASK p.G1117E mutant displayed a \u223c25% increase with respect to wild type PASK in the extent of autophosphorylation, and a \u223c2-fold increase in kinase activity toward exogenous substrates, the activity of the p.L1051V mutant was unchanged. Amino acid Gly1117 is located in an \u03b1 helical region opposing the active site of PASK and may elicit either: (a) a conformational change that increases catalytic efficiency or (b) a diminished inhibitory interaction with the PAS domain. Mouse islets were therefore infected with adenoviruses expressing wild type or mutant PASK and the regulation of insulin secretion was examined. PASK p.G1117E-infected islets displayed a 4-fold decrease in glucose-stimulated (16.7 versus 3 mM) insulin secretion, chiefly reflecting a 4.5-fold increase in insulin release at low glucose.

Phosphorylation by PKA leads to modulation of 14-3-3zeta dimerization and affect its interaction with partner proteins. Substitution of Ser58 to Ala completely abolished phosphorylation of 14-3-3zeta by PKA. A phospho-mimic mutant of 14-3-3zeta, Ser58 to Glu substitution, failed to form homodimers, showed reduced interaction with 14-3-3epsilon and p53, and could not enhance transcriptional activity of p53. Moreover, activation of PKA decreases and inhibition of PKA increases the dimerization of 14-3-3zeta and the functional interaction of 14-3-3zeta with p53.

The most common disease-causing protein folding mutation, DeltaF508-cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), is destroyed by ERAD to cause cystic fibrosis (CF). p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) physically interacts with gp78/autocrine motility factor receptor to couple ubiquitination, retrotranslocation, and proteasome degradation of misfolded proteins. We show here that p97/VCP and gp78 form complexes with CFTR during translocation from the ER for degradation by the cytosolic proteasome. Interference in the VCP-CFTR complex promoted accumulation of immature CFTR in the ER and partial rescue of functional chloride channels to the cell surface. Moreover, under these conditions, interleukin-8 (IL8), the expression of which is regulated by the proteasome, was reduced. Inhibition of the proteasome with bortezomib (PS-341/Velcade) also rescued CFTR, but with less efficiency, and suppressed NFkappaB-mediated IL8 activation. The inhibition of the major stress-inducible transcription factor CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein)/GADD153 together with bortezomib was most effective in repressing NFkappaB-mediated IL8 activation compared with interference of VCP, MLN-273 (proteasome inhibitor), or 4-phenylbutyrate (histone deacetylase inhibitor). Immunoprecipitation of DeltaF508-CFTR from primary CF bronchial epithelial cells confirmed the interaction with VCP and associated chaperones in CF. We conclude that VCP is an integral component of ERAD and cellular stress pathways induced by the unfolded protein response and may be central to the efficacy of CF drugs that target the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",

The growth-arrest phenotype and loss of viability do not require components of the mating pathway and are associated with lysis sensitivity that may be related to undermyristoylation of two protein phosphatases, Ppz1p and Ppz2p. Growth can be rescued at 30 degrees C by adding myristate or sorbitol to the medium or by removing inosine. Cells can be rescued at 37 degrees C by overexpressing nmt1-181p or Nmt1p or by adding myristate to the medium. Selection of high-copy suppressors of the myristate auxotrophy and lethality observed at 37 degrees C yielded only NMT1, whereas six unlinked suppressors of the myristoylation defect (SMD1-6) were obtained when the screen was conducted at 30 degrees C. The protein products of three SMD loci were identified: (i) cdc39-delta 1.7p, which transactivates NMT1; (ii) Fas1p, the beta subunit of the fatty acid synthetase complex, activates FAS2's promoter and increases myristoylation of Gpa1p; and (iii) Pho5p, the major secreted acid phosphatase produced by this yeast. PHO5 is normally induced when yeast are grown in phosphate-depleted medium. Removal of inorganic phosphate from the medium also rescues nmt1-181 cells at 30 degrees C. PHO5's mechanism of suppression of nmt1-181 appears to involve, at least in part, activation of FAS2 transcription and a resulting effect on FAS1 expression. There is an inverse relationship between cellular N-myristoyltransferase and secreted acid phosphatase activities.

To identify residues that are involved in Fn binding to alpha IIb beta 3, recombinantly expressed 3fn9--10 module pairs with alanine substitutions introduced into each of the 38 charged residues were individually assayed for the ability to inhibit Fn binding to purified alpha IIb beta 3. Substitutions at Fn residues Arg(1493) and Asp(1495) of the RGD sequence were found to have the greatest effect on alpha IIb beta 3 binding, as expected. However, Fn residues Arg(1369), Arg(1371), Arg(1379), Arg(1445), and Arg(1448) were needed for optimal interaction of the 3fn9--10 module pair with alpha IIb beta 3.

We have generated a constitutively activated murine PDGFbetaR containing a valine to alanine substitution at residue 536, located in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain. When this mutant receptor (PR-V536A) was expressed in Ba/F3 cells, it allowed the cells to survive and proliferate in the absence of IL-3 or PDGF, and tyrosine phosphorylation of PR-V536A was increased markedly compared with that of the wild-type PDGFbetaR in the absence of ligand and similar to that observed in ligand-activated PDGFbetaR. PR-V536A displayed increased tyrosine kinase activity in vitro toward an exogenous substrate, and the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor was required for the constitutive activation of the mutant. This valine to alanine substitution also activated a PDGFbetaR mutant unable to bind PDGF. Alanine substitutions at positions homologous to V536 of the murine PDGFbetaR also activated other members of the PDGF receptor subfamily. The amino acid sequence of this region revealed a strong similarity to WW domains present in other signal transduction proteins. Furthermore, GST fusion proteins containing the juxtamembrane region of the PDGFR specifically associated with peptides containing the WW domain consensus recognition sequence PPXY. The results suggest that the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain plays a role in the regulation of receptor activity and function, perhaps by participating in protein-protein interactions.",

In the first assay, human IGF1R fused to Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were cotransfected in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. The chimeric receptors were then partially purified by wheat germ lectin chromatography, and BRET measurements were performed in vitro. In the second assay, BRET measurements were performed on living HEK-293 cells cotransfected with IGF1R-Rluc and YFP-PTP1B-D181A. Ligand-induced conformational changes within the IGF1R and interaction of the IGF1R with PTP1B could be detected as an energy transfer between Rluc and YFP. Dose-response experiments with IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin demonstrated that the effects of these ligands on BRET correlate well with their known pharmacological properties toward the IGF1R. Inhibition of IGF1R autophosphorylation by the tyrphostin AG1024 (3-bromo-5-t-butyl-4-hydroxy-benzylidenemalonitrile) resulted in the inhibition of IGF1-induced BRET signal between the IGF1R and PTP1B. In addition, an anti-IGF1R antibody known to inhibit the biological effects of IGF-1 inhibited ligand-induced BRET signal within the IGF1R, as well as between IGF1R and PTP1B. This inhibition of BRET signal paralleled the inhibition of the ligand-induced autophosphorylation of the IGF1R by this antibody. In conclusion, these BRET-based assays permit 1) the rapid evaluation of the effects of agonists or inhibitory molecules on IGF1R activation and 2) the analysis of the regulation of IGF1R-PTP1B interaction in living cells.",

Biol. Chem. 277, 28010-28018). Herein we demonstrate that NGF induces co-association of IRAK with atypical protein kinase C iota (PKC) and that the iota PKC.IRAK complex is recruited to the p75 neurotrophin receptor. Recruitment of IRAK to the receptor was dependent upon the activity of the iota PKC. Moreover, transfection of kinase-dead iota PKC blocked both NGF- and IL-1-induced IRAK activation and the activity of NF-kappaB. Hence, iota PKC lies upstream of IRAK in the kappaB pathway. Examining the primary structure of IRAK, we identified three putative PKC phosphorylation sites; iota PKC selectively phosphorylated peptide 1 (RTAS) within the death domain domain at Thr66, which is highly conserved among all IRAK family members. Mutation of Thr66 to Ala impaired the autokinase activity of IRAK and reduced its association with iota PKC but not TRAF6, resulting in impaired NGF- as well as IL-1-induced NF-kappaB activation. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanism whereby IRAK regulates the kappaB pathway and reveal that IRAK is a substrate of iota PKC.",

Ca(2+) is released from stores in the lumen of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SER) to initiate formation of the Ca(2+) transient by activation of a class of Ca(2+) release channels referred to as ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and is pumped back into the SER lumen by Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) to terminate the Ca(2+) transient. Mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptor gene, RYR1, are associated with 2 skeletal muscle disorders, malignant hyperthermia (MH), and central core disease (CCD). The evaluation of proposed mechanisms by which RyR1 mutations cause MH and CCD is hindered by the lack of high-resolution structural information. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal 210 residues of RyR1 (RyR(NTD)) at 2.5 A. The RyR(NTD) structure is similar to that of the suppressor domain of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)Rsup), but lacks most of the long helix-turn-helix segment of the \"arm\" domain in IP(3)Rsup. The N-terminal beta-trefoil fold, found in both RyR and IP(3)R, is likely to play a critical role in regulatory mechanisms in this channel family. A disease-associated mutation \"hot spot\" loop was identified between strands 8 and 9 in a highly basic region of RyR1. Biophysical studies showed that 3 MH-associated mutations (C36R, R164C, and R178C) do not adversely affect the global stability or fold of RyR(NTD), supporting previously described mechanisms whereby mutations perturb protein-protein interactions.",

We sought to determine whether this pathway depends in part on activation of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase and whether the virus gains advantages from this pathway beyond that of entry into S. We show that polyomavirus infection activates the S- and G(2)-phase checkpoints in primary as well as established mouse cells. Infected cells undergo a prolonged S phase compared to uninfected serum-stimulated cells and show no evidence of a G(2)-->M transition before lytic death ensues. Infection is accompanied by increases in ATM activity in vitro and in the level of ATM-S1981-P in vivo. The incubation of infected cells with caffeine, a known ATM inhibitor, did not block entry into S but reduced the rate of viral compared to cellular DNA synthesis. Importantly, caffeine lowered the yields of viral DNA an average of 3- to 6-fold and those of infectious virus by as much as 10-fold. Virus yields were 10-fold lower in ATM (-/-) p53(-/-) than in ATM(+/+) p53(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, indicating a p53-independent role of ATM in productive infection. Replacement of the normal SMC1 (structural maintenance of chromosomes, or cohesin) protein, a critical ATM substrate in the DNA repair pathway, with its phosphorylation mutant SMC1(S957AS966A) also lowered virus yields by roughly 90%. We suggest that polyomavirus activates and utilizes a component(s) of an ATM pathway of DNA repair to prolong S phase and aid its own replication.",

All three receptors contain a conserved aspartate residue (D98) at the extracellular boundary of transmembrane domain II and a conserved arginine residue (R309) near the extracellular boundary of transmembrane domain VII. To evaluate the functional role of these residues, site-directed GRP-R mutants were expressed in fibroblasts and assayed for their ability to both bind agonist and catalyze exchange of guanine nucleotides. Alanine substitution at GRP-R position 98 or 309 reduced agonist binding affinity by 24- and 56-fold, respectively, compared to wild-type GRP-R. Single swap GRP-R mutations either resulted in no receptor expression in the membrane (D98R) or the protein was not able to bind agonist (R309D). In contrast, the double swap mutation (D98R/R309D) had high-affinity agonist binding, reduced from wild-type GRP-R by only 6-fold. In situ reconstitution of urea-extracted membranes expressing either wild-type or mutant (D98A or R309A) GRP-R with G(q) indicated that alanine substitution greatly reduced G protein catalytic exchange compared to wild-type GRP-R. The D98R/R309D GRP-R had both a higher intrinsic basal activity and a higher overall catalytic exchange activity compared to wild-type; however, the wild-type GRP-R produced a larger agonist-stimulated response relative to the double swap mutant. Taken together, these data show that GRP-R residues D98 and R309 are critical for efficient coupling of GRP-R to G(q). Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a salt bridge interaction between these two polar and oppositely charged amino acids that maintains the proper receptor conformation necessary to interact with G proteins.",

We hypothesize that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection triggers an interleukin-1 (IL-1) activation loop that underlies the pathogenesis of LCH. Langerhans cells (LCs) are antigen presenting cells in the skin. When LCs encounter exogenous antigens, they migrate from the epidermis into draining lymphoid tissues to initiate T-cell activity. It has been proposed that LC migration-related factors, including E-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase, and Notch ligand induce LCH activity. We found that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which binds IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, is expressed at a significantly higher level in LCH affecting multiple organ systems (MS-LCH) than in LCH affecting a single organ system (SS-LCH). IL-1 stimulates T helper 17 cells and their signature cytokine IL-17 had been a matter of controversy. We detected higher levels of IL-17A receptor expression in MS-LCH than in SS-LCH and proposed an IL-17 endocrine model that could settle the controversy. IL-1 is the first cytokine secreted in response to sensitizers and promotes LC migration from sentinel tissues. Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), downstream of the IL-1 receptor, has functions in both RAS signaling and inflammation, leading to human cell transformation. In 2010, an activating mutation in the B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma gene (BRAF) V600E was found in LCH. This BRAF mutation induces phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that may play an important role with MyD88 in LCH pathogenesis. However, phosphorylated ERK (pERK) is rapidly dephosphorylated by dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), and limited proliferation is predicted in BRAF mutant cells. MyD88 binds pERK via its D-domain, thereby preventing pERK-DUSP6 interaction and maintaining ERK in an active, phosphorylated state. We detected MCPyV-DNA in the peripheral blood cells of two out of three patients with LCH in high-risk organs but not in those of patients with LCH in non-high-risk organs (0/12; P\u2009=\u2009.029). MCPyV infection can trigger precursor LCH cells with BRAF mutation to produce IL-1; the IL-1 loop is amplified in all LCH subclasses. Our model indicates both BRAF mutation and IL-1 loop regulation as potential therapeutic targets.",

In a purified system, SPBP bound only the in vitro-phosphorylated form of the ERalpha AF1 or the phosphoserine mimic S118E, and the interaction domain could be mapped to a 42-amino-acid fragment of SPBP. In cells, SPBP preferentially interacted with liganded and phosphorylated ERalpha. Functionally, SPBP behaved as a repressor of activated ERalpha, which extends its previously demonstrated roles as a DNA binding transactivation factor and coactivator of other transcription factors. By targeting the phosphorylated form of AF1, SPBP may contribute to attenuating and fine-tuning ERalpha activity. A functional consequence is that SPBP inhibits the proliferation of ERalpha-dependent but not ERalpha-independent breast cancer cell lines, mirroring a reported negative correlation with the ERalpha status of breast tumors.",

Bcl-2 undergoes similar phosphorylation in COS-7 when coexpressed together with p54-SAPKbeta and the constitutive Rac1 mutant G12V. This is seen by both 32PO4 labeling and the appearance of five discrete Bcl-2 bands with reduced gel mobility. As anticipated, both intracellular p54-SAPKbeta activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation are blocked by co-transfection with the MAP kinase specific phosphatase MKP3/PYST1. MAP kinase specificity is also seen in COS-7 cells as Bcl-2 undergoes only weak phosphorylation when co-expressed with enzymatically activated ERK1 or p38. Four critical residues undergoing phosphorylation in COS-7 cells were identified by expression of the quadruple Bcl-2 point mutant T56A,S70A,T74A, S87A. Sequencing phosphopeptides derived from tryptic digests of Bcl-2 indicates that purified GST-p54-SAPKbeta phosphorylates identical sites in vitro.

Co-assembly of KCNQ1 with the auxiliary \u03b2-subunit KCNE1 strongly up-regulates this current. In cardiac myocytes, KCNQ1/E1 complexes are thought to give rise to the delayed rectifier current IKs, which contributes to cardiac action potential repolarization. We report here that the type I membrane protein BACE1 (\u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1), which is best known for its detrimental role in Alzheimer's disease, but is also, as reported here, present in cardiac myocytes, serves as a novel interaction partner of KCNQ1. Using HEK293T cells as heterologous expression system to study the electrophysiological effects of BACE1 and KCNE1 on KCNQ1 in different combinations, our main findings were the following: (1) BACE1 slowed the inactivation of KCNQ1 current producing an increased initial response to depolarizing voltage steps. (2) Activation kinetics of KCNQ1/E1 currents were significantly slowed in the presence of co-expressed BACE1. (3) BACE1 impaired reconstituted cardiac IKs when cardiac action potentials were used as voltage commands, but interestingly augmented the IKs of ATP-deprived cells, suggesting that the effect of BACE1 depends on the metabolic state of the cell. (4) The electrophysiological effects of BACE1 on KCNQ1 reported here were independent of its enzymatic activity, as they were preserved when the proteolytically inactive variant BACE1 D289N was co-transfected in lieu of BACE1 or when BACE1-expressing cells were treated with the BACE1-inhibiting compound C3. (5) Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) supported our hypothesis that BACE1 modifies the biophysical properties of IKs by physically interacting with KCNQ1 in a \u03b2-subunit-like fashion. Strongly underscoring the functional significance of this interaction, we detected BACE1 in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and murine cardiac tissue and observed decreased IKs in atrial cardiomyocytes of BACE1-deficient mice.",

Recent evidence suggests that cytohesin-2/ARNO acts downstream of small the GTPase R-Ras to promote spreading and migration. We hypothesized that cytohesin-2/ARNO could transmit R-Ras signals by regulating the recycling of R-Ras through ARF activation. We found that Eps15-homology domain 1 (EHD1), a protein that associates with the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), colocalizes with active R-Ras in transiently expressed HeLa cells. In addition, we show that EHD1-positive recycling endosomes are a novel compartment for cytohesin-2/ARNO. Knockdown or expression of GEF-inactive (E156K) cytohesin-2/ARNO causes R-Ras to accumulate on recycling endosomes containing EHD1 and inhibits cell spreading. E156K-ARNO also causes a reduction in focal adhesion size and number. Finally, we demonstrate that R-Ras/ARNO signaling is required for recycling of \u03b15-integrin and R-Ras to the plasma membrane. These data establish a role for cytohesin-2/ARNO as a regulator of R-Ras and integrin recycling and suggest that ARF-regulated trafficking of R-Ras is required for R-Ras-dependent effects on spreading and adhesion formation.",

The data found with mutations of acidic residues indicate that both conserved negative patches are essential for the binding of plastocyanin to the intact cytochrome bf complex. Replacing Ala-90 and Gly-10 at the flat hydrophobic surface of plastocyanin by larger residues slowed down and accelerated, respectively, the rate of electron transfer as compared with wild-type plastocyanin. These opposing effects reveal that the hydrophobic region around the electron transfer site at His-87 is divided up into two regions, of which only that with Ala-90 contributes to the attachment to the cytochrome bf complex. These binding sites of plastocyanin are substantially different from those interacting with photosystem I. It appears that each of the two binding regions of plastocyanin is split into halves, which are used in different combinations in the molecular recognition at the two membrane complexes.",

A Ser-230 to Ala mutation in the consensus sequence (SPIK) recognized by cdc2/CDC28-related kinase in PHO2 protein led to complete loss of its ability to activate the transcription of PHO5 gene. Further investigation showed that the Pro-231 to Ser mutation inactivated PHO2 protein as well, whereas the Ser-230 to Asp mutation did not affect PHO2 activity. Since the PHO2 Asp-230 mutant mimics Ser-230-phosphorylated PHO2, we postulate that only phosphorylated PHO2 protein could activate the transcription of PHO5 gene. Two hybrid assays showed that yeast CDC28 could interact with PHO2. CDC28 immunoprecipitate derived from the YPH499 strain grown under low phosphate conditions phosphorylated GST-PHO2 in vitro. A phosphate switch regulates the transcriptional activation activity of PHO2, and mutations of the (SPIK) site affect the transcriptional activation activity of PHO2 and the interaction between PHO2 and PHO4.

The enzyme crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 87.98 A, b = 69.41 A, c = 81.34 A, and beta = 106.07 degrees. Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis played an important role in the solution of the structure in that the cysteine mutants C86S, C114S, and C173S were used to help locate the positions of mercuric ion sites in nonisomorphous derivatives with ethylmercuric phosphate and to align the sequence with the model derived from MIR phases. A complete model for the protein was not obtained until part of the solvent structure was interpreted. The dimer in the asymmetric unit refined to a crystallographic R = 0.171 for 19,298 data and I > or = 1.5 sigma (I). The final model consists of 4150 atoms, including all non-hydrogen atoms of 434 amino acid residues, two GSH molecules, and oxygen atoms of 474 water molecules. The dimeric enzyme is globular in shape with dimensions of 53 x 62 x 56 A. Crystal contacts are primarily responsible for conformational differences between the two subunits which are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. The structure of the type 3 subunit can be divided into two domains separated by a short linker, a smaller alpha/beta domain (domain I, residues 1-82), and a larger alpha domain (domain II, residues 90-217). Domain I contains four beta-strands which form a central mixed beta-sheet and three alpha-helices which are arranged in a beta alpha beta alpha beta beta alpha motif. Domain II is composed of five alpha-helices. Domain I can be considered the glutathione binding domain, while domain II seems to be primarily responsible for xenobiotic substrate binding. The active site is located in a deep (19-A) cavity which is composed of three relatively mobile structural elements: the long loop (residues 33-42) of domain I, the alpha 4/alpha 5 helix-turn-helix segment, and the C-terminal tail. GSH is bound at the active site in an extended conformation at one end of the beta-sheet of domain I with its backbone facing the cavity and the sulfur pointing toward the subunit to which it is bound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

We first characterized and mapped the interaction of the FKBPs with the RyR3. GST-FKBP12 as well as GST-FKBP12.6 were able to bind approximately 30% of the solubilized RyR3. The interaction was completely abolished by FK506, strengthened by the addition of Mg(2+), and weakened in the absence of Ca(2+) but was not affected by the addition of cyclic ADP-ribose. By using proteolytic mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we pinpointed Val(2322), located in the central modulatory domain of the RyR3, as a critical residue for the interaction of RyR3 with FKBPs. Substitution of Val(2322) for leucine (as in IP(3)R1) or isoleucine (as in RyR2) decreased the binding efficiency and shifted the selectivity to FKBP12.6; substitution of Val(2322) for aspartate completely abolished the FKBP interaction. Importantly, the occurrence of the valylprolyl residue as alpha-helix breaker was an important determinant of FKBP binding. This secondary structure is conserved among the different RyR isoforms but not in the IP(3)R isoforms. A chimeric RyR3/IP(3)R1, containing the core of the FKBP12-binding site of IP(3)R1 in the RyR3 context, retained this secondary structure and was able to interact with FKBPs. In contrast, IP(3)Rs did not interact with the FKBP isoforms. This indicates that the primary sequence in combination with the local structural environment plays an important role in targeting the FKBPs to the intracellular Ca(2+)-release channels. Structural differences in the FKBP-binding site of RyRs and IP(3)Rs may contribute to the occurrence of a stable interaction between RyR isoforms and FKBPs and to the absence of such interaction with IP(3)Rs.",

After extensive washing to remove unspecifically bound proteins, the complexes are eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Transient complexes, which are characterized by high dissociation constants, are typically lost by this approach. In the present study, we describe a novel method for identifying transient protein-protein interactions using in vivo cross-linking and MS-based protein identification. Live cells are treated with formaldehyde, which rapidly permeates the cell membrane and generates protein-protein cross-links. Proteins cross-linked to a Myc-tagged protein of interest are copurified by immunoaffinity chromatography and subjected to a procedure which dissociates the cross-linked complexes. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins are identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Application of this method enabled the identification of numerous proteins that copurified with a constitutively active form of M-Ras (M-Ras(Q71L)). Among these, we identified the RasGAP-related protein IQGAP1 to be a novel interaction partner of M-Ras(Q71L).

Mutation of the Trk-A residue Tyr490 to phenylalanine prevents the association with Shc, while similar mutations at Tyr751 or Tyr785 are reported to prevent interaction of Trk-A with the p85 subunit of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase and phospholipase C-gamma 1, respectively. The strong and sustained activation of p42 and p44 mitogen-activated-protein kinases induced by PDGF-B/B in PC12/PT-R cells was unaffected by mutation of Tyr785 or Tyr751 to phenylalanine, but was smaller and transient after mutation of Tyr490, and almost abolished by the double mutation of Tyr490 and Tyr785. Mutation of Tyr490 reduced by 70% the PDGF-induced increase in inositol phospholipid 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies and greatly suppressed the PDGF-induced increase in the intracellular products of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase, while mutation of Tyr751 or Tyr785 had no effect. Mutation of Tyr785 (but not mutation of Tyr490 or Tyr751) abolished PDGF-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Mutation of Tyr490, alone or in combination with mutation of Tyr751 and Tyr785, had no effect on the PDGF-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K). However, the activation of p70S6K by PDGF (or nerve growth factor), but not the activation of mitogen-activated-protein kinase, was prevented by two structurally unrelated inhibitors of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase, wortmannin or LY294002. Our results demonstrate the following: (1) the phosphorylation of Tyr490 plays a major role in the activation of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase and formation of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids and confirm that the phosphorylation of Tyr 785 triggers the activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 in vivo. (2) Tyr490 phosphorylation (but not inositol phospholipid 3-kinase activation) is also required for strong and sustained activation of mitogen-activated-protein kinase and neuronal differentiation, while the smaller and more transient activation of mitogen-activated-protein kinase, produced by the activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 is insufficient to trigger the neuronal differentiation of PT-R cells. (3) Inositol phospholipid 3-kinase is required for the activation of p70S6K, but only a small increase in inositol phospholipid 3-kinase activity and the level of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids is required for maximal p70S6K activation.",

Here we show that BCR-ABL1 (nonmutated and T315I mutant) promoted RAD51 recombinase-mediated unfaithful homeologous recombination repair (HomeoRR) in a dosage-dependent manner. BCR-ABL1 SH3 domain interacts with RAD51 proline-rich regions, resulting in direct phosphorylation of RAD51 on Y315 (pY315). RAD51(pY315) facilitates dissociation from the complex with BCR-ABL1 kinase, migrates to the nucleus, and enhances formation of the nuclear foci indicative of recombination sites. HomeoRR and RAD51 nuclear foci were strongly reduced by RAD51(Y315F) phosphorylation-less mutant. In addition, peptide aptamer mimicking RAD51(pY315) fragment, but not that with Y315F phosphorylation-less substitution, diminished RAD51 foci formation and inhibited HomeoRR in leukemia cells. In conclusion, we postulate that BCR-ABL1 kinase-mediated RAD51(pY315) promotes unfaithful HomeoRR in leukemia cells, which may contribute to accumulation of secondary chromosomal aberrations responsible for CML relapse and progression.",

Mutation analysis identifies Thr374 as a major PKA site determining Gli1 protein localization. In the three-dimensional structure, Thr374 resides adjacent to the basic residue cluster of the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Phosphorylation of this Thr residue is predicted to alter the local charge and consequently the NLS function. Indeed, mutation of this residue to Asp (Gli1/T374D) results in more cytoplasmic Gli1 whereas a mutation to Lys (Gli1/T374K) leads to more nuclear Gli1. Disruption of the NLS causes Gli1/T374K to be more cytoplasmic. We find that the change of Gli1 localization is correlated with the change of its transcriptional activity. These data provide evidence to support a model that PKA regulates Gli1 localization and its transcriptional activity, in part, through modulating the NLS function.",

In this study, the AT1R antagonist losartan strengthened the interaction between AT1R and D1R and increased expression of D1R on the plasma membrane in vitro. In rat proximal tubule cells that express endogenous AT1R and D1R, losartan increased cAMP generation. Losartan increased cAMP in HEK 293a cells transfected with both AT1R and D1R, but it did not increase cAMP in cells transfected with either receptor alone, suggesting that losartan induces D1R activation. Furthermore, losartan did not increase cAMP in HEK 293a cells expressing AT1R and mutant S397/S398A D1R, which disrupts the physical interaction between AT1R and D1R. In vivo, administration of a D1R antagonist significantly attenuated the antihypertensive effect of losartan in rats with renal hypertension. Taken together, these data imply that losartan might exert its antihypertensive effect both by inhibiting AT1R signaling and by enhancing D1R signaling.",

Here we describe their binding site using computational modeling, binding, and functional studies on WT and mutated CCR5. The metal ion Zn(2+) is anchored to the chemokine receptor-conserved Glu-283(VII:06/7.39) Both chelators interact with aromatic residues in the transmembrane receptor domain. The additional pyridine ring of ZnTerp binds deeply in the major binding pocket and, in contrast to ZnBip, interacts directly with the Trp-248(VI:13/6.48) microswitch, contributing to its 8-fold higher potency. The impact of Trp-248 was further confirmed by ZnClTerp, a chloro-substituted version of ZnTerp that showed no inherent agonism but maintained positive allosteric modulation of CCL3 binding. Despite a similar overall binding mode of all three metal ion chelator complexes, the pyridine ring of ZnClTerp blocks the conformational switch of Trp-248 required for receptor activation, thereby explaining its lack of activity. Importantly, ZnClTerp becomes agonist to the same extent as ZnTerp upon Ala mutation of Ile-116(III:16/3.40), a residue that constrains the Trp-248 microswitch in its inactive conformation. Binding studies with (125)I-CCL3 revealed an allosteric interface between the chemokine and the small molecule binding site, including residues Tyr-37(I:07/1.39), Trp-86(II:20/2.60), and Phe-109(III:09/3.33) The small molecules and CCL3 approach this interface from opposite directions, with some residues being mutually exploited.

Cardiac and brain RYR peptides corresponding to the calmodulin binding sites present in the skeletal RYR [Menegazzi, P., et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 9078-9084] were synthesized, and their interaction with calmodulin was monitored by fluorescent techniques. The central portions of the skeletal, cardiac, and brain RYR protomers display one high (CaM1; Kd ranging between 2.7 and 10.2 nM) and one low affinity (CaM2; Kd ranging between 116 and 142 nM) calmodulin binding site. Depending on the RYR model having 4 or 12 transmembrane segments, a third calmodulin binding site (CaM3) was identified a few residues upstream from the putative transmembrane segment M1 or M5. Its affinity for calmodulin varied between the RYR isoforms: the cardiac RYR CaM3 displays a high affinity (9.09 +/- 1.0 nM, n = 5), while the skeletal and brain RYR CaM3 have low affinity, the lowest affinity being displayed by the brain isoform (234 +/- 39 nM, n = 3). The RYRs calmodulin binding site CaM1 encompasses the sequence Arg-His-Arg-Val(Ile)-Ser-Leu, which is phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of RYR PM1 peptides occurs on the Ser, corresponding to amino acid number 2919, 3020, and 3055 of the brain, cardiac, and skeletal RYR protomers, respectively. We found that phosphorylation of the RYR PM1 peptides was inhibited by calmodulin binding and that the formation of the PM1 peptide-calmodulin complex was inhibited by peptide phosphorylation. These data indicate that the effect of calmodulin binding to RYR CaM1 may be regulated by the phosphorylation state of the Ser residue localized within the sequence Arg-His-Arg-Val(Ile)-Ser-Leu.",

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is a potent stimulant of Akt kinase, leading to inhibition of the apoptotic pathway. In this study, we characterized the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by IGF-1 in PC12 cells and various neuronal cell types and examined the potential role of Akt in this regard. IGF-1 rapidly induced the phosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 in PC12 cells. The phosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 induced by 10 nm IGF-1 was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin (0.25-2 microm) and LY294002 (12.5-100 microm), but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 microm) or the p70 S6 kinase pathway inhibitor rapamycin (50 nm), suggesting that the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by IGF-1 is mediated by the PI3K pathway. As observed for IGF-1, an in vitro kinase assay with purified active Akt kinase demonstrated that the kinase is capable of directly phosphorylating FKHRL1 at Thr(32) and Ser(253), leading to inhibition of its pro-apoptotic properties. Moreover, transient expression of constitutively active Akt (MS-Akt, where MS is a myristylation signal) increased the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, whereas the expression of kinase-dead Akt (M179A Akt) attenuated the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by 10 nm IGF-1 in PC12 cells. Interestingly, FKHRL1 co-immunoprecipitated with Akt in PC12 cells, indicating that these two proteins can associate in these cells. As IGF-1 also induced the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in primary cortical and cerebellar neuronal cultures, these data, taken together, demonstrate that IGF-1, acting via the PI3K/Akt kinase pathway, can regulate the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, leading to inhibition of this apoptotic transcription factor in neuronal cells.",

In this study, mutant ErbB3 receptor proteins expressed in COS7 cells were used to investigate PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways activated by the ErbB2/ErbB3 co-receptor. We observed that a mutant ErbB3 protein with each of its six YXXM motifs containing a Tyr --> Phe substitution was unable to bind either the p85 regulatory or p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. However, restoration of a single YXXM motif was sufficient to mediate association with the PI 3-kinase holoenzyme, although at a lower level than wild-type ErbB3. When ErbB3 YXXM motifs were restored in pairs, evidence for cooperativity between two, those incorporating Tyr-1273 and Tyr-1286, was observed. Interestingly, we have shown that an apparent association of PI 3-kinase activity with ErbB2/Neu was due to the residual presence of ErbB3 in ErbB2 immunoprecipitates. The necessity of ErbB3 association with PI 3-kinase for downstream signaling to the effector kinase Akt was also investigated. Here, the heregulin-dependent translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation was observed in intact NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Recruitment of PI 3-kinase to ErbB3 was required for both activities, and it appeared that ErbB2 activation alone was not sufficient to activate PI 3-kinase signaling in these cells.",

The GP Ib-IX-binding site is only expressed following activation of vWF, a process that regulates vWF-mediated platelet adhesion. Binding of vWF to the GP Ib-IX complex involves the vWF A1 internal repeat domain, which also contains distinct binding sites for sulfatides, heparin, and the non-physiological modulators of the vWF-GP Ib-IX interaction, ristocetin and botrocetin. With the ultimate aim of further defining the mechanism of vWF modulation, we have analyzed the ability of various polyanionic compounds, including aurintricarboxylic acid, Evans blue, fucoidan, and a range of sulfated and phosphorylated sugars, to inhibit specific binding of purified vWF to immobilized sulfatides and heparin, and the ristocetin- and botrocetindependent binding of vWF to the platelet GP Ib-IX complex. Firstly, it was confirmed using a solid-phase binding assay that, like sulfatides, heparin specifically bound to a purified 39/WkiloDalton fragment of vWF (Leu-480 to Gly-718) that encompasses the A1 domain. Secondly, the ability of a number of polyanionic compounds to inhibit binding of vWF to heparin, but not to immobilized sulfatides, supported previous data suggesting that heparin and sulfatides bind to distinct sites on vWF. In addition, aurintricarboxylic acid, Evans blue and fucoidan all inhibited binding of vWF to both heparin and sulfatides with similar ICso values. Thirdly, many of the compounds tested that inhibited binding of vWF to heparin also effectively inhibited both ristocetin- and botrocetin-dependent binding of vWF to the GP Ib-IX complex on platelets, whereas none of the compounds tested blocked vWF binding to sulfatides and GP Ib-IX but not heparin. The majority of compounds tested inhibited the vWF-platelet interaction to a comparable degree in the presence of ristocetin or botrocetin, suggesting a similar mechanism for inhibition irrespective of the modulator used. These combined experiments provide evidence for an electrostatic model of vWF modulation, and suggest that the heparin-binding domain of vWF may be an important regulatory site involved in the adhesion of vWF to the platelet GP Ib-IX complex.",

We selected 38 novel mutations impairing PacC function, of which 21 missense mutations identify individual residues essential for zf-DBD structure/function. Our functional analysis agrees with our previous conclusion that finger 1 does not bind DNA and provides in vivo evidence that Trp80 and Trp116, located in the Cys knuckles of adjacent zinc fingers, are critical for zf-DBD structure/function. In the finger 3 alpha-helix, Gln155 (+4) is specifically involved in contacting DNA, while the major role of Lys159 (+6) resides in the nuclear localisation of the protein. In contrast, Lys158 is essential for DNA binding and for nuclear localisation. As finger 3 suffices to drive nuclear localisation of green fluorescent protein, we conclude that it contains an NLS including essential Lys158 and Lys159. These residues are within an alpha-helical basic sequence that is completely conserved amongst zinc fingers of the PacC/RIM101 family and present in an identical position of the last finger alpha-helix of Drosophila Cubitus interruptus, where it is also involved in nuclear localisation. We propose that PacC and Gli/Ci zf-DBDs belong to a subclass of these domains characterised by possession of a pair of conserved Trp residues involved in the interaction between the two most N-terminal fingers and the presence of an NLS in the alpha-helix of the most C-terminal finger. Loss of PacC nuclear localisation resulting from His142Leu (beta-strand) and Phe151Ser (hydrophobic core) substitutions in finger 3 suggests that its folding is required for NLS function. Overlap of DNA binding and NLS may aid release of PacC from its cognate importer(s) upon nuclear translocation, as suggested for zinc binuclear cluster proteins.",

Whereas Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors have been shown to activate Ras through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) called Ras-GRF1 (CDC25Mm) by binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to its N-terminal IQ domain, the mechanism of Ras activation through Gs-coupled receptors is not fully understood. We report the endogenous expression of Ras-GRF1 in HEK293 cells. Serotonin stimulation of HEK293 cells transiently expressing Gs-coupled 5-HT7 receptors induced protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the endogenous human Ras-GRF1 on Ser927 and of transfected mouse Ras-GRF1 on Ser916. Ras-GRF1 overexpression increased basal and serotonin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Mutations of Ser916 inhibiting (Ser916Ala) or mimicking (Ser916Asp/Glu) phosphorylation did not alter these effects. However, the deletion of amino acids 1-225, including the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding IQ domain, from Ras-GRF1 reduced both basal and serotonin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, serotonin treatment of HEK293 cells stably expressing 5-HT7 receptors increased [Ca2+]i, and the serotonin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was Ca2+-dependent.

In a search for the ligands of the SH3 domain of p130(cas) by far-Western screening, we cloned a novel protein named CIZ (for Cas-interacting zinc finger protein). CIZ consists of the following: a putative leucine zipper; a serine/threonine-rich region; a proline-rich sequence; five, six, or eight Kr\u00fcppel-type C(2)H(2) zinc fingers; and the glutamine-alanine repeat. CIZ binds Cas in cells and is located in the nucleus and at focal adhesions. We showed that CIZ is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, by using the transient interspecies heterokaryon formation assay. In order to search for the targets of CIZ in nucleus, we determined the DNA binding consensus of CIZ as (G/C)AAAAA(A) by cyclic amplification and selection of targets analysis. The consensus-like sequences are found in several promoters of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are the enzymes used to degrade the extracellular matrix proteins. CIZ binds to a consensus-like sequence in the MMP-1 (collagenase) promoter. Overexpression of CIZ upregulates the transcriptions from MMP-1, MMP-3 (stromelysin), and MMP-7 (matrilysin) promoters, and this transactivation was enhanced in the presence of Cas. Furthermore, the stable overexpression of CIZ promoted the production of MMP-7 in culture medium. In summary, CIZ, a novel zinc finger protein, binds Cas, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and regulates the expression of MMPs.",

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and growth and differentiation factor (GDF)-5 are two related transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 family members with important functions in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. BMP-2 is best known for its osteoinductive properties whereas GDF-5-as evident from its alternative name, cartilage derived morphogenetic protein 1-plays an important role in the formation of cartilage. In spite of these differences both factors signal by binding to the same subset of BMP receptors, raising the question how these different functionalities are generated. The largest difference in receptor binding is observed in the interaction with the type I receptor BMPR-IA. GDF-5, in contrast to BMP-2, shows preferential binding to the isoform BMPR-IB, which is abrogated by a single amino acid (A57R) substitution. The resulting variant, GDF-5 R57A, represents a \"BMP-2 mimic\" with respect to BMP receptor binding.\u00a0In this study we thus wanted to analyze whether the two growth factors can induce distinct signals via an identically composed receptor. RESULTS: Unexpectedly and dependent on the cellular context, GDF-5 R57A showed clear differences in its activity compared to BMP-2. In ATDC-5 cells, both ligands induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression with similar potency. But in C2C12 cells, the BMP-2 mimic GDF-5 R57A (and also wild-type GDF-5) clearly antagonized BMP-2-mediated ALP expression, despite signaling in both cell lines occurring solely via BMPR-IA. The BMP-2- antagonizing properties of GDF-5 and GDF-5 R57A could also be observed in vivo when implanting BMP-2 and either one of the two GDF-5 ligands simultaneously at heterotopic sites. CONCLUSIONS: Although comparison of the crystal structures of the GDF-5 R57A:BMPR-IAEC- and BMP-2:BMPR-IAEC complex revealed small ligand-specific differences, these cannot account for the different signaling characteristics because the complexes seem identical in both differently reacting cell lines. We thus predict an additional component, most likely a not yet identified GDF-5-specific co-receptor, which alters the output of the signaling complexes. Hence the presence or absence of this component then switches GDF-5's signaling capabilities to act either similar to BMP-2 or as a BMP-2 antagonist. These findings might shed new light on the role of GDF-5, e.g., in cartilage maintenance and/or limb development in that it might act as an inhibitor of signaling events initiated by other BMPs.",

Although several ARF-like proteins (ARLs) are known, their biological functions remain unclear. To characterize its molecular properties, we cloned mouse and human ARL4 (mARL4 and hARL4) cDNA. The appearance of mouse ARL4 mRNA during embryonic development coincided temporally with the sequential formation of somites and the establishment of brain compartmentation. Using ARL4-specific antibody for immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that endogenous mARL4 in cultured Sertoli and neuroblastoma cells was mainly concentrated in nuclei. When expressed in COS7 cells, ARL4-T34N mutant, predicted to exist with GDP bound, was concentrated in nucleoli. Yeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro protein-interaction assays showed that hARL4 interacted with importin-alpha through its C-terminal NLS region and that the interaction was not nucleotide-dependent. Like ARL2 and -3, recombinant hARL4 did not enhance cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. Its binding of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) was modified by phospholipid and detergent, and the N terminus of hARL4, like that of ARF, was myristoylated. Our findings suggest that ARL4, with its distinctive nuclear/nucleolar localization and pattern of developmental expression, may play a unique role(s) in neurogenesis and somitogenesis during embryonic development and in the early stages of spermatogenesis in adults.",

Expression of the constitutively inactive ARF6(T27N) mutant inhibits secretagogue-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells. Using a mutant of ARF6 specifically impaired for PLD1 stimulation, we find that ARF6 is functionally linked to phospholipase D (PLD)1 in the exocytotic machinery. Finally, we show that ARNO, ARF6, and PLD1 colocalize at sites of exocytosis, and we demonstrate direct interaction between ARF6 and PLD1 in stimulated cells. Together, these results provide the first direct evidence that ARF6 plays a role in calcium-regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells, and suggest that ARF6-stimulated PLD1 activation at the plasma membrane and consequent changes in membrane phospholipid composition are critical for formation of the exocytotic fusion pore.",

Crkl binds to BCR/ABL through its N-terminal SH3 domain and is known to interact with several signaling proteins that have been implicated in integrin signaling, including Cbl, Cas, Hef-1, and paxillin. We have previously shown that overexpression of Crkl enhances adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins through beta(1) integrins. In this study, the effects of Crkl on spontaneous and chemokine-directed migration of the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 were examined. Full-length, SH2-, and SH3(N)-domain deletion mutants of Crkl were expressed transiently as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein. Successfully transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The ability of these cells to migrate across a fibronectin-coated membrane, either spontaneously or in response to the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1alpha, was determined. Cells expressing green fluorescent protein alone were not distinguishable from untransfected or mock transfected Ba/F3 cells. However, Ba/F3 cells overexpressing full-length Crkl were found to have an increase in spontaneous migration of 2.8 +/- 0.6-fold in seven independent assays. The enhancement of migration required both the SH2 domain and the N-terminal SH3 domain. Migration in response to stromal-derived factor-1alpha was not significantly enhanced by overexpression of Crkl. Overexpression of Crkii also augmented spontaneous migration but to a lesser degree than did Crkl. Because the SH2 domain was required for enhanced migration, we looked for changes in phosphotyrosine containing proteins coprecipitating with Crkl, but not Crkl DeltaSH2, after integrin cross-linking. Full-length Crkl, but not CrklDeltaSH2, coprecipitated with a single major tyrosine phosphoprotein with an M(r) of approximately 120 kDa, identified as Cbl. The major Crkl SH3-binding protein in these cells was found to be the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G. Interestingly, overexpression of C3G also enhanced migration, suggesting that a Cbl-Crkl-C3G complex may be involved in migration signaling in Ba/F3 cells. These data suggest that Crkl is involved in signaling pathways that regulate migration, possibly through a complex with Cbl and C3G.",

The SBD possesses two binding sites with distinct affinities towards the soluble linear substrate maltoheptaose; dissociation constants (K(d)) of 17 and 0.95 microM were obtained for W563 K (binding site 2 mutant) and W590 K (binding site 1 mutant), respectively, compared to an apparent K(d) of 23 microM for the wild-type SBD. Further, the two sites are almost but not totally independent of each other for binding, since abolishing one site does not prevent the amylose chain binding to the other site. Using AFM, we show that the amylose chains undergo a conformational change to form loops upon binding to the SBD, using either the recombinant wild-type SBD or a catalytically inactive mutant of GA-I. This characteristic conformation of amylose is lost when one of the SBD binding sites is eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis, as seen with the mutants W563 K or W590 K. Therefore, although each binding site is capable of simple binding to a ligand, both sites must be functional in order to induce a gross conformational change of the amylose molecules. Taken together these data suggest that for the complex with soluble amylose, SBD binds to a single amylose chain, site 1 being responsible for the initial recognition of the chain and site 2 being involved in tighter binding, leading to the circularisation of the amylose chain observed by AFM. Binding of the SBD to the amylose chain results in a novel two-turn helical amylose complex structure. The binding of parallel amylosic chains to the SBD may provide a basis for understanding the role of the SBD in facilitating enzymatic degradation of crystalline starches by glucoamylase 1.",

Comparison with the wild-type enzyme showed that the betaTrp(170) side chain occludes the tunnel connecting the alpha- and beta-active sites, explaining the accumulation of the intermediate indole during a single enzyme turnover. To prevent a steric clash between betaLeu(169) and betaGly(135), located in the beta-sheet of the COMM (communication) domain (betaGly(102)-betaGly(189)), the latter reorganizes. The changed COMM domain conformation results in a loss of the hydrogen bonding networks between the alpha- and beta-active sites, explaining the poor activation of the alpha-reaction upon formation of the aminoacrylate complex at the beta-active site. The 100-fold reduced affinity for serine seems to result from a movement of betaAsp(305) away from the beta-active site so that it cannot interact with the hydroxyl group of a pyridoxal phosphate-bound serine. The proposed structural dissection of the effects of each single mutation in the betaA169L/betaC170W mutant would explain the very different kinetics of this mutant and betaC170F.",

Upon insulin stimulation we observe an association between the dnLMW-PTP and the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor. This association is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor since it is not observed in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, in vitro binding experiments between dnLMW-PTP and the insulin receptor reveal that the interaction is mediated by the LMW-PTP catalytic site, as indicated by competition with orthovanadate. DnLMW-PTP overexpression influences both the mitogenic and the metabolic bioeffects of insulin. In particular, in cells overexpressing dnLMW-PTP we observe an increase in the glycogenosynthesis rate and in mitosis as indicated by glucose incorporation into glycogen and thymidine incorporation into DNA, respectively. Moreover, we studied the insulin mediated signal transduction pathways starting from insulin receptor, such as the Src kinase, the p21Ras/ERK, and the PI3K routes. Our findings are consistent with a specific regulation of mitogenesis by LMW-PTP through a pathway involving c-Src kinase but independent by both PI3K and ERK.

Gp7 forms stable complexes with the SPP1 portal protein gp6. Deletion of the gp6 carboxyl-terminus and the mutation Y467-->C localized in the same region prevent gp6-gp7 complex formation. Gp7 binds double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. Gp6 competes for this interaction, and purified gp6-gp7 complexes do not bind DNA. Procapsid structures assembled in the absence of gp6 or carrying the mutant gp6 Y467-->C lack gp7. The gp6-gp7 interaction thus targets gp7 to the procapsid where the portal protein is localized asymmetrically at a single vertex of the icosahedral structure. The interaction between the two proteins is disrupted during viral assembly. Proteins homologous to gp6 and gp7 are coded by contiguous genes in a variety of phage genomes from Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that the gp6-gp7 complex is widespread in this group of phages.

The Vpx proteins of the SIVSMM/HIV-2 lineage of lentiviruses bind SAMHD1 and recruit an ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. RESULTS: Here, we have investigated the importance of nuclear localization for SAMHD1's antiviral function as well as its sensitivity to the Vpx protein of SIVMAC. Using GST pull down assays, as well as RNA silencing approaches, we show that SAMHD1 preferentially uses karyopherin \u03b12 (KPNA2) and a classical N-terminal nuclear localization signal (14KRPR17) to enter the nucleus. Reduction of karyopherin \u03b21 (KPNB1) or KPNA2 by RNAi also led to cytoplasmic re-distribution of SAMHD1. Using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), a cell type in which SAMHD1 is naturally expressed to high levels, we demonstrate that nuclear localization is not required for its antiviral activity. Cytoplasmic SAMHD1 still binds to VpxMAC, is efficiently polyubiquitinated, but is not degraded. We also find that VpxMAC-induced SAMHD1 degradation was partially reversed by ubiquitin carrying the K48R or K11R substitution mutations, suggesting involvement of K48 and K11 linkages in SAMHD1 polyubiquitination. Using ubiquitin K-R mutants also revealed differences in the ubiquitin linkages between wild type and cytoplasmic forms of SAMHD1, suggesting a potential association with the resistance of cytoplasmic SAMHD1 to VpxMAC induced degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Our work extends published observations on SAMHD1 nuclear localization to a natural cell type for HIV-1 infection, identifies KPNA2/KPNB1 as cellular proteins important for SAMHD1 nuclear import, and indicates that components of the nuclear proteasomal degradation machinery are required for SAMHD1 degradation.",

Therefore, significant efforts towards pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway. We previously reported that, in HIPK2 knockdown background, p53 undergoes misfolding with inhibition of DNA binding and transcriptional activities that correlate with increased chemoresistance, and that zinc rescues wild-type p53 activity. Zinc has a crucial role in the biology of p53, in that p53 binds to DNA through a structurally complex domain stabilized by zinc atom. In this study, we explored the role of zinc in p53 reactivation in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells. We found that zinc re-established chemosensitivity in breast cancer SKBR3 (expressing R175H mutation) and glioblastoma U373MG (expressing R273H mutation) cell lines. Biochemical studies showed that zinc partly induced the transition of mutant p53 protein (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb240 antibody for mutant conformation) into a functional conformation (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb1620 antibody for wild-type conformation). Zinc-mediated p53 reactivation also reduced the mtp53/p73 interaction restoring both wtp53 and p73 binding to target gene promoters by ChIP assay with in vivo induction of wtp53 target gene expression, which rendered mutant p53 cells more prone to drug killing in vitro. Finally, zinc administration in U373MG tumor xenografts increased drug-induced tumor regression in vivo, which correlated with increased wild-type p53 protein conformation. These results show that the use of zinc might restore drug sensitivity and inhibit tumor growth by reactivating mutant p53.",

The results show that PKCdeltaCF phosphorylates the p73beta transactivation and DNA-binding domains. One PKCdeltaCF-phosphorylation site has been mapped to Ser-289 in the p73beta DNA-binding domain. PKCdeltaCF-mediated phosphorylation of p73beta is associated with accumulation of p73beta and induction of p73beta-mediated transactivation.

However, the structural basis of ligand recognition by the alphaIIb propeller remains to be determined. In this study, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis of all residues located in the loops extending above blades 2 and 4 of the alphaIIb propeller, which are spatially close to, but distinct from, the loops that contain the binding site for an RGD ligand in the crystal structure of the alphaV propeller. Replacement by alanine of Q111, H112 or N114 in the loop within the blade 2 (the W2:2-3 loop in the propeller model) abolished binding of a ligand-mimetic antibody and fibrinogen to alphaIIbbeta3 induced by different types of integrin activation including activation of alphaIIbbeta3 by beta3 cytoplasmic mutation. CHO cells stably expressing recombinant alphaIibbeta3 bearing Q111A, H112A or N114A mutation did not exhibit alphaIibbeta3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen. According to the crystal structure of alphaVbeta3, the alphaV residue corresponding to alphaIIbN114 is exposed on the integrin surface and close to the RGD binding site. These results suggest that the Q111, H112 and N114 residues in the loop within blade 2 of the alphaIIb propeller are critical for ligand binding, possibly because of direct interaction with ligands or modulation of the RGD binding pocket.",

EGF activated NF-kappaB DNA binding, induced NF-kappaB reporter activity and the expression of antiapoptotic and cell-proliferative gene products. Interestingly, non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCC827 and H3255), which exhibit EGFR amplification, showed ligand-independent activation of NF-kappaB. Unlike tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), however, EGF failed to induce IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and ubiquitination and the activation of IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK). Although DN-IKKbeta inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB activity, DN-IKKbeta had no effect on EGF-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that EGF-induced NF-kappaB activation is IKK independent. Using dominant-negative plasmids, we also demonstrated the role of TRADD, TRAF2, NIK and Ras in EGF-induced NF-kappaB activation. By using specific antibodies and IkappaBalpha plasmid, which is mutated at tyrosine 42 to phenylalanine, we show that EGF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha at residue 42. Furthermore, EGF receptor kinase inhibitor blocked IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and consequent NF-kappaB activation. Overall, our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha at residue 42 is critical for EGF-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway.",

Tyr32His ras was primarily GDP-bound in quiescent Rat2 cells, although it rapidly associated with GTP after treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor.

A cross-linking study showed that the Asn(418) to Gln mutant (N418Q) of ErbB3 underwent autodimerization without its ligand, heregulin.

The N418Q mutant of ErbB3 was autodimerized with ErbB2 without ligand stimulation, and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt phosphorylation were promoted in the absence of heregulin. A cell proliferation assay and a soft agar colony formation assay showed that the N418Q mutant of ErbB3 coexpressed with ErbB2 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar in an ERK- and Akt-dependent manner.

The biophysical study of the interaction between a designed flexible tetraguanidinium-calix[4]arene and the tetramerization domain of protein p53 (p53TD) and its natural mutant p53TD-R337H shows how the floppy mutant domain interacts more tightly with the ligand than the well-packed wild-type protein. Moreover, the flexible calixarene ligand interacts with higher affinity to both wild-type and mutated protein domains than a conformationally rigid calixarene analog previously reported.

In addition, certain mutations and truncations of the integrin cytoplasmic tails are associated with a high-affinity/avidity receptor. To further evaluate the structural basis of integrin activation, stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants were screened for high-affinity/avidity variants of alphaIIbbeta3. One clone (AM-1) expressed constitutively active alphaIIbbeta3, as evidenced by (1) binding of soluble fibrinogen and PAC1, a ligand-mimetic antialphaIIbbeta3 antibody; and (2) fibrinogen-dependent cell aggregation. Sequence analysis and mutant expression in 293 cells proved that a single amino acid substitution in the cysteine-rich, extracellular portion of beta3(T562N) was responsible for receptor activation. In fact, T562N also activated alphaVbeta3, leading to spontaneous binding of soluble fibrinogen to 293 cells. In contrast, neither T562A nor T562Q activated alphaIIbbeta3, suggesting that acquisition of asparagine at residue 562 was the relevant variable. T562N also led to aberrant glycosylation of beta3, but this was not responsible for the receptor activation. The binding of soluble fibrinogen to alphaIIbbeta3(T562N) was not sufficient to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK), indicating that additional post-ligand binding events are required to activate this protein tyrosine kinase during integrin signaling. These studies have uncovered a novel gain-of-function mutation in a region of beta3 intermediate between the ligand-binding region and the cytoplasmic tail, and they suggest that this region is involved in integrin structural changes during inside-out signaling.",

However, the adaptor molecule that mediates this interaction remains to be identified. In this communication, we identify p52(Shc) as the mediator between tyrosine phosphorylation signaling and steroid signaling in steroid-responsive cell proliferation. Although the different LNCaP prostate cancer cells, C-33, C-51 and C-81, express similar levels of functional androgen receptor (AR), they exhibit different levels of androgen sensitivity. C-33 cell proliferation is highly responsive to the presence of androgens, whereas C-51 cell proliferation is comparatively less responsive to androgens. In contrast, C-81 cell proliferation is independent of androgens. In these cells, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of both p52(Shc) and ErbB-2 were greatest in C-81 cells, comparatively less in C-51 cells and weaker in C-33 cells. The levels and activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase, cellular prostatic acid phosphatase, decreased correspondingly in those cells. In both androgen-independent, rapidly growing C-81 and ErbB-2 cDNA-transfected C-33 cells, p52(Shc) was hyperphosphorylated at Tyr317 (Y317). Conversely, p52(Shc) tyrophosphorylation was decreased in prostatic acid phosphatase cDNA-transfected stable subclones of C-81 cells, which restore androgen-sensitive proliferation and leads to slow growth rates. In C-33 cells, androgen-stimulated cell proliferation correlated with tyrophosphorylation of ErbB-2 and increased phosphorylation of p52(Shc) at Y317, but not at Y239, differing from phosphorylation patterns associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant of p52(Shc), that is Y317F, blocks Y317 phosphorylation of endogenous p52(Shc) and abolishes androgen-stimulated proliferation, but not EGF-stimulated proliferation. Thus, Y317 of p52(Shc) serves as an important regulatory site that allows tyrosine phosphorylation pathways to moderate androgen sensitivity in human prostate cancer cells.",

The available evidence indicates that this interaction involves recognition of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT) by the matrix protein (MA) region of Pr55(Gag). Here we show that substitution of Asp for Leu at position 49 (L49D) in MA results in a specific reduction in particle-associated gp120 without affecting the levels of gp41. Mutant virions were markedly reduced in single-cycle infectivity despite a relatively modest defect in fusion with target cells. Studies with HIV-1 particles containing decreased levels of envelope proteins suggested that the L49D mutation also inhibits a postentry step in infection. Truncation of the gp41 tail, or pseudotyping by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, restored both the fusion and infectivity of L49D mutant virions to wild-type levels. Truncation of gp41 also resulted in equivalent levels of gp120 on particles with and without the MA mutation and enhanced the replication of the L49D mutant virus in T cells. The impaired fusion and infectivity of L49D mutant particles were also complemented by a single point mutation in the gp41 CT that disrupted the tyrosine-containing endocytic motif. Our results suggest that an altered interaction between the MA domain of Gag and the gp41 cytoplasmic tail leads to dissociation of gp120 from gp41 during HIV-1 particle assembly, thus resulting in impaired fusion and infectivity.",

We investigated the role of the scaffolding protein Gab1 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in this signal transduction cascade in cultured and native endothelial cells. Fluid shear stress elicited the phosphorylation and activation of Akt and eNOS as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SHP2. Overexpression of a Gab1 mutant lacking the pleckstrin homology domain abrogated the shear stress-induced phosphorylation of Akt but failed to affect the phosphorylation or activity of eNOS. The latter response, however, was sensitive to a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Mutation of Gab1 Tyr627 to phenylalanine (YF-Gab1) to prevent the binding of SHP2 completely prevented the shear stress-induced phosphorylation of eNOS, leaving the Akt response intact. A dominant-negative SHP2 mutant prevented the activation of PKA and phosphorylation of eNOS without affecting that of Akt. Moreover, shear stress elicited the formation of a signalosome complex including eNOS, Gab1, SHP2 and the catalytic subunit of PKA. In isolated murine carotid arteries, flow-induced vasodilatation was prevented by a PKA inhibitor as well as by overexpression of either the YF-Gab1 or the dominant-negative SHP2 mutant. Thus, the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS depends on Gab1 and SHP2, which, in turn, regulate the phosphorylation and activity of eNOS by a PKA-dependent but Akt-independent mechanism.",

The most common mutation results in a truncated receptor tyrosine kinase known as Delta EGFR that signals constitutively and promotes GBM growth. Here, we report that the 45-kDa variant of the protein tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP (TC45) can recognize Delta EGFR as a cellular substrate. TC45 dephosphorylated Delta EGFR in U87MG glioblastoma cells and inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling. In contrast, the substrate-trapping TC45-D182A mutant, which is capable of forming stable complexes with TC45 substrates, suppressed the activation of ERK2 but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. TC45 inhibited the proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of Delta EGFR cells but TC45-D182A only inhibited cellular proliferation. Notably, neither TC45 nor TC45-D182A inhibited the proliferation of U87MG cells that did not express Delta EGFR. Delta EGFR activity was necessary for the activation of ERK2, and pharmacological inhibition of ERK2 inhibited the proliferation of Delta EGFR-expressing U87MG cells. Expression of either TC45 or TC45-D182A also suppressed the growth of Delta EGFR-expressing U87MG cells in vivo and prolonged the survival of mice implanted intracerebrally with these tumor cells. These results indicate that TC45 can inhibit the Delta EGFR-mediated activation of ERK2 and suppress the tumorigenicity of Delta EGFR-expressing glioblastoma cells in vivo.",

It mediates the interaction between the water-soluble exohydrolase and its membrane-embedded glycolipid substrate at the lipid-water interface. Functional deficiencies in this protein result in a fatal neurological storage disorder, the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. In order to elucidate this cofactor's mode of action and identify the surface region of GM2AP responsible for binding to HexA, we designed several variant forms of this protein and evaluated the consequences of these mutations for lipid- and enzyme-binding properties using a variety of biophysical and functional studies. The point mutants D113K, M117V and E123K showed a drastically decreased capacity to stimulate HexA-catalysed GM2 degradation. However, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that the binding of these variants to immobilized lipid bilayers and their ability to solubilize lipids from anionic vesicles were the same as for the wild-type protein. In addition, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay system showed that these variants had the same capacity as wild-type GM2AP for intervesicular lipid transfer from donor to acceptor liposomes. The concentration-dependent effect of these variants on hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-sulfo-beta-D-glucopyranoside (MUGS) indicated a weakened association with the enzyme's alpha subunit. This identifies the protein region affected by these mutations, the single short alpha helix of GM2AP, as the major determinant for the interaction with the enzyme. These results further confirm that the function of GM2AP is not restricted to a biological detergent that simply disrupts the membrane structure or lifts the substrate out of the lipid plane. In contrast, our data argue in favour of the critical importance of distinct activator-hexosaminidase interactions for GM2 degradation, and corroborate the view that the activator/lipid complex represents the true substrate for the degrading enzyme.",

RESULTS: H2S could directly activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and that a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of VEGFR2 inhibited H2S-induced migration of human vascular endothelial cells. H2S promoted angiogenesis in Matrigel plug assay in mice and this effect was attenuated by a VEGF receptor inhibitor. Using tandem mass spectrometry (MS), we identified a new disulfide complex located between Cys1045 and Cys1024 within VEGFR2 that was labile to H2S-mediated modification. Kinase activity of the mutant VEGFR2 (C1045A) devoid of the Cys1045-Cys1024 disulfide bond was significantly higher than wild-type VEGFR2. Transfection with vectors expressing VEGFR2 (C1045A) caused a significant increase in cell migration, while the migration-promoting effect of H2S disappeared in the cells transfected with VEGFR2 (C1045A). Therefore, the Cys1045-Cys1024 disulfide bond serves as an intrinsic inhibitory motif and functions as a molecular switch for H2S. The formation of the Cys1045-Cys1024 disulfide bond disrupted the integrity of the active conformation of VEGFR2. Breaking the Cys1045-Cys1024 disulfide bond recovered the active conformation of VEGFR2. This motif was prone to a nucleophilic attack by H2S via an interaction of their frontier molecular orbitals. siRNA-mediated knockdown of cystathionine \u03b3-lyase attenuated migration of vascular endothelial cells induced by VEGF or moderate hypoxia. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: The study provides the first piece of evidence of a molecular switch in H2S-targeting receptor protein kinase in H2S-induced angiogenesis and that may be applicable to additional kinases containing functionally important disulfide bonds in mediating various H2S actions.",

The ability of FAK to mediate integrin signaling in the regulation of cell cycle progression depends on the phosphorylation of Tyr397, which implies a functional significance for the formation of FAK signaling complexes with Src, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Grb7. We have previously described a FAK mutant, D395A, that selectively disrupts FAK binding to PI3K, but allows FAK association with Src. Using this mutation in a mislocalized FAK mutant background, we show here that formation of a FAK/PI3K complex is not sufficient for cell cycle progression but the formation of a FAK/Src complex plays an essential role. We also show that mutation of D395 to A disrupted FAK association with Grb7. This suggests that a FAK/Grb7 complex is not involved in the cell cycle regulation either, which is supported by direct analysis of cells expressing a dominant negative Grb7 construct. Finally, we provide evidence that the Src-dependent association of FAK with Grb2 and p130(Cas) are both required for the regulation of cell cycle progression by FAK. Together, these studies identify important FAK downstream signaling pathways in cell cycle regulation.",

Although the in vitro properties of the two proteins are similar, differences between the phenotypes of the null allele mutants suggest that they play different roles in vivo. Through the isolation of a novel RAD51 allele encoding a protein with reduced affinity for DNA, we provide evidence that Rad54 and Rdh54 have different in vivo interactions with Rad51. The mutant Rad51 forms a complex on duplex DNA that is more susceptible to dissociation by Rdh54. This Rad51 variant distinguishes the in vivo functions of Rad54 and Rdh54, leading to the conclusion that two translocases remove Rad51 from different substrates in vivo.

A plasmid containing the sequence to express the tandem protein TF-tGFP was mutated to include an arginine-substitution at Lys255 within TF. MDA-MB-231 cell line, and HCAEC endothelial cells were transfected and subsequently activated with PAR2-agonist peptide. The wild-type and mutant TF-tGFP were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and the ubiquitination and phosphorylation state of TF examined. Analysis of the proteins showed that arginine-substitution of Lys255 within TF prevented its ubiquitination while the wild-type TF-tGFP was oligoubiquitinated. The TF-associated oligoubiquitin chain was estimated to contain up to 4 ubiquitin units, with the linkage formed between Lys63 of one ubiquitin unit, and the C-terminus of the next unit. The Lys255\u2192Arg substitution of TF-tGFP prolonged the phosphorylation of Ser253 within TF, compared to the wild-type TF-tGFP, lengthened the presence of TF-tGFP at the cell surface and extended the duration of TF-tGFP release from cells following PAR2 activation. A biotinylated 19-mer peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of TF (TFc) was used as substrate to show that the ubiquitination of TF was mediated by the Ube2D family of E2-enzymes and involved Mdm2. Moreover, double-phosphorylation of TFc was prerequisite for ubiquitination, with subsequent dephosphorylation of Ser253 by phosphatase PP2A. In conclusion, oligoubiquitination of Lys255 within TF permits PP2A to bind and dephosphorylate Ser253 and occurs to terminate TF release and contain its activity.",

In a previous interactomics study, aimed to gain further insight into nuclear PPIns functions, we identified ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1) as a potential nuclear PPIn-binding protein in a lipid pull-down screen. EBP1 is a ubiquitous and conserved protein, located in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, and associated with cell proliferation and survival. In the present study, we show that EBP1 binds directly to several PPIns via two distinct PPIn-binding sites consisting of clusters of lysine residues and positioned at the N- and C-termini of the protein. Using interaction mutants, we show that the C-terminal PPIn-binding motif contributes the most to the localization of EBP1\u00a0in the nucleolus. Importantly, a K372N point mutation, located within the C-terminal motif and found in endometrial tumours, is sufficient to alter the nucleolar targeting of EBP1. Our study reveals also the presence of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit p110\u03b2 and its product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 together with EBP1\u00a0in the nucleolus. Using NMR, we further demonstrate an association between EBP1 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 via both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, these results show that EBP1 interacts directly with PPIns and associate with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the nucleolus.

To investigate the effects of targeting ras GAP to the plasma membrane, ras C-terminal motifs sufficient for plasma membrane localization of p21ras were cloned onto the C terminus of ras GAP. Plasma membrane-targeted ras GAP is growth inhibitory to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and COS cells. This growth inhibition correlates with GAP catalytic activity, since the plasma membrane-targeted C-terminal catalytic domain or the GAP-related domain of neurofibromin is inhibitory, whereas the similarly targeted N-terminal domain is not. Moreover, the inhibition is abrogated by the inactivating mutation L902I, which abolishes ras GAP catalytic activity. Coexpression of oncogenic mutant ras rescues cell viability, but the majority of rescued colonies are phenotypically untransformed. Furthermore, in focus assays, targeted ras GAP suppresses transformation by oncogenic mutant ras, and in reversion assays, targeted ras GAP can revert cells transformed by oncogenic mutant ras. Neither the targeted or nontargeted N-terminal domain nor the L902I mutant of ras GAP has any transforming activity. These data demonstrate that ras GAP can function as a negative regulator of ras and that plasma membrane localization potentiates this activity. However, if ras GAP is involved in the effector functions of p21ras, it can only be part of the effector complex for cell transformation.",

To test the functional significance of these distinct interactions on platelet function in vivo, we generated knock-in mice expressing talin1 mutants with impaired capacity to interact with the \u03b23 integrin MPR (L325R) or NPLY sequence (W359A). Both talin1(L325R) and talin1(W359A) mice were protected from experimental thrombosis. Talin1(L325R) mice, but not talin(W359A) mice, exhibited a severe bleeding phenotype. Activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was completely blocked in talin1(L325R) platelets, whereas activation was reduced by approximately 50% in talin1(W359A) platelets. Quantitative biochemical measurements detected talin1(W359A) binding to \u03b23 integrin, albeit with a 2.9-fold lower affinity than wild-type talin1. The rate of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation was slower in talin1(W359A) platelets, which consequently delayed aggregation under static conditions and reduced thrombus formation under physiological flow conditions.

This problem is particularly challenging for ankyrin repeat proteins (ARs), which consist of linear arrays of small repeating units and play critical roles in almost every life process via protein-protein interactions, because the residues involved are discontinuously dispersed in both the ARs and their partners. Our previous studies showed that while both specific CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4A (P16) and gankyrin bind to cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in similar fashion, only P16 inhibits the kinase activity of CDK4. While this could explain why P16 is a tumor suppressor and gankyrin is oncogenic, the structural basis of these contrasting properties was unknown. Here we show that a double mutant of gankyrin, L62H/I79D, inhibits the kinase activity of CDK4, similar to P16, and such CDK4-inhibtory activity is associated with the I79D but not L62H mutation. In addition, mutations at I79 and L62 bring about a moderate decrease in the stability of gankyrin. Further structural and biophysical analyses suggest that the substitution of Ile79 with Asp leads to local conformational changes in loops I-III of gankyrin. Taken together, our results allow the dissection of the \"protein-protein binding\" and \"CDK4 inhibition\" functions of P16, show that the difference between tumor suppressing and oncogenic functions of P16 and gankyrin, respectively, mainly resides in a single residue, and provide structural insight to the contrasting biological functions of the two AR proteins.",

In this report, we describe the clinical case and molecular basis of HVDRR in an Asian boy exhibiting the typical clinical features of the disease including alopecia. Using cultured dermal fibroblasts from the patient, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) resistance was demonstrated by a shift in the dose response required for 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) mRNA induction. Western blot showed that the cells express a normal size VDR but contained reduced levels of receptor compared to normal cells. At 24 degrees C, the affinity of the patient's VDR for [(3)H]1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was 50-fold lower than the VDR in normal fibroblasts. Sequence analysis identified a unique T to G missense mutation in exon 6 that changed phenylalanine to cysteine at amino acid 251 (F251C). The recreated F251C mutant VDR showed reduced transactivation activity using a 24-hydroxylase promoter-luciferase reporter. Maximal transactivation activity exhibited by the WT VDR was not achieved by the mutant VDR even when the cells were treated with up to 10(-6) M 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). However, the transactivation activity was partially rescued by addition of RXRalpha. In the yeast two-hybrid system and GST-pull-down assays, high concentrations of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) were needed to promote F251C mutant VDR binding to RXRalpha, indicating defective heterodimerization. In conclusion, a novel mutation was identified in the VDR LBD that reduces VDR abundance and its affinity for 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and interferes with RXRalpha heterodimerization resulting in the syndrome of HVDRR.",

The \u03b11 subunit harboring the D219N mutation of GABAA receptors was reported to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic inefficiently to the plasma membrane, leading to a loss of function of \u03b11(D219N) subunits and thus idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). We present the use of small molecule proteostasis regulators to enhance the forward trafficking of \u03b11(D219N) subunits to restore their function. We showed that treatment with verapamil (4 \u03bcM, 24 h), an L-type calcium channel blocker, substantially increases the \u03b11(D219N) subunit cell surface level in both HEK293 cells and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and remarkably restores the GABA-induced maximal chloride current in HEK293 cells expressing \u03b11(D219N)\u03b22\u03b32 receptors to a level that is comparable to wild type receptors. Our drug mechanism study revealed that verapamil treatment promotes the ER to Golgi trafficking of the \u03b11(D219N) subunits post-translationally. To achieve that, verapamil treatment enhances the interaction between the \u03b11(D219N) subunit and \u03b22 subunit and prevents the aggregation of the mutant protein by shifting the protein from the detergent-insoluble fractions to detergent-soluble fractions. By combining (35)S pulse-chase labeling and MG-132 inhibition experiments, we demonstrated that verapamil treatment does not inhibit the ER-associated degradation of the \u03b11(D219N) subunit. In addition, its effect does not involve a dynamin-1 dependent endocytosis. To gain further mechanistic insight, we showed that verapamil increases the interaction between the mutant protein and calnexin and calreticulin, two major lectin chaperones in the ER. Moreover, calnexin binding promotes the forward trafficking of the mutant subunit. Taken together, our data indicate that verapamil treatment enhances the calnexin-assisted forward trafficking and subunit assembly, which leads to substantially enhanced functional surface expression of the mutant receptors. Since verapamil is an FDA-approved drug that crosses blood-brain barrier and has been used as an additional medication for some epilepsies, our findings suggest that verapamil holds great promise to be developed to ameliorate IGE resulting from \u03b11(D219N) subunit trafficking deficiency.",

In the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) this core is preceded by a myristylation motif followed by a long helix with Trp 30 at the end of this A-helix filling a hydrophobic cavity between the two lobes of the core. To understand the importance of the A-helix, the myristylation motif (delta 1-14) as well as the entire N-terminal segment (delta 1 -39) were deleted. In addition, Trp 30 was replaced with both Tyr and Ala. All proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. rC(delta 1-14), rC(W30Y), and rC(W30A) all had reduced thermostability, but were catalytically indistinguishable from wild-type C. Based on Surface Plasmon Resonance, all three also formed stable holoenzyme complexes with the RI-subunit, although the appKds were reduced by more than 10-fold due to decrease in the association rate. Surprisingly, however, the holoenzymes were even more thermostable than wild-type holoenzyme. To obtain active enzyme, it was necessary to purify rC(delta 1-39) as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST-rC(delta 1-39), although its thermostability (Tm) was decreased by 12.5 degrees C, was catalytically similar to wild-type C and was inhibited by both the type I and II R-subunits and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI). The Tm for holoenzyme II formed with GST-rC(delta 1-39) was 16.5 degrees C greater than the Tm for free GST-rC(delta 1-39), and the Ka(cAMP) was increased nearly 10-fold. These mutants point out striking and unanticipated differences in how the RI and RII subunits associate with the C-subunit to form a stable holoenzyme and indicate, furthermore, that this N-terminal segment, far from the active site cleft, influences those interactions. The importance of the A-helix and Trp 30 for stability correlates with its location at the cleft interface where it orients the C-helix in the small lobe and the activation loop in the large so that these subdomains are aligned in a way that allows for correct configuration of residues at the active site. This extensive network of contacts that links the A-helix directly to the active site in cAPK is compared to other kinases whose crystal structures have been solved.",

Cells have evolved a complex protein network to detect, signal, and repair DSBs. In mammalian cells, a key component in this network is H2AX, which becomes rapidly phosphorylated at Ser(139) (\u03b3-H2AX) at DSBs. Here we show that monoubiquitination of H2AX mediated by the RNF2-BMI1 complex is critical for the efficient formation of \u03b3-H2AX and functions as a proximal regulator in DDR (DNA damage response). RNF2-BMI1 interacts with H2AX in a DNA damage-dependent manner and is required for monoubiquitination of H2AX at Lys(119)/Lys(120). As a functional consequence, we show that the H2AX K120R mutant abolishes H2AX monoubiquitination, impairs the recruitment of p-ATM (Ser(1981)) to DSBs, and thereby reduces the formation of \u03b3-H2AX and the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA damage sites. These data suggest that monoubiquitination of H2AX plays a critical role in initiating DNA damage signaling. Consistent with these observations, impairment of RNF2-BMI1 function by siRNA knockdown or overexpression of the ligase-dead RNF2 mutant all leads to significant defects both in accumulation of \u03b3-H2AX, p-ATM, and MDC1 at DSBs and in activation of NBS1 and CHK2. Additionally, the regulatory effect of RNF2-BMI1 on \u03b3-H2AX formation is dependent on ATM. Lacking their ability to properly activate the DNA damage signaling pathway, RNF2-BMI1 complex-depleted cells exhibit impaired DNA repair and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Together, our findings demonstrate a distinct monoubiquitination-dependent mechanism that is required for H2AX phosphorylation and the initiation of DDR.",

A peptide covering this segment stimulated ATPase activity of purified HSP70-1A. (ii) A GST fusion protein comprising the C terminus of SERT pulled down HSP70-1A. The interaction between HSP70-1A and SERT was visualized in live cells by F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer: it was restricted to endoplasmic reticulum-resident transporters and enhanced by an inhibitor that traps HSP70-1A in its closed state. (iv) Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed complex formation of SERT with HSP70-1A and HSP90\u03b2. Consistent with an HSP relay, co-chaperones (e.g. HSC70-HSP90-organizing protein) were co-immunoprecipitated with the stalled mutants SERT-R607A/I608A and SERT-P601A/G602A.

FRMD7 is expressed in the brain and knock-down studies suggest it plays a role in neurite extension through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, yet little is known about its precise molecular function and the effects of IIN mutations. Here, we studied four IIN-associated missense mutants and found them to have diverse effects on FRMD7 expression and cytoplasmic localization. The C271Y mutant accumulates in the nucleus, possibly due to disruption of a nuclear export sequence located downstream of the FERM-adjacent domain. While overexpression of wild-type FRMD7 promotes neurite outgrowth, mutants reduce this effect to differing degrees and the nuclear localizing C271Y mutant acts in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit neurite formation. To gain insight into FRMD7 molecular function, we used an IP-MS approach and identified the multi-domain plasma membrane scaffolding protein, CASK, as a FRMD7 interactor. Importantly, CASK promotes FRMD7 co-localization at the plasma membrane, where it enhances CASK-induced neurite length, whereas IIN-associated FRMD7 mutations impair all of these features. Mutations in CASK cause X-linked mental retardation. Patients with C-terminal CASK mutations also present with nystagmus and, strikingly, we show that these mutations specifically disrupt interaction with FRMD7. Together, our data strongly support a model whereby CASK recruits FRMD7 to the plasma membrane to promote neurite outgrowth during development of the oculomotor neural network and that defects in this interaction result in nystagmus.",

Here, we identified S100A10 as the first auxiliary protein of these epithelial Ca(2+) channels using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. This S100 protein forms a heterotetrameric complex with annexin 2 and associates specifically with the conserved sequence VATTV located in the C-terminal tail of TRPV5 and TRPV6. Of these five amino acids, the first threonine plays a crucial role since the corresponding mutants (TRPV5 T599A and TRPV6 T600A) exhibited a diminished capacity to bind S100A10, were redistributed to a subplasma membrane area and did not display channel activity. Using GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrated that annexin 2 is part of the TRPV5-S100A10 complex. Furthermore, the S100A10-annexin 2 pair colocalizes with the Ca(2+) channels in TRPV5-expressing renal tubules and TRPV6-expressing duodenal cells. Importantly, downregulation of annexin 2 using annexin 2-specific small interfering RNA inhibited TRPV5 and TRPV6-mediated currents in transfected HEK293 cells. In conclusion, the S100A10-annexin 2 complex plays a crucial role in routing of TRPV5 and TRPV6 to plasma membrane.",

          "text": "p190 RhoGAP is a 190-kDa protein that stably associates with p120 RasGAP and regulates actin dynamics through members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Previous studies have indicated a direct relationship between levels of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation, the extent and kinetics of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced actin rearrangements, and EGF-induced cell cycle progression, suggesting that p190 links Ras-mediated mitogenic signaling with signaling through the actin cytoskeleton. Determining which tyrosine residues in p190 are phosphorylated, what factors regulate phosphorylation of these sites, and what effect tyrosine phosphorylation has on p190 function is key to understanding the role(s) that p190 may play in these processes. To begin investigating these questions, we used biochemical approaches to characterize the number and relative levels of in vivo-phosphorylated tyrosine residues on endogenous p190 from C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts. Only two tryptic phosphopeptides containing phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr), a major site, identified as Y1105, and a minor, unidentified site, were detected. Phosphorylation of Y1105, but not the minor site, was modulated in vivo to a greater extent by overexpression of c-Src than by the EGF receptor and was efficiently catalyzed by c-Src in vitro, indicating that Y1105 is a selective and preferential target of c-Src both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro and in vivo coprecipitation analysis using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing wild-type and Y1105F variants of the p190 middle domain, variants of full-length p190 ectopically expressed in COS-7 cells, and endogenous p190 and p120 in C3H10T1/2 cells revealed that p190 could bind to p120 in the presence and absence of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation. p-Tyr-independent complexes comprised 10 to 20% of the complexes formed in the presence of p-Tyr. Mutation of Y1105 from Tyr to Phe resulted in complete loss of p-Tyr-dependent complex formation, indicating that p-Y1105 was the sole p-Tyr residue mediating binding to p120. These studies describe a specific mechanism by which c-Src can regulate p190-p120 association and also document a significant role for p-Tyr-independent means of p190-p120 binding.",

The conserved NPLY sequence represents a potential beta-turn motif in the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of beta(3) integrins with talin. In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin beta(3) subunit to test the functional significance of this beta-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant beta(3) and wild type alpha(IIb). Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3), purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin beta(3) subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY beta-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.",

In the present work, we have investigated the regions of p14(ARF) involved in this interaction by using targeted point mutagenesis and deletion mutants. A region encompassing exon 2-encoded sequence was required for physical binding of p14(ARF) to Topo I as well as for stimulatory activity of the enzyme. Exon 1 beta-encoded segment was not implicated in the interaction. Moreover, among p14(ARF) point mutants selected for their high conservation among different mammalian species, mutant p14(ARF) (RR87, 88AA) did not stimulate Topo I in spite of its association with the enzyme, suggesting its direct implication in the functional activity of ARF. In contrast, one mutant, p14(ARF) (R71A), was more efficient than wild-type protein to activate Topo I, suggesting that this residue is a key element to modulate Topo I activity. Finally, only ARF-Topo I complexes containing p14(ARF) exon 2 segment were found to be localized in the nucleolus, suggesting that this subnuclear location is linked to the biological function of the ARF-Topo I complex.",

Exposure of some tissues and cells to EGF also stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity and results in an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Because cAMP activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), we investigated the effect of PKA on the EGFR. The purified catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) stoichiometrically phosphorylated the purified full-length wild type (WT) and kinase negative (K721M) forms of the EGFR. PKAc phosphorylated both WT-EGFR as well as a mutant truncated form of EGFR (Delta1022-1186) exclusively on serine residues. Moreover, PKAc also phosphorylated the cytosolic domain of the EGFR (EGFRKD). Phosphorylation of the purified WT as well as EGFRDelta1022-1186 and EGFRKD was accompanied by decreased autophosphorylation and diminished tyrosine kinase activity. Pretreatment of REF-52 cells with the nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, decreased EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins as well as activation of the WT-EGFR. Similar effects were also observed in B82L cells transfected to express the Delta1022-1186 form of EGFR. Furthermore, activation of PKAc in intact cells resulted in serine phosphorylation of the EGFR. The decreased phosphorylation of cellular proteins and diminished activation of the EGFR in cells treated with the cAMP analog was not the result of altered binding of EGF to its receptors or changes in receptor internalization. Therefore, we conclude that PKA phosphorylates the EGFR on Ser residues and decreases its tyrosine kinase activity and signal transduction both in vitro and in vivo.",

Each mutant receptor was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, insulin binding, and biosynthetic labeling. All mutant receptors exhibited normal affinity for insulin. Pulse-chase experiments showed that each proreceptor was processed into alpha- and beta-subunits, although the rate of IR/TMV----D conversion was reduced approximately 3-fold. With IR/TMPDGFR, IR/TMV----D, and IR/TM+3 basal and insulin-stimulated levels of autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activation were normal, both in wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-purified receptor preparations and intact cells. By contrast, following WGA purification or isolation of crude membranes, IR/TMc-neu was a constitutively active autokinase and substrate kinase in vitro. However, in intact cells insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation and kinase activity appeared normal. We conclude that although there is considerable latitude in acceptable structure, residues within the insulin receptor transmembrane domain can play a functional role in regulation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity.",

Modification in vitro requires only SUMO-1, the SUMO-1 activating enzyme and ubc9. SUMO-1 and ubiquitin modification do not compete for the same lysine acceptor sites in p53. Overexpression of SUMO-1 activates the transcriptional activity of wild-type p53, but not K386R p53 where the SUMO-1 acceptor site has been mutated.

To modify this capability, three analogs, bPL(K73D), bPL(K73F) and bPL(K73A), mutated at position 73, and corresponding to R64 in human GH (hGH), were produced in Escherichia coli. Circular dichroic spectrum analyses indicated proper refolding in all cases. Biological activity of these analogs was tested in vitro. In a lactogenic-receptor-mediated Nb2 rat lymphoma cell bioassay, bPL and its analogs acted similarly. In another lactogenic bioassay that measures beta-casein synthesis by HC-11 mouse mammary-gland cells, the analogs were 30-40% as potent as bPL. In contrast, somatogenic receptor-mediated bioactivity in FDC-P1 cells transfected with either rabbit (rb) or hGH receptor (R) was almost completely abolished in these analogs. In receptor binding assays, the effect was more conspicuous and the mutations affected not only somatogenic but also lactogenic binding. Binding to rat (r) and rabbit PRL receptor extracellular domains (ECDs) or membrane-embedded receptors was only slightly changed, except for bPL (K73D), which displayed very low affinity. In somatogenic binding assays to intact IM-9 human lymphocytes, hGHR-ECD or bovine liver membranes, bPL (K73D) did not bind at all, and bPL(K73F) or bPL(K73A) binding was drastically reduced. Binding experiments performed in real time using a BIAcore apparatus revealed that the decreased binding could be mainly attributed to increased k(off) rather than decreased k(on) values. The complex with hGHR-ECD revealed a 2:1 stoichiometry with bPL, bPL(K73F) and bPL(K73A), although the complex with these analogs was less stable than with bPL, whereas bPL(K73D) scarcely assembled a 1:1 complex. In contrast, bPL and the three analogs formed stable 1:2 complexes with rPRL-ECD. These results suggest that position 73 in bPL is more important for somatogenic than lactogenic properties and concurs with results from other groups, which have shown that R64, the analogous amino acid in hGH holds the same differential importance with respect to somatogenic binding.",

We made 10 independent mutants, replacing a single amino acid within the EGF-like domain of human DTR/proHB-EGF with the corresponding amino acid residue in mouse proHB-EGF. The mutant proteins were transiently expressed in mouse L cells either expressing or not expressing DRAP27/CD9, and DT binding was measured.

The S113E mutant of IDH significantly improves its ability to utilize isopropylmalate as a substrate and switches the substrate specificity (k(cat)/K(M)) from isocitrate to isopropylmalate. To understand the structural basis for this switch in substrate specificity, we have determined the crystal structure of IDH S113E in a complex with isopropylmalate, NADP, and Mg(2+) to 2.0 A resolution. On the basis of a comparison with previously determined structures, we identify distinct changes caused by the amino acid substitution and by the binding of substrates. The S113E complex exhibits alterations in global and active site conformations compared with other IDH structures that include loop and helix conformational changes near the active site. In addition, the angle of the hinge that relates the two domains was altered in this structure, which suggests that the S113E substitution and the binding of substrates act together to promote catalysis of isopropylmalate. Ligand binding results in reorientation of the active site helix that contains residues 113 through 116. E113 exhibits new interactions, including van der Waals contacts with the isopropyl group of isopropylmalate and a hydrogen bond with N115, which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with NADP. In addition, the loop and helix regions that bind NADP are altered, as is the loop that connects the NADP binding region to the active site helix, changing the relationship between substrates and enzyme. In combination, these interactions appear to provide the basis for the switch in substrate specificity.",

          "text": "Association of the Golgi-specific adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) with the membrane is a prerequisite for clathrin coat assembly on the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The AP-1 adaptor is efficiently recruited from cytosol onto the TGN by myristoylated ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) in the presence of the poorly hydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS). Substituting GTP for GTPgammaS, however, results in only poor AP-1 binding. Here we show that both AP-1 and clathrin can be recruited efficiently onto the TGN in the presence of GTP when cytosol is supplemented with ARF1. Optimal recruitment occurs at 4 microM ARF1 and with 1 mM GTP. The AP-1 recruited by ARF1.GTP is released from the Golgi membrane by treatment with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7) or upon reincubation at 37 degreesC, whereas AP-1 recruited with GTPgammaS or by a constitutively active point mutant, ARF1(Q71L), remains membrane bound after either treatment. An incubation performed with added ARF1, GTP, and AlFn, used to block ARF GTPase-activating protein activity, results in membrane-associated AP-1, which is largely insensitive to Tris extraction. Thus, ARF1. GTP hydrolysis results in lower-affinity binding of AP-1 to the TGN. Using two-stage assays in which ARF1.GTP first primes the Golgi membrane at 37 degreesC, followed by AP-1 binding on ice, we find that the high-affinity nucleating sites generated in the priming stage are rapidly lost. In addition, the AP-1 bound to primed Golgi membranes during a second-stage incubation on ice is fully sensitive to Tris extraction, indicating that the priming stage has passed the ARF1.GTP hydrolysis point. Thus, hydrolysis of ARF1.GTP at the priming sites can occur even before AP-1 binding. Our finding that purified clathrin-coated vesicles contain little ARF1 supports the concept that ARF1 functions in the coat assembly process rather than during the vesicle-uncoating step. We conclude that ARF1 is a limiting factor in the GTP-stimulated recruitment of AP-1 in vitro and that it appears to function in a stoichiometric manner to generate high-affinity AP-1 binding sites that have a relatively short half-life.",

Exposure of Mv1Lu cells to TGF-beta1 rapidly resulted in down-regulation of cytosolic IkappaBalpha and hyaluronidase prevented this effect, suggesting a possible role of IkappaBalpha in the growth regulation. Ectopic expression of wild-type and dominant negative IkappaBalpha prevented TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Nonetheless, the blocking effect of IkappaBalpha is not related to regulation of NF-kappaB function by its N-terminal ankyrin-repeat region (amino acids 1-243). Removal of the PEST (proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domain-containing C terminus (amino acids 244-314) abolished the IkappaBalpha function, and the C terminus alone blocked the TGF-beta1 growth-inhibitory effect. Co-immunoprecipitation by anti-p53 antibody using Mv1Lu and other types of cells, as well as rat liver and spleen, revealed that a portion of cytosolic IkappaBalpha physically interacted with p53. In contrast, Mdm2, an inhibitor of p53, was barely detectable in the immunoprecipitates. The cytosolic p53 x IkappaBalpha complex rapidly dissociated in response to apoptotic stress, etoposide- and UV-mediated DNA damage, hypoxia, and TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Also, a rapid increase in the formation of the nuclear p53 x IkappaBalpha complex was observed during exposure to etoposide and UV. In contrast, TGF-beta1-mediated promotion of fibroblast growth failed to mediate p53 x IkappaBalpha dissociation. Mapping by yeast two-hybrid showed that the non-ankyrin C terminus of IkappaBalpha physically interacted with the proline-rich region and a phosphorylation site, serine 46, in p53. Deletion of serine 46 or alteration of serine 46 to glycine abolished the p53 x IkappaBalpha interaction. Alteration to threonine retained the binding interaction, suggesting that serine 46 phosphorylation is involved in the p53 x IkappaBalpha complex formation. Functionally, enhancement of p53 apoptosis was observed when p53 and IkappaBalpha were transiently co-expressed in cells. Together, the IkappaBalpha x p53 complex plays an important role in responses involving growth regulation, apoptosis, and hypoxic stress.",

Surprisingly, this decarboxylation reaction is carried out as an FMN-dependent redox reaction. In the first half-reaction, the side-chain of the cysteine residue of 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine is oxidised and the thioaldehyde intermediate decarboxylates spontaneously to the 4'-phosphopantothenoyl-aminoethenethiol intermediate. In the second half-reaction this compound is reduced to 4'-phosphopantetheine and the FMNH(2) cofactor is re-oxidised. The active site mutant C175S is unable to perform this reductive half-reaction. Here, we present the crystal structure of the AtHAL3a mutant C175S in complex with the reaction intermediate pantothenoyl-aminoethenethiol and FMNH(2). The geometry of binding suggests that reduction of the C(alpha)=C(beta) double bond of the intermediate can be performed by direct hydride-transfer from N5 of FMNH(2) to C(beta) of the aminoethenethiol-moiety supported by a protonation of C(alpha) by Cys175. The binding mode of the substrate is very similar to that previously observed for a pentapeptide to the homologous enzyme EpiD that introduces the aminoethenethiol-moiety as final reaction product at the C terminus of peptidyl-cysteine residues. This finding further supports our view that these homologous enzymes form a protein family of homo-oligomeric flavin-containing cysteine decarboxylases, which we have termed HFCD family.",

We demonstrate here that morphine stimulation of the mu-opioid (OP3) receptor causes rapid CaM translocation to the nucleus in OP3-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells and in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Ca2+ influx into the cells resulting from OP3 receptor activation was required for nuclear CaM translocation. Moreover, in HEK-OP3 and SH-SY5Y cells, increased nuclear CaM content was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein. This appeared to be mediated by Ca2+/CaM kinases and also by a pathway involving protein kinase C. CaM was previously shown to bind directly to the OP3 receptor and to be released from the plasma membrane on agonist stimulation. To test whether OP3-mediated CaM release contributes to nuclear CaM signaling, we used a mutant OP3 receptor (K273A) with reduced affinity for CaM that fails to release CaM from the plasma membrane. K273A-OP3 activated Ca2+ influx to a similar extent as wild-type OP3; however, CaM translocation to the nucleus was attenuated. These results indicate that OP3-stimulated Ca2+ influx results in nuclear CaM translocation, which appears to be enhanced by simultaneous CaM release by OP3 wild-type receptor from plasma membranes. These results suggest a novel Ca2+/CaM signaling pathway of opioid receptors in the regulation of transcriptional activity.",

While CCLs share similar tertiary structures, oligomerization produces highly diverse quaternary structures that protect chemokines from proteolytic degradation and modulate their functions. CCL18 is closely related to CCL3 and CCL4 with respect to both protein sequence and genomic location, yet CCL18 has distinct biochemical and biophysical properties. Here, we report a crystal structure of human CCL18 and its oligomerization states in solution based on crystallographic and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses. Our data show that CCL18 adopts an \u03b1-helical conformation at its N-terminus that weakens its dimerization, explaining CCL18's preference for the monomeric state. Multiple contacts between monomers allow CCL18 to reversibly form a unique open-ended oligomer different from those of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Furthermore, these differences hinge on proline 8, which is conserved in CCL3 and CCL4 but is replaced by lysine in human CCL18. Our structural analyses suggest that a mutation of proline 8 to alanine stabilizes a type 1 \u03b2-turn at the N-terminus of CCL4 to prevent dimerization but prevents dimers from making key contacts with each other in CCL3. Thus, the P8A mutation induces depolymerization of CCL3 and CCL4 by distinct mechanisms. Finally, we used structural, biochemical, and functional analyses to unravel why insulin-degrading enzyme degrades CCL3 and CCL4 but not CCL18. Our results elucidate the molecular basis for the oligomerization of three closely related CC chemokines and suggest how oligomerization shapes CCL chemokine function.",

This mutation was only identified in the inbred Manitoba Hutterite or their descendants. Interestingly, a mutation in the B-box domain of TRIM32 cosegregates with Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11 (BBS11). The signs of BBS11 include obesity, pigmentary and retinal malformations, diabetes, polydactyly, and no muscular dystrophy, suggesting an alternative disease mechanism. We aim to ascertain whether D487N is the only pathological LGMD2H allele, limited to Hutterites. We studied the TRIM32 gene in 310 LGMD patients with no mutations at the other known loci. We identified four patients with novel mutated alleles. Two mutations were homozygous and missing in controls. These mutations also clustered at the NHL domain, suggesting that a specific (interaction) property might be abolished in LGMD2H patients. No mutations were found at the B-box region where the BBS11 mutation is found. We tested TRIM32 and its mutants by yeast-two-hybrid assay, developing an interaction test to validate mutations. All LGMD2H mutants, but not the BBS11, lost their ability to self-interact. The interaction of TRIM32 mutants with E2N, a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, was similarly impaired.

This domain functions as a binding site for p53 and other DNA damage and repair proteins that contain amphipathic alpha helical domains. Here, we demonstrate direct binding of both ssDNA and the transactivation domain 2 of p53 (p53TAD2) to DBD-F, as well as DBD-F-directed dsDNA strand separation by RPA, all of which are inhibited by fumaropimaric acid (FPA). FPA binds directly to RPA, resulting in a conformational shift as determined through quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in full length RPA. Structural analogues of FPA provide insight on chemical properties that are required for inhibition. Finally, we confirm the inability of RPA possessing R41E and R43E mutations to bind to p53, destabilize dsDNA and quench tryptophan fluorescence by FPA, suggesting that protein binding, DNA modulation and inhibitor binding all occur within the same site on DBD-F. The disruption of p53-RPA interactions by FPA may disturb the regulatory functions of p53 and RPA, thereby inhibiting cellular pathways that control the cell cycle and maintain the integrity of the human genome.",

It is reported that GRK2 could down-regulate the mGluR5 signaling in both HEK 293 cells and neurons. However, whether GRK2-mediated mGluR5 desensitization is phosphorylation dependent remains controversial. Here, we demonstrated that the signal intensity and kinetics of mGluRS desensitization was inhibited or changed by GRK2 in HEK 293 cells. By using the catalytically inactive GRK2 mutant K220R, and the receptor mutants that lack potential phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail, we demonstrated that the GRK2-mediated mGluR5 desensitization was phosphorylation-independent. Furthermore, overexpression of an N-terminal regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology (RH) domain of GRK2 was sufficient to attenuate the mGluR5 signaling, whereas the expression of GRK2 D110A mutant devoid in Galphaq binding was unable to inhibit mGluRS signaling. In summary, this study provides evidence that GRK2 mediates phosphorylation-independent mGluR5 desensitization via the interaction between the RGS domain and Galphaq in HEK 293 cells.",

We show that knockdown of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP5 (isopeptidase T) results in an increase in the level and transcriptional activity of p53. Suppression of USP5 stabilizes p53, whereas it has little or no effect on the stability of Mdm2. This provides a mechanism for transcriptional activation of p53. USP5 knockdown interferes with the degradation of ubiquitinated p53 rather than attenuating p53 ubiquitination. In vitro studies have shown that a preferred substrate for USP5 is unanchored polyubiquitin. Consistent with this, we observed for the first time in a mammalian system that USP5 makes a major contribution to Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin disassembly and that suppression of USP5 results in the accumulation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains. Ectopic expression of a C-terminal mutant of ubiquitin (G75A/G76A), which also causes the accumulation of free polyubiquitin, recapitulates the effects of USP5 knockdown on the p53 pathway. We propose a model in which p53 is selectively stabilized because the unanchored polyubiquitin that accumulates after USP5 knockdown is able to compete with ubiquitinated p53 but not with Mdm2 for proteasomal recognition. This raises the possibility that there are significant differences in proteasomal recognition of p53 and Mdm2. These differences could be exploited therapeutically. Our study reveals a novel mechanism for regulation of p53 and identifies USP5 as a potential target for p53 activating therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer.",

All three processes may lead to recruitment of the PLCgamma isozymes to the plasma membrane and/or stimulation of their catalytic activity. Recent evidence suggests that PLCgamma may also be regulated by Rho GTPases. In this study, PLCgamma(1) and PLCgamma(2) were reconstituted in intact cells and in a cell-free system with Rho GTPases to examine their influence on PLCgamma activity. PLCgamma(2), but not PLCgamma(1), was markedly activated in intact cells by constitutively active Rac1(G12V), Rac2(G12V), and Rac3(G12V) but not by Cdc42(G12V) and RhoA(G14V). The mechanism of PLCgamma(2) activation was apparently independent of phosphorylation of tyrosine residues known to be modified by PLCgamma(2)-activating protein-tyrosine kinases. Activation of PLCgamma(2) by Rac2(G12V) in intact cells coincided with a translocation of PLCgamma(2) from the soluble to the particulate fraction. PLCgamma isozyme-specific activation of PLCgamma(2) by Rac GTPases (Rac1 approximately Rac2 > Rac3), but not by Cdc42 or RhoA, was also observed in a cell-free system. Herein, activation of wild-type Rac GTPases with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate caused a marked stimulation of PLCgamma(2) but had no effect on the activity of PLCgamma(1). PLCgamma(1) and PLCgamma(2) have previously been shown to be indiscriminately activated by PtdInsP(3) in vitro. Thus, the results suggest a novel mechanism of PLCgamma(2) activation by Rac GTPases involving neither protein tyrosine phosphorylation nor PI3K-mediated generation of PtdInsP(3).",

The molecular mechanisms by which domains regulate the activity of PLD--especially the phox homology (PX) domain--have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we have examined the properties of the PX domains of PLD1 and PLD2 in terms of phosphoinositide binding and PLD activity regulation. Interestingly, the PX domain of PLD1, but not that of PLD2, was found to specifically interact with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). We found that mutation of the conserved arginine at position 179 of the PLD1 PX domain to lysine or to alanine (R179A or R179K, respectively) disrupts PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding. In NIH-3T3 cells, the EGFP-PLD1 PX wild-type domain, but not the two mutants, localized to the plasma membrane after 5-minute treatment with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The enzymatic activity of PLD1 was stimulated by adding PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vitro. Treatment with PDGF resulted in the significant increase of PLD1 activity and phosphorylation of the downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which was blocked by pre-treatment of HEK 293 cells with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor after the endogenous PLD2 had been depleted by siRNA specific for PLD2. Nevertheless, both PLD1 mutants (which cannot interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) did not respond to treatment with PDGF. Moreover, PLD1 was activated in HepG2 cells stably expressing the Y40/51 mutant of PDGF receptor that is required for the binding with PI3K. Our results suggest that the PLD1 PX domain enables PLD1 to mediate signal transduction via ERK1/2 by providing a direct binding site for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and by activating PLD1.",

Co-transfection of Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 into COS-7 cells showed that they also associate with each other in mammalian cells. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) 'pull-down' assays indicated that the N-terminal domain and N-terminal part of the T-box of Tbx5 and the homeodomain of Nkx2-5 were necessary for their interaction. Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 directly bound to the promoter of the gene for cardiac-specific natriuretic peptide precursor type A (Nppa) in tandem, and both transcription factors showed synergistic activation. Deletion analysis showed that both the N-terminal domain and T-box of Tbx5 were important for this transactivation. A G80R mutation of Tbx5, which causes substantial cardiac defects with minor skeletal abnormalities in HOS, did not activate Nppa or show synergistic activation, whereas R237Q, which causes upper-limb malformations without cardiac abnormalities, activated the Nppa promoter to a similar extent to that of wildtype Tbx5. P19CL6 cell lines overexpressing wildtype Tbx5 started to beat earlier and expressed cardiac-specific genes more abundantly than did parental P19CL6 cells, whereas cell lines expressing the G80R mutant did not differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes.

These residues surround a hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal domain of TnC which, when Ca2+ binds to regulatory sites in this domain, is exposed and interacts with the inhibitory region of troponin I (TnI). We constructed three double mutants (E53A/E54A, E60A/E61A, and E85A/D86A) and two single mutants (R44A and R81A) of rabbit fast skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC) in which the charged residues were replaced with neutral alanines. All five of these mutants retained TnC's ability to bind TnI in a Ca2+-dependent manner, to neutralize TnI's inhibition of actomyosin S1 ATPase activity, and to form a ternary complex with TnI and troponin T (TnT). Ternary complexes formed with TnC(R44A) or TnC(R81A) regulated actomyosin S1 ATPase activity normally, with TnI-based inhibition in the absence of Ca2+ and TnT-based activation in the presence of Ca2+. TnC(E53A/E54A) and TnC(E85A/D86A) interacted weakly with TnT, as judged by native gel electrophoresis. Ternary complexes formed with these mutants inhibited actomyosin S1 ATPase activity in both the presence and absence of Ca2+, and did not undergo Ca2+-dependent structural changes in TnI which can be detected by limited chymotryptic digestion. TnC(E60A/E61A) interacted normally with TnT. Its ternary complex showed Ca2+-dependent structural changes in TnI, inhibited actomyosin S1 ATPase in the absence of Ca2+, but did not activate ATPase in the presence of Ca2+. This is the first demonstration that selective mutation of TnC can abolish the activating effect of troponin while its inhibitory function is retained. Our results suggest the existence of an elaborate network of protein-protein interactions formed by TnI, TnT, and the N-terminal domain of TnC, all of which are important in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of muscle contraction.",

VPS35 is a component of the retromer complex, which mediates endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of membrane proteins such as the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Furthermore, retromer is also required for the endosomal recruitment of the actin nucleation promoting WASH complex. The VPS35 D620N mutation causes a rare form of autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we show that this mutant associates poorly with the WASH complex and impairs WASH recruitment to endosomes. Autophagy is impaired in cells expressing PD-mutant VPS35 or lacking WASH. The autophagy defects can be explained, at least in part, by abnormal trafficking of the autophagy protein ATG9A. Thus, the PD-causing D620N mutation in VPS35 restricts WASH complex recruitment to endosomes, and reveals a novel role for the WASH complex in autophagosome formation. ",

DBC1 depletion in human cells increases SIRT1 activity, resulting in the deacetylation of p53 and protection from apoptosis. However, the mechanisms regulating this process have not yet been determined. Here, we report that, in human cell lines, DNA damage triggered the phosphorylation of DBC1 on Thr454 by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinases. Phosphorylated DBC1 bound to and inhibited SIRT1, resulting in the dissociation of the SIRT1-p53 complex and stimulating p53 acetylation and p53-dependent cell death. Indeed, DBC1-mediated genotoxicity, which was shown in knockdown experiments to be dependent on SIRT1 and p53 expression, was defective in cells expressing the phospho-mutant DBC1(T454A).

Because activation of GRK2 may involve phosphorylation of its N-terminal tyrosines by c-Src, we tested whether the PDGFRbeta itself could tyrosine-phosphorylate and activate GRK2. To do so, we used wild type (WT) and Y857F mutant PDGFRbetas in HEK cells, which lack endogenous PDGFRs. The Y857F PDGFRbeta autophosphorylates normally but does not phosphorylate exogenous substrates. Although PDGF-stimulated Y857F and WT PDGFRbetas activated c-Src equivalently, the WT PDGFRbeta tyrosine-phosphorylated GKR2 60-fold more than the Y857F PDGFRbeta in intact cells. With purified GRK2 and either WT or Y857F PDGFRbetas immunoprecipitated from HEK cells, GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation was PDGF-dependent and required the WT PDGFRbeta, even though the WT and Y857F PDGFRbetas autophosphorylated equivalently. This PDGFRbeta-mediated GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation enhanced GRK2 activity: GRK2-mediated seryl phosphorylation of the PDGFRbeta was 9-fold greater for the WT than for the Y857F in response to PDGF, but equivalent when GRK2 was activated by sequential stimulation of beta2-adrenergic and PDGF-beta receptors. Furthermore, both PDGFRbeta-mediated GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and GRK2-mediated PDGFRbeta seryl phosphorylation were reduced approximately 50% in intact cells by mutation to phenylalanine of three tyrosines in the N-terminal domain of GRK2. We conclude that the activated PDGFRbeta itself phosphorylates GRK2 tyrosyl residues and thereby activates GRK2, which then serine-phosphorylates and desensitizes the PDGFRbeta.",

Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 activation is a prerequisite for transformation in KSHV-GPCR and CXCR2 transfected NIH 3T3 cells. In KSHV-GPCR and D138V transfected cells, STAT-3 is constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr705. In CXCR2 transfected NIH 3T3 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC), which express the CXCR2 constitutively, STAT3 is phosphorylated upon stimulation with IL-8 (CXCL8). Focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the KSHV-GPCR, CXCR2, or the D138V mutant, was blocked by the specific JAK2 inhibitor AG490. Typical functions of the CXCR2 including actin stress fiber formation, haptotaxis, and the angiogenic response in HMEC shown by tube formation in Matrigel were blocked by AG490.

Furthermore, eluted peptide spectra and the class I-mediated inhibition of NK clones showed distinct differences to the hTpn transfectant. Only wild-type hTpn efficiently recruited HC and calreticulin (Crt) into complexes with TAP and endoplasmic reticulum p57 (ERp57). The L410F mutant was defective in TAP association, but bound to class I molecules, Crt, and ERp57. Mouse Tpn associated with human TAP and ERp57 on the one hand, and with HC and Crt on the other, but failed to recruit normal amounts of HLA class I molecules into the TAP complex.

The activated Jak2-V617F mutant is present in most cases of BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms and constitutively activates downstream signals from homodimeric cytokine receptors, such as the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). Here we examine the effects of DNA damage stress on Jak2 or Jak2-V617F and on induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells. Etoposide or doxorubicin dose-dependently decreased the expression level of Jak2 in UT7 or 32D cells expressing EpoR in the absence of Epo and that of exogenously expressed Jak2-V617F in UT7 cells when cotreated with the Jak2 inhibitor JakI-1 or AG490. Studies with pharmacological inhibitors and genetic manipulations further showed that downregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway leading to the activation of GSK3\u03b2 may be involved in downregulation of Jak2 or Jak2-V617F as well as in synergistic induction of Bax activation and apoptosis. The downregulation of Jak2 was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or by expression of both of loss-of-function mutants of c-Cbl and Cbl-b, E3 ubiquitin ligases which facilitated ubiquitination of Jak2-V617F when co-expressed in 293T cells. The pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-d-fmk also inhibited the Jak2 downregulation as well as appearance of a 100-kDa fragment that contained the N-terminal portion of Jak2 in response to DNA damage. Together, these data suggest that DNA damage stress with simultaneous inhibition of the kinase activity causes degradation of Jak2 or Jak2-V617F by caspase cleavage and proteasomal degradation through GSK3\u03b2 activation, which is closely involved in synergistic induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells.",

Recently, it was shown that the level of CNF1-activated Rac is rapidly diminished in CNF1-treated cells by proteolytic degradation. Here, we studied the requirements for CNF1-induced Rac degradation. By overexpressing His-tagged activated Rac mutants we show that constitutive activation is necessary for degradation of Rac. However, permanent activation is not sufficient for degradation, because Rac that is constitutively activated by transamidation at glutamine 61 by the Bordetella dermonecrotic toxin is not degraded. Overexpression of His-tagged Rac mutants deficient in interaction with GTPase-activating protein (Rac(N92D) and Rac(Y64H)) and guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rac(H103E)) were degraded after activation by CNF1, whereas Rac(Y40C), which is not able to interact with CRIB domain effectors or plenty of SH3, was not degraded. Isoprenylation and the presence of a putative mitotic destruction box are essential for CNF-induced degradation. In contrast to Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3 were not degraded following constitutive activation by CNF1.

In addition, five other residues flanking F148 were also mutated to alanine. The resulting mutants were assayed for transformation of NIH3T3 cells, and the mutant proteins were assayed for their ability to dimerize. Four residues were found to be crucial for disulfide-linked dimer formation: P152 and G162 were mandatory, while R159 and H205 also contributed to efficient dimerization. Four of the mutant proteins (at residues N147, F148, L149 and K185) dimerized efficiently yet exhibited less than 50% transforming activity compared with wild-type v-sis. Two mutants (at residues D142 and F148) were located in a region important for PDGF receptor interaction and were further studied with regard to secretion and PDGF receptor autophosphorylation. A series of substitutions at residue F148 revealed a strong preference for aromatic amino acids. One mutant from this series (F148G) dimerized but was completely inactive for transformation. This study thus identifies four residues in v-sis/PDGF-B important for dimerization and also identifies additional residues critical for full activation of PDGF receptors. The E5 oncoprotein encoded by bovine papillomavirus type I exhibits two short regions of amino acid similarity when compared with the minimal transforming region of v-sis/PDGF-B.

We show here that the Delta14 mutation of troponin T, associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, results in an increase in ATPase rate like that seen with wild-type troponin in the presence of NEM-S1. The enhanced ATPase activity was not due to a decreased incorporation of mutant troponin T with troponin I and troponin C to form an active troponin complex. The activating effect was more prominent with a hybrid troponin (skeletal TnI, TnC, and cardiac TnT) than with all cardiac troponin. Thus it appears that changes in the troponin-troponin contacts that result from mutations or from forming hybrids stabilize a more active state of regulated actin. An analysis of the effect of the Delta14 mutation on the equilibrium binding of S1-ADP to actin was consistent with stabilization of an active state of actin.

Inhibiting this phosphatase and preventing the insulin-receptor downregulation has been suggested as a target for the treatment of Type II diabetes. A high-throughput screen for inhibitors of PTP1B was developed using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) with GST-- or FLAG--PTP1B((1-320)) and a potent [(3)H]-tripeptide inhibitor. The problem of interference from extraneous oxidizing and alkylating agents which react with the cysteine active-site nucleophile was overcome by the use of the catalytically inactive C215S form of the native enzyme (GST--PTP1B(C215S)). The GST--PTP1B was linked to the protein A scintillation bead via GST antibody. The radiolabeled inhibitor when bound to the enzyme gave a radioactive signal that was competed away by the unknown competitive compounds. Further utility of PTP1B(C215S) was demonstrated by mixing in the same well both the catalytically inactive GST--PTP1B(C215S) and the catalytically active FLAG--CD45 with an inhibitor. Both a binding and kinetic assay was then performed in the same 96-well plate with the inhibition results determined for the PTP1B(C215S) (binding assay) and CD45 (activity assay). In this way inhibitors could be differentiated between the two phosphatases under identical assay conditions in one 96-well assay plate.

DDX5 is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and transcriptional modulator. We hypothesized that the activity of DDX5 in regulating fibrogenic gene transcription in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is altered by the S480A SNP. To test this, we employed two approaches: 1) transient overexpression of DDX5 cDNA or siRNA knockdown of endogenous DDX5, with replacement by either DDX5 wild type (WT) or SNP cDNA, or 2) stable expression of exogenous DDX5 WT and SNP in HSC lines. WT DDX5 mRNA in HSCs was inversely correlated with gene expression for alpha2(I) collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and transforming growth factor-beta1. Stable DDX5 SNP-expressing cells had higher basal and transforming growth factor-beta1-stimulated expression and enhanced promoter activities of fibrogenic genes. DDX5 variant-expressing cells also had higher Smad3 and AP-1-responsive reporter activities. In a one-hybrid GAL4 system, co-expression of the DDX5 SNP variant with chimeras of GAL4 DNA binding domain linked to JunD or Sp1 displayed higher transactivation of a GAL4-responsive reporter than that of DDX5 WT. Increased fibrogenic gene expression in DDX5 SNP-expressing cells was associated with reduced recruitment of DDX5 homodimers to responsive promoters, but there was no difference in the recruitment of the co-repressor HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1). These data suggest that DDX5 is a repressor of fibrogenic genes in HSCs through interaction with transcriptional complexes. The enhanced fibrogenic activity of the DDX5 risk variant is linked to a reduced repressive function toward these target genes.",

We used thyrotropin receptor, which is coupled to different G proteins, to investigate the regulation of Galphas- and Galphaq-mediated signaling (assessed by cAMP and inositol phosphate production, respectively). In transfected cells, both pathways were desensitized by GRK2. However a kinase-dead GRK2 mutant (GRK2-K220R) only decreased inositol phosphate production, indicating that GRK2 could regulate Galphaq signaling through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Similar results were obtained with serotonin receptor 5-hydroxytryptamine(2C), which is coupled to Galphaq. This effect was mimicked by the N-terminal domain of GRK2 (GRK2-Nter), but not by the C-terminal domain. In cells transfected with Galphaq, direct activation of Galphaq signaling (by AlF(4)(-)) was desensitized by GRK2-Nter, indicating an effect at the Galpha-level. For comparison, in parallel samples we studied a protein regulator of G protein signaling RGS4 and we found a similar regulatory profile. We therefore hypothesized that the GRK2-Nter could directly interact with the Galphaq subunit to regulate its signaling, as demonstrated for several RGS proteins. This hypothesis is further supported by the presence, within the GRK2-Nter, of an RGS homology domain. In direct binding experiments, we found that GRK2-Nter interacts with Galphaq (only when activated) but not with Galphas and Galphao. We conclude that GRK2, besides desensitizing the GPCR by phosphorylation, is able to selectively bind to Galphaq and to regulate its signaling.",

Several diseases are associated with the retention of misfolded proteins in the early secretory pathway. Among them is X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, caused by mutations in the gene encoding the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R). We studied the degradation pathways of three intracellularly retained V2R mutants with different misfolded domains in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. At steady state, the wild-type V2R and the complex-glycosylated mutant G201D were partially located in lysosomes, whereas core-glycosylated mutants L62P and V226E were excluded from this compartment. In pulse-chase experiments, proteasomal inhibition stabilized the nonglycosylated and core-glycosylated forms of all studied receptors. In addition, all mutants and the wild-type receptor were found to be polyubiquitinylated. Nonglycosylated and core-glycosylated receptor forms were located in cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively, confirming the deglycosylation and retrotranslocation of ERAD substrates to the cytosol. Distinct Derlin-1-dependent and -independent ERAD pathways have been proposed for proteins with different misfolded domains (cytosolic, extracellular, and membrane) in yeast. Here, we show for the first time that V2R mutants with different misfolded domains are able to coprecipitate the ERAD components p97/valosin-containing protein, Derlin-1 and the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit 7.

Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo. G protein alpha subunits are concentrated in purified preparations of caveolae membranes, and caveolin interacts directly with multiple G protein alpha subunits, including G(s), G(o), and G(i2). Mutational or pharmacologic activation of G alpha subunits prevents the interaction of caveolin with G proteins, indicating that inactive G alpha subunits preferentially interact with caveolin. Here, we show that caveolin interacts with another well characterized signal transducer, Ras. Using a detergent-free procedure for purification of caveolin-rich membrane domains and a polyhistidine tagged form of caveolin, we find that Ras and other classes of lipid-modified signaling molecules co-fractionate and co-elute with caveolin. The association of Ras with caveolin was further evaluated using two distinct in vitro binding assays. Wild-type H-Ras interacted with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin fusion proteins but not with GST alone. Using a battery of GST fusion proteins encoding distinct regions of caveolin, Ras binding activity was localized to a 41-amino acid membrane proximal region of the cytosolic N-terminal domain of caveolin. In addition, reconstituted caveolin-rich membranes (prepared with purified recombinant caveolin and purified lipids) interacted with a soluble form of wild-type H-Ras but failed to interact with mutationally activated soluble H-Ras (G12V). Thus, a single amino acid change (G12V) that constitutively activates Ras prevents or destabilizes this interaction. These results clearly indicate that (i) caveolin is sufficient to recruit soluble Ras onto lipid membranes and (ii) membrane-bound caveolin preferentially interacts with inactive Ras proteins. In direct support of these in vitro studies, we also show that recombinant overexpression of caveolin in intact cells is sufficient to functionally recruit a nonfarnesylated mutant of Ras (C186S) onto membranes, overcoming the normal requirement for lipid modification of Ras. Taken together, these observations suggest that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein to localize or sequester certain caveolin-interacting proteins, such as wild-type Ras, within caveolin-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane.",

HDV genome encodes two forms of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), small HDAg (HDAg-S), which is required for viral replication, and large HDAg (HDAg-L), which is essential for viral assembly. HDAg-L is identical to HDAg-S except that it bears a 19-amino acid extension at the C terminus. Both HDAgs contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), but only HDAg-L contains a CRM1-independent nuclear export signal at its C terminus. The nuclear export activity of HDAg-L is important for HDV particle formation. However, the mechanisms of HDAg-L-mediated nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein are not clear. In this study, the host cellular RNA export complex TAP-Aly was found to form a complex with HDAg-L, but not with an export-defective HDAg-L mutant, in which Pro(205) was replaced by Ala. HDAg-L was found to colocalize with TAP and Aly in the nucleus. The C-terminal domain of HDAg-L was shown to directly interact with the N terminus of TAP, whereas an HDAg-L mutant lacking the NLS failed to interact with full-length TAP. In addition, small hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of TAP or Aly reduced nuclear export of HDAg-L and assembly of HDV virions. Furthermore, a peptide, TAT-HDAg-L(198-210), containing the 10-amino acid TAT peptide and HDAg-L(198-210), inhibited the interaction between HDAg-L and TAP and blocked HDV virion assembly and secretion.

Kinase suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR1) binds each of the three ERK cascade components to facilitate pathway activation. Even though KSR1 contains a C-terminal kinase domain, evidence supporting the catalytic function of KSR1 remains controversial. In this study, we produced recombinant wild-type or kinase-inactive (D683A/D700A) KSR1 proteins in Escherichia coli to test the hypothesis that KSR1 is a functional protein kinase. Recombinant wild-type KSR1, but not recombinant kinase-inactive KSR1, underwent autophosphorylation on serine residue(s), phosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP) as a generic substrate, and phosphorylated recombinant kinase-inactive MAPK/ERK kinase-1 (MEK1). Furthermore, FLAG immunoprecipitates from KSR1(-/-) colon epithelial cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type KSR1 (+KSR1), but not vector (+vector) or FLAG-tagged kinase-inactive KSR1 (+D683A/D700A), were able to phosphorylate kinase-inactive MEK1. Since TNF activates the ERK pathway in colon epithelial cells, we tested the biological effects of KSR1 in the survival response downstream of TNF. We found that +vector and +D683A/D700A cells underwent apoptosis when treated with TNF, whereas +KSR1 cells were resistant. However, +KSR1 cells were sensitized to TNF-induced cell loss in the absence of MEK kinase activity. These data provide clear evidence that KSR1 is a functional protein kinase, MEK1 is an in vitro substrate of KSR1, and the catalytic activities of both proteins are required for eliciting cell survival responses downstream of TNF.",

Hexim1 binds directly to Cyclin T1 of P-TEFb with its coiled coil domain that is subdivided into a highly polar N-terminal segment containing nonconservative residues in the dimer interface and a C-terminal segment with an evolutionarily conserved sequence composition. Here we show that the noncanonical sequence composition of the first coiled coil segment is required for the interaction with Cyclin T1 while the second segment keeps the Cyclin T-binding domain dimeric upon binding. Both coiled coil segments exhibit distinct melting points as shown by heat denaturation experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Deletion of the central stammer motif (Delta316-318) leads to a single denaturation reaction, suggesting formation of a continuous coiled coil. Mutation of noncanonical coiled coil residues K284 and Y291 to valines in the dimer interface of the first segment only slightly increases its stability. Concomitantly, deletion of the stammer but not the double point mutation led to a reduced affinity for Cyclin T1 as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry. Moreover, Cyclin T1 bound Hexim1 with a 1:2 stoichiometry, whereas truncation of the C-terminal coiled coil led to formation of an equimolar complex. These observations suggest that binding to Cyclin T1 induces an asymmetry or sterical hindrance in the first coiled coil segment of dimeric Hexim1 that disallows formation of a 2:2 complex as further supported by analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking experiments.",

The objective of this report was to investigate the role of cyclin D3 in the biology of ICP0. We report the following results. (i) Wild-type ICP0 activates cyclin D-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) and stabilizes cyclin D1 although ICP0 does not interact with this cyclin. (ii) The D199A mutant virus (R7914) does not activate cdk4 or stabilize cyclin D1, and neither the wild-type nor the mutant virus activates cdk2. (iii) Early in infection of human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts both wild-type and D199A mutant ICP0s colocalize with PML, and in these cells the ND10 nuclear structures are dispersed. Whereas wild-type ICP0 is transported to the cytoplasm between 3 and 9 h. after infection, ICPO containing the D199A substitution remains quantitatively in the nucleus. (iv) To examine the interaction of ICP0 with cyclin D3, we used a previously described mutant carrying a wild-type ICP0 but expressing cyclin D3 (R7801) and in addition constructed a virus (R7916) that was identical except that it carried the D199A-substituted ICP0. Early in infection with R7801, ICP0 colocalized with cyclin D3 in structures similar to those containing PML. At 3 h after infection, ICP0 was translocated to the cytoplasm whereas cyclin D3 remained in the nucleus. The translocation of ICP0 to the cytoplasm was accelerated in cells expressing cyclin D3 compared with that of ICP0 expressed by wild-type virus. In contrast, ICP0 carrying the D199A substitution remained in the nucleus and did not colocalize with cyclin D3. These studies suggest the following conclusions. (i) ICP0 brings to the vicinity of ND10 cyclin D3 and, in consequence, an activated cdk4. The metabolic events occurring at or near that structure and involving cyclin D3 cause the translocation of ICP0 to the cytoplasm. (ii) In the absence of the cyclin D3 binding site in ICP0, cyclin D3 is not brought to ND10, cyclin D is not stabilized, and the function responsible for the translocation of ICP0 is not expressed, and in quiescent HEL fibroblasts the yields of virus are reduced.",

A high calcium concentration leading to the disruption of the protein interaction with protein phosphatase 2A explains CaMKIV activation in these conditions. Transcrip tionally active phosphorylated CREB was also found in a rho0 143B human osteosarcoma cell line and in a MERRF cybrid cell line mutated for tRNA(Lys) (A8344G).

Several of these kinases are oncogenic, and may function in the development of prostate cancer. One of the novel kinases is a new member of the sterile 20 (STE20) family of serine-threonine kinases which we have called prostate-derived STE20-like kinase (PSK) and characterized functionally. PSK encodes an open reading frame of 3705 nucleotides and contains an N-terminal kinase domain. Immunoprecipitated PSK phosphorylates myelin basic protein and transfected PSK stimulates MKK4 and MKK7 and activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Microinjection of PSK into cells results in localization of PSK to a vesicular compartment and causes a marked reduction in actin stress fibers. In contrast, C-terminally truncated PSK (1-349) did not localize to this compartment or induce a decrease in stress fibers demonstrating a requirement for the C terminus. Kinase-defective PSK (K57A) was unable to reduce stress fibers. PSK is the first member of the STE20 family lacking a Cdc42/Rac binding domain that has been shown to regulate both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the actin cytoskeleton.",

Coimmunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies demonstrated a specific association of E242X with full-length V2-Rs even in the presence of missense mutations. Systematic analysis of the structural requirements for the observed receptor/fragment association showed that N-terminal fragments containing at least transmembrane regions 1-3 interact with the full-length V2-R. Despite this specific interaction, no functional reconstitution was achieved for mutant V2-Rs following coexpression with E242X and Y280C. However, functional activity of R137H and R181C upon coexpression with E242X was regained by mutational disruption of the extracellular disulfide bond, which is highly conserved among GPCRs. Our data with the V2-R are consistent with a structural model in which class I GPCRs form contact oligomers by lateral interaction rather than by a domain-swapping mechanism.",

NPY-stimulated hemagglutinin-tagged Y1, Y1T361*, and Y1S352* receptors all efficiently activated G proteins in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes, but desensitization after NPY pretreatment was only prevented in the HAY1S352* clone. In transfected colonic carcinoma epithelial layers, functional Y1 and Y1T361* peptide YY responses became more transient as the agonist concentration increased, whereas those mediated by the Y1S352* receptor remained sustained. NPY-stimulated HAY1 receptor phosphorylation was increased by transient overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, and only Ser352stop truncation abolished this response in CHO or human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Rapid internalization of cell-surface HAY1 receptors in HEK293 cells was observed in response to agonist, resulting in partial colocalization with transferrin, a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recycling. It is surprising that both truncated receptors were constitutively internalized, predominantly in transferrin-positive compartments. NPY increased cell-surface localization of HAY1S352* receptors, whereas the distribution of both mutants was unaltered by BIBO3304. Recruitment of green fluorescent protein-tagged beta-arrestin2 to punctate endosomes was observed only for HAY1 and HAY1T361* receptors and solely under NPY-stimulated conditions. Thus, the key C-terminal sequence between Ser352 and Lys360 is a major site for Y1 receptor phosphorylation, is critical for its desensitization, and contributes to the association between the receptor and beta-arrestin proteins. However, additional beta-arrestin-independent mechanisms control Y1 receptor trafficking under basal conditions.",

Its disruption in mice entails a broad defect in renal endocytosis and causes secondary changes in calciotropic hormone levels. Inactivating mutations in Dent's disease lead to proteinuria and kidney stones. Possibly by recycling, a small fraction of ClC-5 also reaches the plasma membrane. Here we identify a carboxyl-terminal internalization motif in ClC-5. It resembles the PY motif, which is crucial for the endocytosis and degradation of epithelial Na(+) channels. Mutating this motif increases surface expression and currents about 2-fold. This is probably because of interactions with WW domains, because dominant negative mutants of the ubiquitin-protein ligase WWP2 increased surface expression and currents of ClC-5 only when its PY motif was intact. Stimulating endocytosis by expressing rab5 or its GTPase-deficient Q79L mutant decreased WT ClC-5 currents but did not affect channels with mutated motifs. Similarly, decreasing endocytosis by expressing the inactive S34N mutant of rab5 increased ClC-5 currents only if its PY-like motif was intact. Thus, the endocytosis of ClC-5, which itself is crucial for the endocytosis of other proteins, depends on the interaction of a carboxyl-terminal internalization signal with ubiquitin-protein ligases containing WW domains.",

Best known is the effect of p53 on Mdm2 transcription and the capacity of Mdm2 to target p53 for degradation, but more recently the role of Mdm2 as a positive regulator of p53 activity has also started to emerge. Mdm2 stimulates p53 mRNA translation by binding the p53 mRNA and, interestingly, this interaction also suppresses Mdm2's capacity to promote p53 polyubiquitination and degradation. Another interesting aspect of the p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interaction is that the p53 mRNA sequence encoding the amino acids which bind the N-terminus of Mdm2 is the same that interacts with the Mdm2 RING domain. Indeed, the regulatory elements for controlling Mdm2-dependent expression of p53 are derived from the same p53 genomic sequence. In addition, the RNA binding and the E3 ligase domain of Mdm2 overlap, indicati that the two functions of Mdm2 to control p53 synthesis and degradation have co-evolved in parallel in both p53 and Mdm2. Here we illustrate how the p53-Mdm2 protein-protein and p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interactions affect Mdm2-mediated control of p53 expression using the Phe19Ala p53 mutant. We discuss how the new insights into the regulation of p53 expression levels can help to shed light on the origin of this elegant feedback system and on the function of Mdm2 isoforms.",

The requirement for Cat-1 when assaying the anchorage-independent growth of transformed fibroblasts and HeLa cells is dependent on its ability to bind paxillin, while being negatively impacted by its Arf-GAP activity. Moreover, the co-expression of Cat-1 and an activated form of Arf6 in fibroblasts was sufficient to induce their transformation.

In addition, activation of p53 in patient with PD has been reported by several studies. Because phosphorylation of p53 is critical for regulating its activity and LRRK2 is a kinase, we tested whether p53 is phosphorylated by LRRK2. RESULTS: LRRK2 phosphorylates threonine (Thr) at TXR sites in an in vitro kinase assay, and the T304 and T377 were identified as putative phosphorylated residues. An increase of phospho-Thr in the p53 TXR motif was confirmed in the cells overexpressing G2019S, and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of a G2019S carrier. Interactions between LRRK2 and p53 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of lysates of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. LRRK2 mediated p53 phosphorylation translocalizes p53 predominantly to nucleus and increases p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in SH-SY5Y cells based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay results. The luciferase assay using the p21(WAF1/CIP1) promoter-reporter also confirmed that LRRK2 kinase activity increases p21 expression. Exogenous expression of G2019S and the phosphomimetic p53 T304/377D mutants increased expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and cleaved PARP, and cytotoxicity in the same cells. We also observed increase of p21 expression in rat primary neuron cells after transient expression of p53 T304/377D mutants and the mid-brain lysates of the G2019S transgenic mice. CONCLUSION: p53 is a LRRK2 kinase substrate. Phosphorylation of p53 by LRRK2 induces p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression and apoptosis in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary neurons.",

Two of these sites (tyrosines 951 and 996) are located in the receptor's kinase insert domain, and two (tyrosines 1054 and 1059) are located in the catalytic domain. In order to clarify the functional significance of these sites, we made DNA constructs in which tyrosine codons were replaced with those for phenylalanine, and expressed the DNA constructs in 293 cells. VEGF binding to cells expressing the native receptor led to a rapid increase in receptor and PLC-gamma phosphorylation, and a slower increase in the phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin. VEGF binding to KDR(Y951F) and KDR(Y996F) expressing cells resulted in phosphorylation of all cellular substrates tested, although the level of PLCgamma phosphorylation was decreased for KDR(Y996F). The decreased level of PLCgamma phosphorylation was not because PLCgamma-containing SH2 domains bind to the Y996 autophosphorylation site. We conclude that there exists receptor autophosphorylation sites not previously identified which allow for signaling via PLCgamma, as well as p125FAK and paxillin. VEGF binding to cells expressing KDR mutated at both tyrosine's 1054 and 1059 activated receptor autophosphorylation but at a level which was only 10% of that seen for cells expressing native receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cell signaling proteins was not observed in KDR(Y1054,1059) expressing cells. Utilizing an in vitro assay which directly measures receptor catalytic activity allowed us to determine that the tyrosine kinase activity of the native receptor was significantly greater than that for the double mutant. We conclude from this result that VEGF-induced autophosphorylation at tyrosines 1054 and 1059 is a required step for allowing maximal KDR kinase activity. Maximal rates of receptor kinase activity is required for VEGF-induced receptor internalization, as internalization was delayed in the KDR(Y1054,1059F) expressing cells when compared to cells expressing native receptor.",

The patient (W.K.) showed the classic bleeding symptoms together with absence of platelet agglutination to restocetin plus von Willebrand factor, whereas aggregation to ADP, collagen, and arachidonic acid was normal. Platelets were markedly larger than normal and the patient had life-long thrombocytopenia. Surface-labeling of the platelets and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed reduced but detectable amounts of glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V present;however, there was markedly less GPIX (2% +/- 1% of normal) than GPIb alpha, Ib beta, or V (7% +/- 2% of normal). This disproportion was confirmed by Western blotting. Sequence analysis was performed after polymerase chain reaction amplification of the coding region of the GPIX and GPI b alpha genes from the patient. A point mutation (A-->G) was found in GPIX converting 45Asn to Ser within the leucine-rich domain. No mutations were found in GPIb alpha. Both alleles of GPIX contained the same defect, which was confirmed by the appearance of a new cleavage site for the restriction enzyme Fnu4HI. This substitution did not affect glycosylation at the neighboring 44Asn as judged by the distribution on two-dimensional gels but did appear to change the conformation of the leucine-rich domain, thus reducing surface expression of the complex. The relationship between GPIb and GPV was not affected, indicating that GPIX does not regulate this. This homozygous mutation in GPIX indicates that, among other possible functions, the leucine-rich domains present on all components of GPIb-IX-V may play a role in the assembly and surface expression of the complex.",

Here we found that MORC3 (microrchidia3)-ATPase activated p53 and induced cellular senescence in normal human and mouse fibroblasts but not p53-/- fibroblasts. Conversely, genotoxic stress-induced phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 but barely increased its transcriptional activity in Morc3-/- fibroblasts.

In this report, we demonstrate that human MLH1 is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 at Asp(418) in vitro. Furthermore, MLH1 is rapidly proteolyzed by caspase-3 in cancer cells induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, which damages DNA. Importantly, proteolysis of MLH1 by caspase-3 triggers its partial redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and generates a proapoptotic carboxyl-terminal product. In addition, we demonstrate that a caspase-3 cleavage-resistant D418E MLH1 mutant inhibits etoposide-induced apoptosis but has little effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the proteolysis of MLH1 by caspase-3 plays a functionally important and previously unrecognized role in the execution of DNA damage-induced apoptosis.",

We show that the phosphorylated CagA binds Crk adaptor proteins (Crk-II, Crk-I, and Crk-L) and that the interaction is important for the CagA-mediated host responses during H. pylori infection. H. pylori-induced scattering of gastric epithelial cells in culture was blocked by overexpression of dominant-negative Crk and by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous Crk. H. pylori infection of the gastric epithelium induced disruption of E-cadherin/catenin-containing adherens junctions, which was also dependent on CagA/Crk signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of the SoS1/H-Ras/Raf1, C3G/Rap1/B-Raf, or Dock180/Rac1/Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin homologous protein pathway, all of which are involved downstream of Crk adaptors, greatly diminished the CagA-associated host responses.

Engagement of the IL-7R activates the intracellular enzyme phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase but the mechanism of PtdIns 3-kinase activation and the molecular basis of its interaction with IL-7R are not known. Here we show that IL-7 causes the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase (p85), and PtdIns 3-kinase activity, to associate with the IL-7R. This interaction can be ascribed to ligand-induced phosphorylation of a single Tyr residue in the receptor's unique alpha chain. Herbimycin A, a specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppresses not only tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-7R but also its association with p85. A phosphopeptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr449 in the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-7R alpha chain, but not its non-phosphorylated analogue or phosphopeptides coincident with the sequences surrounding other alpha chain Tyr residues, efficiently competes out p85 binding. Replacement of Tyr449 with Phe results in a loss of p85 binding. Finally, soluble forms of the src homology 2 domains of p85, which bind directly to phosphotyrosyl peptides, specifically inhibit the association of p85 with the IL-7R. Thus, PtdIns 3-kinase recruitment occurs through a single, phosphotyrosine dependent recognition motif surrounding Tyr449 in the IL-7R alpha chain. This motif corresponds to a canonical sequence for p85 binding, Tyr(P)-X-X-Met. Since the closely related IL-2R and IL-4R also activate PtdIns 3-kinase but are devoid of such canonical motifs, our results suggest that the mechanism by which IL-7R recruits and activates PtdIns 3-kinase differs fundamentally from that used by the other receptors. PtdIns 3-kinase may, therefore, play a unique and important role in the biological response to IL-7.",

In addition, the treatment of cells expressing the EGFr with phorbol esters has been shown to cause a loss of the high-affinity binding capacity of the receptor. In the present study, point mutations that alter acidic or phosphorylation sites have been made in an intracellular domain near Tyr-992 (residues 988-992) of the EGFr. Equilibrium (125)I-EGF binding studies demonstrate that the conversion of Tyr-992 into glutamate induces a 4-fold decrease in the EGFr apparent low-affinity dissociation constant, whereas the mutation of two acidic residues, Asp-988 and Glu-991, or the conversion of Tyr-992 into phenylalanine does not alter EGFr affinity. Phorbol ester treatment of EGFr-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells results in a loss of high-affinity binding and an increase in the apparent low-affinity dissociation constant of the receptor, similar to the effect of a truncation mutant in which the C-terminal 190 residues are deleted. These results are examined in the context of a new model for regulation of the affinity of the EGFr for EGF in which a cytosolic particle stabilizes the high-affinity conformation of the EGFr and a rapid equilibrium exists between EGFr high-affinity and low-affinity conformations. This model demonstrates that the macroscopic affinities of the EGFr can differ from the affinities of individual EGFr molecules and provides a theoretical framework whereby the measured affinities of the EGFr are modulated by intracellular interactions.",

The interaction of the MBP-gpJ chimera protein with reconstituted LamB and its mutants LamB Y118G and the loop deletion mutant LamB Delta4+Delta6+Delta9v was studied using planar lipid bilayer membranes on a single-channel and multichannel level. Titration with the MBP-gpJ chimera blocked completely the ion current through reconstituted LamB when it was added to the cis side, the extracellular side of LamB with a half-saturation constant of approximately 6 nM in 1 M KCl. Control experiments with LamB Delta4+Delta6+Delta9v from which all major external loops had been removed showed similar blocking, whereas MBP alone caused no visible effect. Direct conductance measurement with His(6)-gpJ that contained a hexahistidyl tag (His(6) tag) at the N-terminal end of the protein for easy purification revealed no blocking of the ion current, requiring other measurements for the binding constant. However, when maltoporin was preincubated with His-gpJ, MBP-gpJ could not block the channel, which indicated that also His(6)-gpJ bound to the channel.

We investigated the mechanism by which TS-bound IAP modulates the affinity of platelet integrin, alphaIIbbeta3. Platelet aggregation induced by 4N1K was not completely inhibited by energy depletion with sodium azide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose, although ADP or collagen-induced platelet response was completely inhibited. The binding of ligand-mimetic antibody PAC1 to alphaIIbbeta3 was also induced in the energy-depleted platelets. In the transfected Namalwa cells, 4N1K induced activation of the alphaIIbbeta3 with mutated beta3 (Ser-752 to Pro), which is a non-responsive form to inside-out signaling, as well as wild type alphaIIbbeta3. The truncated form of IAP with only the extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain was sufficient for the activation of alphaIIbbeta3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, although the IAP-mediated intracellular signaling was abolished, which was monitored by the absence of down-regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, the soluble recombinant Ig domain of IAP induced PAC1 binding to alphaIIbbeta3 on Chinese hamster ovary cells when added with 4N1K. Physical association between the soluble recombinant Ig domain of IAP and purified alphaIIbbeta3 was detected in the presence of 4N1K. These data indicate that the extracellular Ig domain of IAP, when bound to TS, interacts with alphaIIbbeta3 and can change alphaIIbbeta3 in a high affinity state without the requirement of intracellular signaling.

Here we demonstrate a novel signaling mechanism wherein beta-arrestins mediate beta2AR signaling to extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK 1/2) independent of G protein activation. Activation of ERK1/2 by the beta2AR expressed in HEK-293 cells was resolved into two components dependent, respectively, on G(s)-G(i)/protein kinase A (PKA) or beta-arrestins. G protein-dependent activity was rapid, peaking within 2-5 min, was quite transient, was blocked by pertussis toxin (G(i) inhibitor) and H-89 (PKA inhibitor), and was insensitive to depletion of endogenous beta-arrestins by siRNA. beta-Arrestin-dependent activation was slower in onset (peak 5-10 min), less robust, but more sustained and showed little decrement over 30 min. It was insensitive to pertussis toxin and H-89 and sensitive to depletion of either beta-arrestin1 or -2 by small interfering RNA. In G(s) knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wild-type beta2AR recruited beta-arrestin2-green fluorescent protein and activated pertussis toxin-insensitive ERK1/2. Furthermore, a novel beta2AR mutant (beta2AR(T68F,Y132G,Y219A) or beta2AR(TYY)), rationally designed based on Evolutionary Trace analysis, was incapable of G protein activation but could recruit beta-arrestins, undergo beta-arrestin-dependent internalization, and activate beta-arrestin-dependent ERK. Interestingly, overexpression of GRK5 or -6 increased mutant receptor phosphorylation and beta-arrestin recruitment, led to the formation of stable receptor-beta-arrestin complexes on endosomes, and increased agonist-stimulated phospho-ERK1/2. In contrast, GRK2, membrane translocation of which requires Gbetagamma release upon G protein activation, was ineffective unless it was constitutively targeted to the plasma membrane by a prenylation signal (CAAX). These findings demonstrate that the beta2AR can signal to ERK via a GRK5/6-beta-arrestin-dependent pathway, which is independent of G protein coupling.",

          "text": "Frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD) is a progressive sclerosing skeletal dysplasia affecting the long bones and skull. The cause of FMD in some individuals is gain-of-function mutations in FLNA, although how these mutations result in a hyperostotic phenotype remains unknown. Approximately one half of individuals with FMD have no identified mutation in FLNA and are phenotypically very similar to individuals with FLNA mutations, except for an increased tendency to form keloid scars. Using whole-exome sequencing and targeted Sanger sequencing in 19 FMD-affected individuals with no identifiable FLNA mutation, we identified mutations in two genes-MAP3K7, encoding transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-activated kinase (TAK1), and TAB2, encoding TAK1-associated binding protein 2 (TAB2). Four mutations were found in MAP3K7, including one highly recurrent (n = 15) de novo mutation (c.1454C>T [ p.Pro485Leu]) proximal to the coiled-coil domain of TAK1 and three missense mutations affecting the kinase domain (c.208G>C [p.Glu70Gln], c.299T>A [p.Val100Glu], and c.502G>C [p.Gly168Arg]). Notably, the subjects with the latter three mutations had a milder FMD phenotype. An additional de novo mutation was found in TAB2 (c.1705G>A, p.Glu569Lys). The recurrent mutation does not destabilize TAK1, or impair its ability to homodimerize or bind TAB2, but it does increase TAK1 autophosphorylation and alter the activity of more than one signaling pathway regulated by the TAK1 kinase complex. These findings show that dysregulation of the TAK1 complex produces a close phenocopy of FMD caused by FLNA mutations. Furthermore, they suggest that the pathogenesis of some of the filaminopathies caused by FLNA mutations might be mediated by misregulation of signaling coordinated through the TAK1 signaling complex.",

HMGR is anchored in the ER via its N-terminal region, which spans the membrane eight times and contains a sterol-sensing domain. We have previously established that degradation of mammalian HMGR is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Ravid, T., Doolman, R., Avner, R., Harats, D., and Roitelman, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35840-35847). Here we expressed in HEK-293 cells an HA-tagged-truncated version of HMGR that encompasses all eight transmembrane spans (350 N-terminal residues). Similar to endogenous HMGR, degradation of this HMG(350)-3HA protein was accelerated by sterols, validating it as a model to study HMGR turnover. The degradation of HMG(240)-3HA, which lacks the last two transmembrane spans yet retains an intact sterol-sensing domain, was no longer accelerated by sterols. Using HMG(350)-3HA, we demonstrate that transmembrane region of HMGR is ubiquitinated in a sterol-regulated fashion. Through site-directed Lys --> Arg mutagenesis, we pinpoint Lys(248) and Lys(89) as the internal lysines for ubiquitin attachment, with Lys(248) serving as the major acceptor site for polyubiquitination. Moreover, the data indicate that the N terminus is also ubiquitinated. The degradation rates of the Lys --> Arg mutants correlates with their level of ubiquitination. Notably, lysine-less HMG(350)-3HA is degraded faster than wild-type protein, suggesting that lysines other than Lys(89) and Lys(248) attenuate ubiquitination at the latter residues. The ATP-dependent ubiquitination of HMGR in isolated microsomes requires E1 as the sole cytosolic protein, indicating that ER-bound E2 and E3 enzymes catalyze this modification. Polyubiquitination of HMGR is correlated with its extraction from the ER membrane, a process likely to be assisted by cytosolic p97/VCP/Cdc48p-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, as only ubiquitinated HMGR pulls down p97.",

The synthesis of the bimetallic catalytic center requires a suite of accessory proteins, and the penultimate step, nickel insertion, is facilitated by the metallochaperones HypA and HypB. In Escherichia coli, nickel moves from a site in the GTPase domain of HypB to HypA in a process accelerated by GDP. To determine how the transfer of nickel is controlled, the impacts of HypA and nucleotides on the properties of HypB were examined. Integral to this work was His2Gln HypA, a mutant with attenuated nickel affinity that does not support hydrogenase production in E. coli. This mutation inhibits the translocation of nickel from HypB. H2Q-HypA does not modulate the apparent metal affinity of HypB, but the stoichiometry and stability of the HypB-nickel complex are modulated by the nucleotide. Furthermore, the HypA-HypB interaction was detected by gel filtration chromatography if HypB was loaded with GDP, but not a GTP analogue, and the protein complex dissociated upon binding of nickel to His2 of HypA. In contrast, a nucleotide does not modulate the binding of zinc to HypB, and loading zinc into the GTPase domain of HypB inhibits formation of the complex with HypA. These results demonstrate that GTP hydrolysis controls both metal binding and protein-protein interactions, conferring selective and directional nickel transfer during [NiFe]-hydrogenase biosynthesis.",

Here we describe a mechanism by which ptc1-Q688X causes constitutive cellular signaling. Cells expressing ptc1-Q688X demonstrate an increase in cell cycle progression and induce cell transformation. The ptc1-Q688X mutant enhances Gli1 activity, a downstream reporter of sonic hedgehog (shh)-ptc1 signaling, independent of shh stimulation. In contrast to wild-type ptc1, ptc1-Q688X fails to associate with endogenous cyclin B1. Expression of nuclear-targeted cyclin B1 derivatives promotes Gli1-dependent transcription, which correlates temporally with cyclin B1-cdk1 kinase activity. Coexpression of wild-type ptc1 with a nuclear-targeted cyclin B1 derivative, mutated to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, dramatically decreases Gli1 activity. In addition, the coexpression of this constitutively nuclear cyclin B1 derivative with ptc1-Q688X substantially enhances foci formation. These studies therefore describe a molecular mechanism for the aberrant activity of ptc1-Q688X that includes the premature activation of the transcription factor Gli1.",

Although PDK1 phosphorylates and activates PKC, PKB, and RSK in vivo, PDK1 regulation of PKA remains controversial. We isolated ksg1, the fission yeast ortholog of mammalian PDK1, as a suppressor of growth defects caused by loss of the stress-activated MAP kinase, Spc1. Here, we demonstrate that Ksg1 is required for activation of PKA. Cells containing the ksg1.12 thermolabile allele exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes, including the failure to arrest in G(1) and an inability to conjugate. The ksg1.12 allele strongly suppresses defects associated with unregulated PKA. Pka1, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, is phosphorylated in vivo at Thr-356, which is located in the activation loop of the kinase and corresponds to Thr-197 in mammalian PKA. Phosphorylation of Thr-356 is required for in vivo activation of Pka1 and is dependent upon Ksg1. These data provide experimental evidence that PKA is a physiological substrate for PDK1.",

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen and a GST in vitro transcription and translation assay, the mismatch repair (MMR) protein Mlh1p was demonstrated to interact physically with Ntg2p. The Mlh1p binding site maps to amino acids residues 15-40 of Ntg2p. The Ntg2p binding site is localized in the C-terminal end (483-769) of Mlh1p. Overproduction of Ntg2p results in a mutator phenotype with enhanced frameshift reversion frequency, suggesting partial inhibition of the MMR pathway. In contrast, inactivation of NTG2 does not enhance mutagenesis, indicating that Ntg2p is not required for MMR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mlh1p binding domain of Ntg2p revealed three amino acids (Ser(24), Tyr(26), Phe(27)) that are absolutely required for Ntg2p-Mlh1p interaction. These residues are part of a motif found in Ntg2p (Arg(23)-Ser(24)-Lys(25)-Tyr(26)-Phe(27)), Exo1p (Arg(444)-Ser(445)-Lys(446)-Phe(447)-Phe(448)), and Sgs1p (Lys(1383)-Ser(1384)-Lys(1385)-Phe(1386)-Phe(1387)).

Furthermore, S445A, F447A, and F448A mutants of Exo1p do not bind Mlh1p, but the wild type Exo1p does. Therefore, we propose that the R/K-S-R/K-Y/F-Y/F sequence could define a Mhl1 binding motif.

Some pro-BDNF is released extracellularly and is biologically active as demonstrated by its ability to mediate TrkB phosphorylation. The precursor undergoes N-terminal cleavage within the trans-Golgi network and/or immature secretory vesicles to generate mature BDNF (14 kDa). Small amounts of a 28-kDa protein that is immunoprecipitated with BDNF antibodies is also evident. This protein is generated in the endoplasmic reticulum through N-terminal cleavage of pro-BDNF at the Arg-Gly-Leu-Thr(57)- downward arrow-Ser-Leu site. Cleavage is abolished when Arg(54) is changed to Ala (R54A) by in vitro mutagenesis. Blocking generation of 28-kDa BDNF has no effect on the level of mature BDNF and blocking generation of mature BDNF with alpha(1)-PDX, an inhibitor of furin-like enzymes, does not lead to accumulation of the 28-kDa form.

The SH2 domain (which can be further divided into the B and C homology boxes) and the SH3 domain (also referred to as the A box) are also found in several proteins otherwise unrelated to protein tyrosine kinases. It is believed that these domains are important for directing specific protein-protein interactions necessary for the proper functioning of Src. To determine the importance of the SH2 and SH3 domains in regulating the functions of c-Src, we evaluated mutants of c-Src lacking the A box (residues 88 to 137), the B box (residues 148 to 187) or the C box (residues 220 to 231). Each of these deletions caused a 14- to 30-fold increase in the in vitro level of kinase activity of c-Src. Chicken embryo fibroblasts expressing the deletion mutants displayed a transformed cell morphology, formed colonies in soft agar, and contained elevated levels of cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Src substrates p36, p85, p120, p125, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and several GAP-associated proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells expressing the A, B, or C box deletion mutant. p110 was highly phosphorylated in cells expressing the C box mutant, was weakly phosphorylated in cells expressing the B box mutant, and was not phosphorylated in cells expressing the A box mutant. Expression of the mutant proteins caused a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton similar to that seen in v-Src-transformed cells. In addition, deletion of the A, B, or C box did not diminish the transforming or enzymatic activity of an activated variant of c-Src, E378G. These data indicate that deletion of the A, B, or C homology box causes an activation of the catalytic and transforming potential of c-Src and that while these mutations caused subtle differences in substrate phosphorylation, the homology boxes are not required for many of the phenotypic changes associated with transformation by Src.",

The underlying mechanisms of how the activated FGFR3 causes TDII remains to be elucidated. FGFR3 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is synthesized through three isoforms, with various degrees of N-glycosylation. We have studied whether immature FGFR3 isoforms mediate the abnormal signaling in TDII. We show that synthesis of TDII-FGFR3 presents two phosphorylated forms: the immature non-glycosylated 98-kDa peptides and the intermediate 120-kDa glycomers. The mature, fully glycosylated 130-kDa forms, detected in wild type FGFR3, are not present in TDII. Endoglycosidase H cleaves the sugars on TDII intermediates thus indicating their intracellular localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, TDII-FGFR3-GFP co-localizes with calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, following TDII transfection, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is phosphorylated in the absence of FGFR3 ligand and brefeldin A does not inhibit its activation. On the contrary, the cell membrane-anchored FRS2alpha protein is not activated in TDII cells. The opposite situation is observed in stable TDII cell clones where, despite the presence of phosphorylated mature receptor, STAT1 is not activated whereas FRS2alpha is phosphorylated. We speculate that the selection process favors cells defective in STAT1 activation through the 120-kDa TDII-FGFR3, thus allowing growth of the TDII cell clones. Accordingly, apoptosis is observed following TDII-FGFR3 transfection. These observations highlight the importance of the immature TDII-FGFR3 proteins as mediators of an abnormal signaling in TDII.",

AKAP149 plays an important role in controlling the subcellular localization and temporal specificity of protein phosphorylation and mRNA metabolism by tethering kinases and phosphatases, such as protein kinase A and type I protein phosphatase, through its N-terminal protein-binding motifs and mRNAs via its C-terminal RNA-binding motifs. It is well recognized that caspases play a central role in transducing and amplifying the intracellular death signal and that apoptosis is executed as a consequence of caspase-mediated cleavage of multiple cellular substrates. The identification of novel death substrates and elucidation of the consequences of their proteolytic cleavages by caspases are therefore crucial for our understanding of cell death and other biological processes. Herein, we demonstrated that AKAP149 is a direct substrate of active caspase-3, -8 -and -10 in vitro and in vivo. 35S-labeled full-length AKAP149 was completely cleaved in vitro by active caspase-3, -8 and -10 into two fragments of approximately 105 and 45 kDa, while caspase-2 cleaved it partially and caspase-1 did not cleave it at all. AKAP149 was also cleaved by caspases during Fas- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T and HeLa cells, which were blocked by specific inhibitors of caspase-3 and -8. The specific cleavage site for these caspases was mapped in vitro and in vivo to Asp582 at AKAP149, which is located between the protein kinase A regulatory subunit anchoring and KH RNA-binding domains. In addition, HeLa cells transiently overexpressing AKAP149 D582E mutant were resistant to staurosporine-induced HeLa cell apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that AKAP149 activity may be deregulated by caspase-dependent proteolysis during apoptotic cell death and may provide useful information for elucidating the apoptosis signaling pathways in detail.",

Two missense mutations in the C-terminal domain of Smad4, D351H (Asp351-->His) and D537Y (Asp537-->Tyr), have been described recently in the human colorectal cancer cell lines CACO-2 and SW948 respectively [Woodford-Richens, Rowan, Gorman, Halford, Bicknell, Wasan, Roylance, Bodmer and Tomlinson (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 9719-9723]. Previous work in vitro suggested that only Asp-351 was required for interaction with Smad2 [Wu, Fairman, Penry and Shi (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 20688-20694]. In the present study, we investigate the functional consequences of these point mutations in vivo. We demonstrate that neither of these colorectal cancer cells undergo growth arrest in response to TGF-beta, which can be explained, at least in part, by their inability to up-regulate cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 (CIP1 ) or p15 ( INK4b) after TGF-beta stimulation. Although the point-mutated Smad4s are expressed at normal levels in these colorectal cancer cells, they cannot interact with either TGF-beta-induced phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3. As a result, these Smad4 mutants do not accumulate in the nucleus after TGF-beta stimulation, are not recruited to DNA by relevant Smad-binding transcription factors and cannot generate transcriptionally active DNA-bound complexes. Therefore both these colorectal tumour cells completely lack functional Smad4 activity owing to the missense mutations. Given the location of these mutations in the three-dimensional structure of the Smad4 C-terminal domain, the results also give us significant insights into Smad complex formation.",

The insulin resistance induced by TNF-alpha is antagonized by thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a new class of insulin-sensitizing drugs. The aim of the current study was to dissect the mechanism whereby pioglitazone, one of the TZDs, ameliorates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pioglitazone restored insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (DOG) uptake, which was reduced by TNF-alpha, with concomitant restorations in tyrosine phosphorylation and protein levels of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, as well as association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase activity. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of either wild-type human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma2 or a mutant carrying a replacement at the consensus mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site (hPPAR-gamma2-S112A) promoted adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and restored TNF-alpha-induced decrease of triglyceride in adipocytes as effectively as pioglitazone. Overexpression of the PPAR-gamma proteins in TNF-alpha-treated adipocytes restored protein levels of IR/IRS-1, but did not improve insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR/IRS-1 or insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake. These results indicate that the ability of pioglitazone to restore insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR/IRS-1, which is necessary for amelioration of TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance, may be independent of the adipogenic activity of PPAR-gamma that regulates protein levels of IR/IRS-1.",

Sufu is a binding partner of Shh pathway transcription factor Gli. Recent data indicate that inactivation of Sufu, through either gene targeting in mice or RNAi-mediated silencing in cultured fibroblasts, is sufficient to turn on Shh target gene expression. Here, we report that Sufu is degraded rapidly in certain cancer cells and we show that Shh signaling promotes ubiquitination of Sufu, which leads to its destruction in the proteasomes. We identified an ubiquitin attachment site on K257 of Sufu, and showed that Sufu-K257R mutant is more potent as a transcription repressor and cell growth inhibitor because of increased stability. These results indicate that Shh signaling regulates Sufu activity by inducing its turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",

Monomeric p53(361-393) protein (lacking the p53 tetramerization domain, amino acids 325-356) did not exhibit SCS binding while both dimeric mutant p53(319- 393)L344A and fusion protein GCN4-p53(347-393) were effective in SCS binding. Supershifting of p53(320-393)-scDNA complexes with monoclonal antibodies revealed that the amino acid region 375-378, constituting the epitope of the Bp53-10.1 antibody, plays a role in binding of the p53(320-393) protein to scDNA. Using electron microscopy we observed p53-scDNA nucleoprotein filaments produced by all the C-terminal proteins that displayed SCS binding in the gel electrophoresis experiments; no filaments formed with the monomeric p53(361- 393) protein. We propose a model according to which two DNA duplexes are compacted into p53-scDNA filaments and discuss a role for filament formation in recombination.",

One of the most highly conserved sequences is the NPXXY motif located at the cytosolic end of the transmembrane region-7 of many GPCRs, particularly of those belonging to the family of the rhodopsin/beta-adrenergic-like receptors. Exchange of Tyr(305) in the corresponding NPLVY sequence of the bradykinin B(2) receptor (B(2)R) for Ala resulted in a mutant, termed Y305A, that internalized [(3)H]bradykinin (BK) almost as rapidly as the wild-type (wt) B(2)R. However, receptor sequestration of the mutant after stimulation with BK was clearly reduced relative to the wt B(2)R. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that, in contrast to the B(2)R-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimera, the Y305A-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimera was predominantly located intracellularly even in the absence of BK. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis showed that the mutant Y305A constitutively exhibited a phosphorylation pattern similar to that of the BK-stimulated wt B(2)R. Ligand-independent Y305A internalization was demonstrated by the uptake of rhodamine-labeled antibodies directed to a tag sequence at the N terminus of the mutant receptor. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that Y305A is precoupled to G(q/11) without activating the G protein because the basal accumulation rate of inositol phosphate was unchanged as compared with wt B(2)R. We conclude, therefore, that the Y305A mutation of B(2)R induces a receptor conformation which is prone to ligand-independent phosphorylation and internalization. The mutated receptor binds to, but does not activate, its cognate heterotrimeric G protein G(q/11), thereby limiting the extent of ligand-independent receptor internalization.",

In the present study, we investigated the association between ALG-2 and ESCRT-I. By a GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assay using HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney 293T) cell lysates, endogenous TSG101 and two other exogenously expressed ESCRT-I components [hVps28 (human vacuolar protein sorting 28) and hVps37A] were shown to associate with GST-ALG-2 in the presence of Ca2+. By the yeast two-hybrid assay, however, a positive interaction was observed with only TSG101 among the three ESCRT-I components, suggesting that ALG-2 associates with hVps28 and hVps37A indirectly through TSG101. Using various deletion mutants of TSG101, the central PRR (proline-rich region) was found to be sufficient for interaction with ALG-2 by the GST-pull-down assay. Direct binding of ALG-2 to the TSG101 PRR was demonstrated by an overlay assay using biotin-labelled ALG-2 as a probe. In immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of HeLa cells that overexpressed a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-fused ATPase-defective dominant-negative form of SKD1/Vps4B (GFP-SKD1(E235Q)), ALG-2 exhibited a punctate distribution at the perinuclear area and co-localized with GFP-SKD1(E235Q) to aberrant endosomes. This punctate distribution of ALG-2 was markedly diminished by treatment of HeLa cells with a membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator. Moreover, a Ca2+-binding-defective mutant of ALG-2 did not co-localize with GFP-SKD1(E235Q). Our findings suggest that ALG-2 may function as a Ca2+-dependent accessory protein of the endosomal sorting machinery by interacting directly with TSG101 as well as with Alix.",

To explore a novel disease gene, we searched for obscurin gene (OBSCN) mutations in HCM patients, because obscurin interacts with titin/connectin. Two linked variants, Arg4344Gln and Ala4484Thr, were identified in a patient and functional analyses demonstrated that Arg4344Gln affected binding of obscurin to Z9-Z10 domains of titin/connectin, whereas Ala4484Thr did not.

Downregulation of HSP70 caused a CP-mediated defect associated with replication. When PVA CP was expressed in trans, it interfered with viral gene expression and replication-associated translation (RAT). However, CP produced in cis interfered specifically with RAT. CPIP binds to potyviral CP, and overexpression of CPIP was sufficient to restore RAT inhibited by expression of CP in trans. Restoration of RAT was dependent on the ability of CPIP to interact with HSP70 since expression of a J-domain mutant, CPIP(Delta66), had only a minor effect on RAT. CPIP-mediated delivery of CP to HSP70 promoted CP degradation by increasing its ubiquitination when assayed in the absence of virus infection.

Similar interactions were noted in other leukemia cells (HL-60, Raji, Jurkat) and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. Coadministration of L744832 blocked UCN-01-mediated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK), leading to down-regulation of phospho-cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element-binding protein (phospho-CREB) and -p90(RSK) and activation of p34(cdc2) and stress-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SEK/JNK). Combined treatment also resulted in pronounced reductions in levels of phospho-Akt, -glycogen synthase kinase-3 (-GSK-3), -p70(S6K), -mammalian target of rapamycin (-mTOR), -forkhead transcription factor (-FKHR), -caspase-9, and -Bad.

Finally, down-regulation of JNK1 by siRNA significantly reduced the lethality of the UCN-01/L744832 regimen. Together, these findings suggest that farnesyltransferase inhibitors interrupt the cytoprotective Akt and MAPK pathways while reciprocally activating SAPK/JNK in leukemia cells exposed to UCN-01 and, in so doing, dramatically increase mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.",

This study explores the effect of Parkin degradation, via the overexpression of nucleus accumbens 1 (NAC1), on cell viability. It was found that NAC1 and Parkin are co-localized within the cell and interact with one another, leading to a decrease in Parkin levels. Moreover, NAC1 down-regulates Parkin by presenting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation, which causes a decrease in proteasomal activity in neuronal cells. Consequently, this decrease in proteasomal activity leads to an increase in the cells' susceptibility to proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. It was also found that Parkin and NAC1 are key proteins found to be present mainly in the cytoplasm and are co-localized in neurons of Parkinson's disease patients. Interestingly, mutation in the POZ/BTB domain (Q23L) of NAC1 disrupts the co-localization and interaction of NAC1 with Parkin and it further abrogates the proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. We further observed that co-transfection of the mutant form of NAC1 with Parkin reversed the proteasome activity and 20S proteasome protein levels. These results indicate a novel interaction between NAC1 and Parkin that leads to neuronal cell death, a main characteristic in Parkinson's disease.",

However, AGM CCR5 is a weak coreceptor for tested macrophage-tropic (R5) isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Correspondingly, gp120 envelope glycoproteins derived from R5 isolates of HIV-1 bind poorly to AGM CCR5. We focused on a unique extracellular amino acid substitution at the juncture of transmembrane helix 4 (TM4) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (Arg for Gly at amino acid 163 (G163R)) as the likely source of the weak R5 gp120 binding and HIV-1 coreceptor properties of AGM CCR5. Accordingly, a G163R mutant of human CCR5 was severely attenuated in its ability to bind R5 gp120s and to mediate infection by R5 HIV-1 isolates. Conversely, the R163G mutant of AGM CCR5 was substantially strengthened as a coreceptor for HIV-1 and had improved R5 gp120 binding affinity relative to the wild-type AGM CCR5. These substitutions at amino acid position 163 had no effect on chemokine binding or signal transduction, suggesting the absence of structural alterations. The 2D7 monoclonal antibody has been reported to bind to ECL2 and to block HIV-1 binding and infection. Whereas 2D7 antibody binding to CCR5 was unaffected by the G163R mutation, it was prevented by a conservative ECL2 substitution (K171R), shared between rhesus and AGM CCR5s. Thus, it appears that the 2D7 antibody binds to an epitope that includes Lys-171 and may block HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 by occluding an HIV-1-binding site in the vicinity of Gly-163. In summary, our results identify a site for gp120 interaction that is critical for R5 isolates of HIV-1 in the central core of human CCR5, and we propose that this site collaborates with a previously identified region in the CCR5 amino terminus to enable gp120 binding and HIV-1 infections.",

PTEN has been implicated in autism for a subset of patients with macrocephaly. Various studies identified patients in this subclass with one normal and one mutated PTEN gene. We characterize the binding, structural properties, activity, and subcellular localization of one of these autism-related mutants, H93R PTEN. Even though this mutation is located at the phosphatase active site, we find that it affects the functions of neighboring domains. H93R PTEN binding to phosphatidylserine-bearing model membranes is 5.6-fold enhanced in comparison to wild-type PTEN. In contrast, we find that binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) model membranes is 2.5-fold decreased for the mutant PTEN in comparison to wild-type PTEN. The structural change previously found for wild-type PTEN upon interaction with PI(4,5)P(2), is absent for H93R PTEN. Consistent with the increased binding to phosphatidylserine, we find enhanced plasma membrane association of PTEN-GFP in U87MG cells. However, this enhanced plasma membrane association does not translate into increased PI(3,4,5)P(3) turnover, since in vivo studies show a reduced activity of the H93R PTEN-GFP mutant. Because the interaction of PI(4,5)P(2) with PTEN's N-terminal domain is diminished by this mutation, we hypothesize that the interaction of PTEN's N-terminal domain with the phosphatase domain is impacted by the H93R mutation, preventing PI(4,5)P(2) from inducing the conformational change that activates phosphatase activity.",

In both kidney-intercalated cells and epididymal clear cells, cAMP induces V-ATPase apical membrane accumulation, which is linked to proton secretion. We have shown previously that the A subunit in the cytoplasmic V(1) sector of the V-ATPase is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). Here we have identified by mass spectrometry and mutagenesis that Ser-175 is the major PKA phosphorylation site in the A subunit. Overexpression in HEK-293T cells of either a wild-type (WT) or phosphomimic Ser-175 to Asp (S175D) A subunit mutant caused increased acidification of HCO(3)(-)-containing culture medium compared with cells expressing vector alone or a PKA phosphorylation-deficient Ser-175 to Ala (S175A) mutant. Moreover, localization of the S175A A subunit mutant expressed in HEK-293T cells was more diffusely cytosolic than that of WT or S175D A subunit. Acute V-ATPase-mediated, bafilomycin-sensitive H(+) secretion was up-regulated by a specific PKA activator in HEK-293T cells expressing WT A subunit in HCO(3)(-)-free buffer. In cells expressing the S175D mutant, V-ATPase activity at the membrane was constitutively up-regulated and unresponsive to PKA activators, whereas cells expressing the S175A mutant had decreased V-ATPase activity that was unresponsive to PKA activation. Finally, Ser-175 was necessary for PKA-stimulated apical accumulation of the V-ATPase in a polarized rabbit cell line of collecting duct A-type intercalated cell characteristics (Clone C). In summary, these results indicate a novel mechanism for the regulation of V-ATPase localization and activity in kidney cells via direct PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the A subunit at Ser-175.",

Here we report the identification of a mutant p53, designated p53-46F, in which Ser-46 is replaced with phenylalanine. In vitro, adenovirus-mediated transduction of the p53-46F gene induced apoptosis more efficiently than wild-type p53 in a number of cancer cell lines, whereas Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53-46F was enhanced in all cancer cell lines examined. Moreover, the expression level of the cell cycle inhibitor p21/WAF1 was decreased in cell lines infected with adenovirus p53-46F (Ad-p53-46F). p53-46F caused a more enhanced level of transcriptional activation of several p53-target genes, including Noxa, p53AIP1 and p53RFP, compared with wild-type p53. In vivo, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of p53-46F enhanced apoptosis, thus suppressing tumor growth of a lung cancer cell line more effectively than wild-type p53 or p53-121F, another p53 mutant. Collectively, our data suggest that p53-46F is an active version of p53 that demonstrates enhanced induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. This is probably mediated by upregulated transactivation of genes downstream of p53, increased Ser-15 phosphorylation and a decrease in p21/WAF1 levels. We propose p53-46F as an alternative candidate to wild-type p53 for use in developing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer.",

However, E1A neither binds p27 nor prevents inhibition of CDK2 complexes in vivo. In contrast, the amount of free p27 available to inhibit cyclin E/CDK2 is increased in E1A-expressing cells, owing to reduced expression of cyclins D1 and D3. Moreover, E1A allows cell proliferation in the presence of supraphysiological p27 levels, while c-Myc, known to induce a cellular p27-inhibitory activity, is only effective against physiological p27 concentrations. E1A also bypasses G1 arrest by roscovitine, a chemical inhibitor of CDK2. Altogether, these findings imply that E1A can act downstream of p27 and CDK2. Retinoblastoma (pRb)-family proteins are known CDK substrates; as expected, association of E1A with these proteins (but not with p300/CBP) is required for E1A to prevent growth arrest by either p27 or the CDK4/6 inhibitor p16(INK4a). Bypassing CDK2 inhibition requires an additional function of E1A: the mutant E1A Delta26-35 does not overcome p27-induced arrest, while it binds pRb-family proteins, prevents p16-induced arrest, and alleviates pRb-mediated repression of E2F-1 transcriptional activity (although E1A Delta26-35 fails to restore expression of E2F-regulated genes in p27-arrested cells). We propose that besides the pRb family, E1A targets specific effector(s) of CDK2 in G1-S control.",

The fly genome encodes three proteins that bear only a single BEN domain (\"BEN-solo\" factors); namely, Insensitive (Insv), Bsg25A (Elba1), and CG9883 (Elba2). Insv homodimers preferentially bind CCAATTGG palindromes throughout the genome to mediate transcriptional repression, whereas Bsg25A and Elba2 heterotrimerize with their obligate adaptor, Elba3 (i.e., the ELBA complex), to recognize a CCAATAAG motif in the Fab-7 insulator. While these data suggest distinct DNA-binding properties of BEN-solo proteins, we performed reporter assays that indicate that both Bsg25A and Elba2 can individually recognize Insv consensus sites efficiently. We confirmed this by solving the structure of Bsg25A complexed to the Insv site, which showed that key aspects of the BEN:DNA recognition strategy are similar between these proteins. We next show that both Insv and ELBA proteins are competent to mediate transcriptional repression via Insv consensus sequences but that the ELBA complex appears to be selective for the ELBA site. Reciprocally, genome-wide analysis reveals that Insv exhibits significant cobinding to class I insulator elements, indicating that it may also contribute to insulator function. Indeed, we observed abundant Insv binding within the Hox complexes with substantial overlaps with class I insulators, many of which bear Insv consensus sites. Moreover, Insv coimmunoprecipitates with the class I insulator factor CP190. Finally, we observed that Insv harbors exclusive activity among fly BEN-solo factors with respect to regulation of Notch-mediated cell fate choices in the peripheral nervous system. This in vivo activity is recapitulated by BEND6, a mammalian BEN-solo factor that conserves the Notch corepressor function of Insv but not its capacity to bind Insv consensus sites. Altogether, our data define an array of common and distinct biochemical and functional properties of this new family of transcription factors.",

Ser29/30 mutation to Alanine inhibited ARNO interaction and was sufficient to block RLIP76-dependent cell spreading and migration, as well as RLIP76-dependent Arf6 activation. In contrast, RLIP76(S62A) interacted with ARNO and supported Arf6 activation. However, both sets of mutations blocked Rac1 activation. RLIP76-mediated Rac and Arf6 activation required PI3K activity. S29/30A mutations inhibited RLIP76-dependent PI3K activation, but S62A mutation did not.

This mutation eliminates phosphorylation of Ser-440, and Arg-442, not phosphorylation of Ser-440, appears primarily responsible for ChAT activity, with Ser-440 phosphorylation modulating catalysis.

The data demonstrate that BI-2 is a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptor activity with a peak effect at 2 microM. The mechanism of modulation is similar but not identical to that of neuroactive steroids. Similar to steroids, BI-2 acts by prolonging the mean open time duration through an effect on the duration and prevalence of the longest open time component. However, in contrast to many steroids, BI-2 does not selectively reduce the channel closing rate. The potentiating action of BI-2 seems to be mediated through interactions with the classic neuroactive steroid binding site. Mutation to the membrane-spanning region in the alpha1 subunit Q242W and the double mutation alpha1N408A/Y411F, previously shown to abolish potentiation by neurosteroids, also diminish potentiation by BI-2. At higher concentrations (>5 microM), BI-2 inhibits receptor function by enhancing the apparent rate of desensitization. From single-channel recordings, we estimate that the entry rate into the inhibited or blocked state, k(+B), is 0.50 microM(-1) s(-1). Based on the kinetic mechanism of action, and the finding that this effect is blocked by the alpha1V256S mutation, we propose that BI-2 acts through an inhibitory site first postulated for the inhibitory neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate.",

The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.",

Here we show that an acidic cluster on PACS-1, which is highly similar to acidic cluster sorting motifs on cargo molecules, acts as an autoregulatory domain that controls PACS-1-directed sorting. Biochemical studies show that Ser278 adjacent to the acidic cluster is phosphorylated by CK2 and dephosphorylated by PP2A. Phosphorylation of Ser278 by CK2 or a Ser278-->Asp mutation increased the interaction between PACS-1 and cargo, whereas a Ser278-->Ala substitution decreased this interaction. Moreover, the Ser278-->Ala mutation yields a dominant-negative PACS-1 molecule that selectively blocks retrieval of PACS-1-regulated cargo molecules to the TGN.

Two termination factors have been identified. Vaccinia termination factor/capping enzyme is a multifunctional heterodimer that also catalyzes the first three steps of mRNA cap formation and is an essential intermediate gene transcription initiation factor. Nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I) is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase. COOH-terminal deletion mutations of NPH I retain both ATPase and DNA binding activities but are unable either to terminate transcription or to act as dominant negative mutants in vitro. One appealing model posits that the COOH-terminal region of NPH I binds to one or more components in the termination complex. In an attempt to identify NPH I-related protein/protein interactions involved in transcription termination, a series of pull-down experiments were done. Among several vaccinia virus proteins tested, the H4L subunit, unique to the virion form of RNA polymerase, was shown to bind glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NPH I. To further confirm this interaction in virus-infected cells, we constructed recombinant vaccinia virus, vNPHINGST, that expresses GST-tagged NPH I. The H4L subunit of virion RNA polymerase specifically co-purified with GST-NPH I, consistent with a physical interaction. Through the analysis of a series of NH(2)- and COOH-terminal truncation mutations of H4L, the NPH I interaction site was localized to the NH(2)-terminal 195 amino acids of the H4L protein. The H4L binding site on NPH I was mapped to the COOH-terminal region between 457 and 631. Furthermore, COOH-terminal deletion mutations of NPH I failed to bind the NH(2)-terminal region of H4L, explaining their inability to support transcription termination. The COOH-terminal end of NPH I was also shown to be required for transcript release activity and for dominant negative inhibition of release. The requirement for an essential interaction between NPH I and H4L provides an explanation for the observed restriction of transcription termination to early viral genes.",

Initiation of SPP1 replication is independent of the host DnaA (replisome organizer), DnaB, DnaC and DnaI products, but requires the DnaG (DNA primase) and the DNA gyrase. Furthermore, SPP1 replication is independent of the DnaK (heat shock) protein. The phage-encoded products required for initiation of SPP1 replication have been genetically characterized. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence (3.292 kilobases) of the region where SPP1 initiation replication mutants map, revealed five open reading frames (orf). We have assigned genes 38, 39 and 40 to three of these orfs, which have the successive order gene 38-gene 39-orf39,1-gene 40-orf41. The direction of transcription of the reading frames, the lengths of the mRNAs as well as the transcription start point, upstream of gene 38 (PE2), were identified. Proteins of 29.9, 14.6 and 46.6 kDa were anticipated from translation of gene 38, gene 39 and gene 40, respectively. The purified G38P and G39P have estimated molecular masses of 31 and 15 kDa. G38P and G39P do not share significant identity with primary protein sequences currently available in protein databases, whereas G40P shares substantial homology with a family of DNA primase-associated DNA helicases. G38P binds specifically to two discrete SPP1 DNA restriction fragments (EcoRI-4 and EcoRI-3). The G38P binding site on EcoRI-4 was localized on a 393 bp DNA segment, which lies within the coding sequence of gene 38. The putative binding site on EcoRI-3 was inferred by DNA sequence homology, it maps in a non-coding segment. G39P, which does not bind to DNA, is able to form a complex with G38P. The organization of the SPP1 genes in the gene 38 to gene 40 interval resembles that one found in the replication origin regions of different Escherichia coli double-stranded DNA phages (lambda, phi 80 and P22). We propose that the conserved gene organization is representative of the replication origin region of a primordial phage.",

Biochemical studies using purified, recombinant Kelch protein showed that full-length Kelch bundles actin filaments, and kelch repeat 5 contains the actin binding site. Two-dimensional electrophoresis demonstrated that Kelch is tyrosine phosphorylated in a src64-dependent pathway. Site-directed mutagenesis determined that tyrosine residue 627 is phosphorylated. A Kelch mutant with tyrosine 627 changed to alanine (KelY627A) rescued the actin disorganization phenotype of kelch mutant ring canals, but failed to produce wild-type ring canals. Electron microscopy demonstrated that phosphorylation of Kelch is critical for the proper morphogenesis of actin during ring canal growth, and presence of the nonphosphorylatable KelY627A protein phenocopied src64 ring canals. KelY627A protein in ring canals also dramatically reduced the rate of actin monomer exchange.

The human PBR can be labeled with the benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 and with the isoquinoline carboxamide PK11195. The two ligands compete with each other in binding experiments, with previous results suggesting overlapping but not identical binding sites. To define the regions of the receptor interacting with PK11195 and Ro5-4864 and to address the question of the topology of the molecule in the membrane, we generated mutant human PBRs with amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions and with point mutations in potentially accessible cytoplasmic regions. The mutant genes were expressed in yeast and analyzed in binding experiments using radiolabeled PK11195 and Ro5-4864. The results showed that, whereas deletions in the amino-terminal sequence had marked consequences for the binding affinity of both ligands, the final 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus could be deleted with no effect on the binding of either Ro5-4864 or PK11195. The site-directed mutagenesis experiments pinpointed four amino acids as participating in the binding site of Ro5-4864. Three of these, Glu-29, Arg-32, and Lys-39, which are located in the first putative cytoplasmic loop, are conserved in human, bovine, rat, and mouse PBRs. The remaining residue, Val-154, which is found at the interface between the putative fifth transmembrane region and the cytoplasm, is present in the human, rat, and mouse sequences but is replaced by methionine in the bovine sequence. The exchange of Met-154 for valine in the bovine PBR introduced a binding site for Ro5-4864, which is absent in the native PBR. These four amino acids played a minor role, if any, in the binding site of PK11195. We also showed that the histidines previously suggested to be part of the binding site of PK11195 are not directly involved in the interaction of the human receptor with either PK11195 or Ro5-4864.",

Herein, we have localized the AP2-binding region of p53 to amino acids 305-375. Analysis of 26 distinct p53 alleles established a correlation between AP2alpha binding and transcriptional coactivation. The L350P point mutation was the only nonbinding allele that retained normal transcriptional activity by reporter assay. Although both wild-type and L350P alleles facilitated binding of AP2alpha to the p21 promoter, the L350P allele was significantly reduced in its ability to induce the endogenous p21 gene, demonstrating a striking difference in activity comparing reporter assays with activation of endogenous p53 target genes. Interestingly, expression of AP2 in the absence of radiation repressed p53-mediated induction of p21 and this effect was explained by a reduction in p53 stability induced by AP2alpha overexpression. We conclude that AP2alpha has competing effects on p53 activity through coactivation and decreased stability. These findings may provide a mechanism to account for the discrepancies reported for the association between AP2 and p21 expression in tumor tissue.",

Although the molecular mechanism that underlies conformational coupling between Ca(V)1.1 and RYR1 has been investigated intensely for more than 25 years, the question of whether such signaling occurs via a direct interaction between the principal, voltage-sensing \u03b1(1S) subunit of Ca(V)1.1 and RYR1 or through an intermediary protein persists. A substantial body of evidence supports the idea that the auxiliary \u03b2(1a) subunit of Ca(V)1.1 is a conduit for this intermolecular communication. However, a direct role for \u03b2(1a) has been difficult to test because \u03b2(1a) serves two other functions that are prerequisite for conformational coupling between Ca(V)1.1 and RYR1. Specifically, \u03b2(1a) promotes efficient membrane expression of Ca(V)1.1 and facilitates the tetradic ultrastructural arrangement of Ca(V)1.1 channels within plasma membrane-SR junctions. In this paper, we demonstrate that overexpression of the RGK protein Rem, an established \u03b2 subunit-interacting protein, in adult mouse flexor digitorum brevis fibers markedly reduces voltage-induced myoplasmic Ca(2+) transients without greatly affecting Ca(V)1.1 targeting, intramembrane gating charge movement, or releasable SR Ca(2+) store content. In contrast, a \u03b2(1a)-binding-deficient Rem triple mutant (R200A/L227A/H229A) has little effect on myoplasmic Ca(2+) release in response to membrane depolarization. Thus, Rem effectively uncouples the voltage sensors of Ca(V)1.1 from RYR1-mediated SR Ca(2+) release via its ability to interact with \u03b2(1a). Our findings reveal Rem-expressing adult muscle as an experimental system that may prove useful in the definition of the precise role of the \u03b2(1a) subunit in skeletal-type EC coupling.",

LRRK2 contains leucine-rich repeats, a GTPase domain, a COR [C-terminal of Roc (Ras of complex)] domain, a kinase and a WD40 (Trp-Asp 40) motif. Little is known about how LRRK2 is regulated, what its physiological substrates are or how mutations affect LRRK2 function. Thus far LRRK2 activity has only been assessed by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of MBP (myelin basic protein), which is catalysed rather slowly. We undertook a KESTREL (kinase substrate tracking and elucidation) screen in rat brain extracts to identify proteins that were phosphorylated by an activated PD mutant of LRRK2 (G2019S). This led to the discovery that moesin, a protein which anchors the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, is efficiently phosphorylated by LRRK2, at Thr558, a previously identified in-vivo-phosphorylation site that regulates the ability of moesin to bind actin. LRRK2 also phosphorylated ezrin and radixin, which are related to moesin, at the residue equivalent to Thr558, as well as a peptide (LRRKtide: RLGRDKYKTLRQIRQ) encompassing Thr558. We exploited these findings to determine how nine previously reported PD mutations of LRRK2 affected kinase activity. Only one of the mutations analysed, namely G2019S, stimulated kinase activity. Four mutations inhibited LRRK2 kinase activity (R1941H, I2012T, I2020T and G2385R), whereas the remainder (R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C and T2356I) did not influence activity. Therefore the manner in which LRRK2 mutations induce PD is more complex than previously imagined and is not only caused by an increase in LRRK2 kinase activity. Finally, we show that the minimum catalytically active fragment of LRRK2 requires an intact GTPase, COR and kinase domain, as well as a WD40 motif and a C-terminal tail. The results of the present study suggest that moesin, ezrin and radixin may be LRRK2 substrates, findings that have been exploited to develop the first robust quantitative assay to measure LRRK2 kinase activity.",

Further experiments showed that DAZAP1 was phosphorylated stoichiometrically in vitro by ERK2 (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase 2) at two Thr-Pro sequences (Thr269 and Thr315), and that both sites became phosphorylated in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells in response to PMA or EGF (epidermal growth factor), or RAW 264.7 macrophages in response to LPS.

DAZ interacts with PABP [poly(A)-binding protein] and thereby stimulates the translation of mRNAs containing short poly(A) tails [Collier, Gorgoni, Loveridge, Cooke and Gray (2005) EMBO J. 24, 2656-2666]. In the present study we have shown that DAZ cannot bind simultaneously to DAZAP1 and PABP, and suggest that the phosphorylation-induced dissociation of DAZ and DAZAP1 may allow the former to stimulate translation by interacting with PABP.",

The gene (Cil) contains the C-terminal region of the Chk1 gene, but the 5'-end is derived from a sequence in the intron of Chk1 preceding the C-terminal domain by differential RNA splicing. The kinase domain of Chk1 gene is absent in this isoform. Tissue RNA and protein blot analyses indicated that Cil was specifically expressed only in rat liver, and its expression increased with liver development. Expression of Cil was found to be reduced in three rat hepatoma cell lines examined. A promoter trap experiment suggested that a promoter was located in the intron preceding the C-terminal domain of Chk1, and transcription from this novel promoter generated the new 5' noncoding exon of Cil. Thus Cil was generated by both alternate promoter usage and differential RNA splicing. UV irradiation induced caffeine-sensitive phosphorylation of both Chk1 and Cil at Ser-345 in Chk1 and its equivalent site in Cil, implying a role for ATR kinase in the phosphorylation of both proteins. We demonstrated the interaction between the kinase domain of Chk1 and Cil using a yeast two-hybrid assay and pull-down technique. In contrast to the effect of Chk1, Cil was found to decrease the transactivating function of p53, and the S63A mutation of Cil abolished this effect. These results suggest that Cil may serve as a dominant negative competitor of Chk1 as suggested previously.",

This binding interaction was identified by both FLAG-tagged pull-down assays and tandem affinity purification from transfected and virus-infected human cells. M11L binds constitutively to human Bak and, under some inducible conditions, to human Bax as well, but not to the other Bcl-2 family members (Bad, Bid, Bcl-2). When stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, M11L effectively protects these cells from Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, thereby blocking release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 9, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We also demonstrate in coexpression studies that M11L can interact with Bak independently of any involvement with Bax. Furthermore, cells stably expressing M11L function to prevent apoptosis that is induced by overexpression of Bak.

The E120R gene product has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used as an antigen for antibody production. The antiserum anti-pE120R recognized a protein in infected cell extracts with an apparent molecular mass of 14.5 kDa, named p14.5.

Co-expression of full-length EGFR and oncogenic p185(neu) receptors resulted in an increased EGF-induced phosphotyrosine content of p185(neu), increased cell proliferation to limiting concentrations of EGF, and increases in both EGF-induced MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activation.

Ectodomain-deleted p185(neu) proteins (TDelta5) were unable to physically associate with EGFR, and extracellular domain-deleted p185(neu) forms failed to augment activation of MAPK and PI 3-kinase in response to EGF. Association of EGFR with a carboxyl-terminally truncated p185(neu) mutant (TAPstop) form did not increase transforming efficiency and phosphotyrosine content of the TAPstop species, and proliferation of EGFR.TAPstop-co-expressing cells in response to EGF was similar to cells containing EGFR only. Thus, neither cooperative nor inhibitory effects were observed in cell lines co-expressing either TDelta5 or TAPstop mutant proteins.

In metazoans, Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), which binds to 3' ends of canonical histone mRNAs, is a key factor in histone biosynthesis. SLBP is mainly expressed in S phase and this is a major mechanism to limit bulk histone production to the S phase. At the end of S phase, SLBP is rapidly degraded by proteasome, depending on two phosphorylations on Thr 60 and Thr 61. Previously, we showed that SLBP fragment (aa 51-108) fused to GST, is sufficient to mimic the late S phase (S/G2) degradation of SLBP. Here, using this fusion protein as bait, we performed pull-down experiments and found that DCAF11, which is a substrate receptor of CRL4 complexes, binds to the phosphorylated SLBP fragment. We further confirmed the interaction of full-length SLBP with DCAF11 and Cul4A by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We also showed that DCAF11 cannot bind to the Thr61/Ala mutant SLBP, which is not degraded at the end of S phase. Using ectopic expression and siRNA experiments, we demonstrated that SLBP expression is inversely correlated with DCAF11 levels, consistent with the model that DCAF11 mediates SLBP degradation. Finally, we found that ectopic expression of the S/G2 stable mutant SLBP (Thr61/Ala) is significantly more toxic to the cells, in comparison to wild type SLBP. Overall, we concluded that CRL4-DCAF11 mediates the degradation of SLBP at the end of S phase and this degradation is essential for the viability of cells. ",

In this study, we show that PGC-1 can potentiate TR-mediated transactivation of reporter genes driven by natural thyroid hormone response elements both in a ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manner and that the extent of coactivation is a function of the thyroid hormone response element examined. Our data also show that PGC-1 stimulation of TR activity in terms of Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion is strictly ligand-dependent. In addition, an E457A AF-2 mutation had no effect on the ligand-induced PGC-1 enhancement of TR activity, indicating that the conserved charged residue in AF-2 is not essential for this PGC-1 function. Furthermore, GST pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the PGC-1 LXXLL motif is required for ligand-induced PGC-1/TR interaction. This agonist-dependent PGC-1/TR interaction also requires both helix 1 and the AF-2 region of the TR ligand-binding domain. Taken together, these results support the notion that PGC-1 is a bona fide TR coactivator and that PGC-1 modulates TR activity via a mechanism different from that utilized with peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma.",

The disease is caused by mutations in either alpha(IIb)[glycoprotein (GP) IIb] or beta(3) (GPIIIa) genes that lead to a lack or dysfunction of the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) which serves as a fibrinogen receptor. PATIENTS: Mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations and platelet dysfunction consistent with GT were observed in three members of a Cypriot family: a 3-year-old proband, her father and her paternal uncle. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular basis of GT in this family and to characterize possible biochemical and structural defects. RESULTS: Analysis of the patients' platelets by fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated trace amounts of beta(3), no alpha(IIb) and no alpha(IIb)beta(3) on the membrane. Sequence analysis revealed a novel T607G transversion in exon 5 of the alpha(IIb) gene predicting a Phe171Cys alteration that created a PstI recognition site. All three patients were homozygous for the mutation, the mother and paternal grandparents of the proband were heterozygous, whereas 110 healthy subjects lacked this transversion. Chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with cDNAs of mutated alpha(IIb) and wild-type beta(3) failed to express alpha(IIb)beta(3) as shown by immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry experiments. Structural analysis of the alpha(IIb)beta(3) model, which was based on the crystal structure of alpha(v)beta(3), indicated that Phe171 plays an essential role in the interface between the beta-propeller domain of alpha(IIb) and the betaA domain of beta(3). CONCLUSIONS: A novel Phe171Cys mutation in the alpha(IIb) gene of patients with GT is associated with abrogation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) complex formation.",

DRA-mediated bicarbonate transport activity of 18 +/- 1 mM H+ equivalents/min was inhibited 53 +/- 2% by 100 mM of the CAII inhibitor, acetazolamide, but was unaffected by the membrane-impermeant carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, 1-[5-sulfamoyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-(aminosulfonyl-4-phenyl)]-2,6-dimethyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium perchlorate. Compared with AE1, the COOH-terminal tail of DRA interacted weakly with CAII. Overexpression of a functionally inactive CAII mutant, V143Y, reduced AE1 transport activity by 61 +/- 4% without effect on DRA transport activity (105 +/- 7% transport activity relative to DRA alone).

In the present study we investigated regions of p21 involved in inhibition of the G1/S phase cyclin-dependent kinase, cyclin E/Cdk2, as well as regions of p21 important for binding to this kinase and recombinant PCNA. To perform these studies we synthesized a series of overlapping peptides spanning the entire p21 sequence and used them in in vitro assays with cyclin E/Cdk2-immune complexes and with recombinant p21 and PCNA proteins. One amino-terminal p21 peptide spanning amino acids 15-40, antagonized p21 binding and inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase. Antagonism of p21 binding was, however, lost in a similar peptide lacking amino acids 15-20, or in a peptide in which cysteine-18 was substituted for a serine. These results suggest that this peptide region is important for p21 interaction with cyclin E/Cdk2. A second peptide (amino acids 58-77) also antagonized p21-activity, but this peptide did not affect the ability of p21 to interact with cyclin E/Cdk2. A region of p21 larger than 26 amino acids is presumably required for Cdk-inhibition because none of the peptides we tested inhibited cyclin E/Cdk2. We also found that a peptide spanning amino acids 21-45 bound recombinant p21 in ELISA assays, and additional studies revealed a requirement for amino acids 26 through 45 for this interaction. A p21 peptide spanning amino acids 139-164 was found to bind PCNA in a filter binding assay and this peptide suppressed recombinant p21-PCNA interaction. Conformational analysis revealed that peptides spanning amino acids 21-45 and 139-164 tended towards an alpha-helical conformation in trifluoroethanol buffer, indicating that these regions are probably in a coiled conformation in the native protein. Taken together, our results provide an insight into domains of p21 that are involved in cyclin E/Cdk2 and PCNA interaction. Our results also suggest that a potential p21 dimerization domain may lie in the amino-terminus of p21. Continued exploration of these domains could prove useful in assessing p21-mimetic strategies for cancer treatment.",

In in vitro experiments, immunoprecipitated active p38-MAPK phosphorylated and inhibited the activity of the active p20 subunits of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed that these phosphorylations occurred on serine-364 and serine-150, respectively. Introduction of mutated (S150A), but not wild-type, TAT-tagged caspase-3 into primary neutrophils made the Fas-induced apoptotic response insensitive to p38-MAPK inhibition.

In contrast to in vitro observations, we observed a PKC-mediated enhancement of forskolin- and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in HEK-AC6 cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also potentiated cyclic AMP accumulation in cells expressing endogenous AC6, including Chinese hamster ovary cells and differentiated Cath.a differentiated cells. In HEK-AC6-S674A cells, the potentiation of AC6 stimulation was significantly greater than in cells expressing AC6-WT. The positive effect of PKC activation on AC6 activity seemed to involve Raf1 kinase because the Raf1 inhibitor 3-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzylidene-5-iodo-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one (GW5074) inhibited the PKC potentiation of AC6 activity. Furthermore, the forskolin-stimulated activity of a recombinant AC6 in which the putative Raf1 regulatory sites have been eliminated was not potentiated by activation of PKC. The ability of Raf1 to regulate AC6 may involve a direct interaction because AC6 and a constitutively active Raf1 construct were coimmunoprecipitated. In addition, we report that epidermal growth factor receptor activation also enhances AC6 signaling in a Raf1-dependent manner. These data suggest that Raf1 potentiates drug-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in cells expressing AC6 after activation of multiple signaling pathways.",

One mutation (V449E) is located within the transmembrane domain and, by analogy with a similar mutation in the neu oncogene, may act by inducing dimerization of h beta c. The other mutation (I374N) lies in the extracellular, membrane-proximal portion of h beta c. Neither of these mutants, nor a previously described mutant of h beta c (FI delta, which has a small duplication in the extracellular region), was capable of inducing factor independence in CTLL-2 cells, while only V449E could induce factor independence in BAF-B03 cells. These results imply that the extracellular and transmembrane mutations act by different mechanisms.

The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) transactivates Trk receptors and thereby functions as a putative neurotrophin. Herein, we show that LRP1 is abundantly expressed in developing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and that LRP1-dependent cell signaling supports survival, neurite extension and receptivity to Schwann cells even in the absence of neurotrophins. Cultured embryonic DRG neurons (E15) were treated with previously characterized LRP1 ligands, LRP1-receptor binding domain of \u03b12-macroglobulin (RBD), hemopexin domain of MMP-9 (PEX) or controls (GST) for two weeks. These structurally diverse LRP1 ligands significantly activated and sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) 5-fold (p<0.05), increased expression of growth-associated protein-43(GAP43) 15-fold (P<0.01), and increased neurite outgrowth 20-fold (P<0.01). Primary sensory neurons treated with LRP1 ligands survived > 2 weeks in vitro, to an extent equaling NGF, a finding associated with canonical signaling mechanisms and blockade of caspase-3 cleavage. LRP1 ligand-induced survival and sprouting were blocked by co-incubation with the LRP1 antagonist, receptor associated protein (RAP), whereas RAP had no effect on NGF-induced activity. Site directed mutagenesis of the LRP1 ligand, RBD, in which Lys(1370) and Lys(1374) are converted to alanine to preclude LRP1 binding, were ineffective in promoting cell signaling, survival or inducing neurite extension in primary sensory neurons, confirming LRP1 specificity. Furthermore, LRP1-induced neurite sprouting was mediated by Src-family kinase (SFK) activation, suggesting transactivation of Trk receptors. Co-cultures of primary embryonic neurons and Schwann cells showed that LRP1 agonists promoted axonal receptivity to myelination to Schwann cells. Collectively, these findings identify LRP1 as a novel and perhaps essential trophic molecule for sensory neuronal survival and development.",

Here we identify sites within the striated muscle glycogen-binding subunit (G(M)) that mediate direct binding to glycogen synthase. Both PP1C and glycogen synthase were coimmunoprecipitated with a full-length FLAG-tagged G(M) transiently expressed in COS7 cells or C2C12 myotubes. Deletion and mutational analysis of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of the N-terminal domain of G(M) (residues 1-240) identified two putative sites for binding to glycogen synthase, one of which is the WXNXGXNYX(I/L) motif that is conserved among the family of PP1 glycogen-binding subunits. Either deletion of this motif or Ala substitution of Asn-228 in this motif disrupted the binding of glycogen synthase. Expression of full-length FLAG-G(M) in cells increased the activity of endogenous glycogen synthase, but protein disabled in either PP1 binding or glycogen synthase binding did not produce synthase activation. The results show that efficient activation of glycogen synthase requires a scaffold function of G(M) that involves simultaneous binding of both PP1C and glycogen synthase. Isoproterenol and forskolin treatment of cells decreased glycogen synthase binding to FLAG-G(M), thereby limiting synthase activation by PP1. This response was insensitive to inhibition by H-89, therefore probably not involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but did require inclusion of microcystin-LR during cell lysis, implying that phosphorylation was modulating binding of glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation control of binding to a scaffold site on the G(M) subunit of PP1 offers a new mechanism for regulation of muscle glycogen synthase in response to beta-adrenergic signals.",

This suggests that upon genotoxic stress, cells can convert latent p53 to one that is active for DNA binding. Surprisingly, we observed that latent p53 is as effective in activating transcription in vitro as is active p53. We found that HeLa nuclear extracts can stimulate DNA binding by latent p53 and have purified from them a p53-stimulating protein that we have determined to be the product of the Ref-1 gene. Interestingly, Ref-1 is a dual function protein that can both regulate the redox state of a number of proteins and function as a DNA repair (A/P) endonuclease. We observed that oxidized forms of full-length and carboxy-terminally truncated p53 (p53 delta30), which are inactive for DNA binding, are both stimulated by the Ref-1 protein. However, in the presence of reducing agent, Ref-1 is an extremely potent stimulator of full-length p53 but not p53 delta30. These and additional data indicate that Ref-1 protein stimulates p53 by both redox-dependent and -independent means and imply a key role for it in p53 regulation. Importantly, we have also determined that Ref-1 can stimulate p53 transactivation in vivo. This is the first example of a noncovalent protein modifier of p53 function identified in cells.",

The 45-kDa variant of the PTP TCPTP (TC45) exits the nucleus upon EGF receptor activation and recognizes the EGF receptor as a cellular substrate. We report that TC45 inhibits the EGF-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but does not alter the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. These data demonstrate that TC45 can regulate selectively mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways emanating from the EGF receptor. In EGF receptor-mediated signaling, the protein kinase PKB/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, function downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We have found that TC45 and the TC45-D182A mutant, which is capable of forming stable complexes with TC45 substrates, inhibit almost completely the EGF-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt. TC45 and TC45-D182A act upstream of PI 3-kinase, most likely by inhibiting the recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase by the EGF receptor. Recent studies have indicated that the EGF receptor can be activated in the absence of EGF following integrin ligation. We find that the integrin-mediated activation of PKB/Akt in COS1 cells is abrogated by the specific EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478, and that TC45 and TC45-D182A can inhibit activation of PKB/Akt following the attachment of COS1 cells to fibronectin. Thus, TC45 may serve as a negative regulator of growth factor or integrin-induced, EGF receptor-mediated PI 3-kinase signaling.",

By examining the role of FAK involved in LTP induction in dentate gyrus in vivo with medial perforant path stimulation, we found that both FAK and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation were increased significantly 5 and 10 min after LTP induction, whereas cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation was increased 40 min later. Transfection of the dominant-negative FAK mutant construct HA-FAK(Y397F) impaired LTP, whereas transfection of the constitutively activated form HA-FAK(Delta1-100) reduced the threshold for LTP induction. Transfection of HA-FAK(Delta1-100) by itself did not induce long-lasting potentiation. Further, transfection of the HA-FAK(Y397F) construct decreased FAK, MAPK/ERK, and CREB phosphorylation, and the inhibition of MAPK/ERK decreased CREB phosphorylation. Moreover, blockade of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) did not decrease FAK, MAPK/ERK, and CREB phosphorylation although LTP induction was blunted by NMDAR antagonist. These biochemical changes were not associated with low-frequency stimulation either. Immunoprecipitation results revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B as well as the association of phosphorylated FAK with NR2A and NR2B was increased with LTP induction. These results together suggest that FAK is required, but not sufficient, for the induction of LTP in a NMDAR-independent manner and that MAPK/ERK and CREB are the downstream events of FAK activation. Further, FAK may interact with NR2A and NR2B to modulate LTP induction.",

Mutants C9A, C10A, C9A/C10A, C9S/C10S, and truncated Gq alpha (removal of residues 1-6) were synthesized in Sf9 cells and purified. Loss of both Cys residues or truncation prevented palmitoylation of Gq alpha. However, truncated Gq alpha and the single Cys mutants activated phospholipase C-beta 1 normally, while the double Cys mutants were poor activators. Loss of both Cys residues impaired but did not abolish interaction of Gq alpha with m1 receptors. These Cys residues are thus important regardless of their state of palmitoylation. When expressed in HEK-293 or Sf9 cells, all of the proteins studied associated entirely or predominantly with membranes, although a minor fraction of nonpalmitoylated Gq alpha proteins accumulated in the cytosol of HEK-293 cells. When subjected to TX-114 phase partitioning, a significant fraction of all of the proteins, including those with no palmitate, was found in the detergent-rich phase. Removal of residues 1-34 of Gq alpha caused a loss of surface hydrophobicity as evidenced by complete partitioning into the aqueous phase.

Infection of neuronal cells from various PrP+/+ and PrP-/- (MoPrPKO) lines with MuLV yielded at least three times as many plaques in PrP+/+ than in PrP-/-. Furthermore, among the four PrP+/+ lines, one mutant line, P101L, had at least 2.5 times as many plaques as the other three PrP+/+ lines.

          "text": "One component of the anti-microbial function of lactoferrin (Lf) is its ability to sequester iron from potential pathogens. To overcome this iron limitation, a number of gram-negative bacterial pathogens have developed a mechanism for acquiring iron directly from this host glycoprotein. This mechanism involves surface receptors capable of specifically binding Lf from the host, removing iron and transporting it across the outer membrane. The iron is then bound by a periplasmic iron-binding protein, FbpA, and transported into the cell via an inner membrane complex comprised of FbpB and FbpC. The receptor has been shown to consist of two proteins, LbpA and LbpB. LbpB is bilobed lipoprotein anchored to the outer membrane via fatty acyl groups attached to the N-terminal cysteine. LbpA is a homologue of siderophore receptors, which consist of an N-terminal plug and a C-terminal beta-barrel region. We propose that the receptor proteins, LbpA and LbpB, induce conformational changes in human Lf (hLf) that lower its affinity for iron that binding by FbpA can drive the transport across the outer membrane, a mechanism shared with transferrin (Tf) receptors. The interaction between the receptor proteins and Lf is quite extensive and has been previously studied by using chimeric proteins comprised of Lf & Tf. In an attempt to evaluate the role of FbpA in the transport process, a series of site-directed mutants of FbpA were prepared and used to replace the wild-type protein in the iron acquisition pathway. The mutations were made in the iron-binding and anion-binding ligands of FbpA and were designed to result in altered binding properties. Protein crystallography of the iron-bound form of the Q58L mutant protein revealed that it was in the open conformation with iron coordinated by Y195 and Y196 from the C-terminal domain but not by the other iron-liganding amino acids from the N-terminal domain, H9 and E57. Replacement of the native FbpA in Neisseria meningitidis with wild-type or mutant Haemophilus influenzae FbpAs resulted in a defect in growth on Tf or Lf, suggesting that there may be a barrier to functional expression of H. influenzae FbpAs in Neisseria meningitidis. Thus mutants of the N. meningitidis FbpA are being prepared to replace wild-type protein in order to test their ability to mediate transport from hLf.",

These observations suggest that these mutant proteins were processed improperly, so that they were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and were not targeted correctly to the plasma membrane. Processing of the 150-kDa P-glycoprotein to the 170-kDa mature form of the enzyme for all of the mutants, except Glu707-->Ala and Tyr710-->Ala, was dramatically increased when the cells were grown at 26 degrees C. At the lower growth temperature, the mature protein was targeted to the plasma membrane, and drug efflux activity was restored. We also analyzed the mutants for possible molecular interactions that may contribute to their intracellular retention. We found that core-glycosylated forms of the wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins were associated with the molecular chaperone calnexin. Only wild-type enzyme, however, was able to escape association with calnexin and be targeted to the plasma membrane. Prolonged association of the mutants with calnexin may be due to misfolding of the protein as evidenced by their relative short half-life of about 3 h, compared with 50 h for the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that calnexin contributes to a quality control mechanism to retain misfolded forms of P-glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum.",

We identified two of these phosphoproteins as Cas and Cbl and showed that both bound to the Crk SH2 domain after BCR engagement. BCR ligation also increased the amount of Crk proteins in the particulate fraction of the cells and induced the formation of Crk.Cas and Crk.Cbl complexes in the particulate fraction. We propose that tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane-associated Cas and Cbl creates binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain and recruits Crk complexes to cellular membranes. Thus, Crk proteins may participate in BCR signaling by using their SH2 domains to direct the interactions and subcellular localization of proteins that bind to their SH3 domains. In RAMOS cells, we found that the SH3 domains of Crk-L and Crk II bound C3G.

Furthermore, reintroduction of DOK3 (K27R) into DOK3-deficient macrophages abolishes DOK3 degradation induced by CpG and suppresses the production of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. More importantly, our study uncovers a novel role of an E3 ligase TRAF6, namely, TRAF6 is also able to catalyse Lys 48 polyubiquitylation of target protein except for Lys 63 polyubiquitylation.",

The cleavage events release the virion structural proteins from the precursor and allow the virion to undergo maturation to become infectious. The protease cleavage between the matrix protein (MA) domain and the adjacent capsid protein (CA) domain releases CA from the membrane-anchored MA and allows the N terminus of CA to refold into a structure that facilitates the formation of hexamer arrays that represent the structural unit of the capsid shell. In this study, we analyzed the extent to which each of the HIV-1 Gag processing sites must be cleaved by substituting the P1-position amino acid at each processing site with Ile. A mutation that blocks cleavage at the MA/CA processing site (Y132I) displayed a strong transdominant effect when tested in a phenotypic mixing strategy, inhibiting virion infectivity with a 50% inhibitory concentration of only 4% of the mutant relative to the wild type. This mutation is 10- to 20-fold more potent in phenotypic mixing than an inactivating mutation in the viral protease, the target of many successful inhibitors, and more potent than an inactivating mutation at any of the other Gag cleavage sites. The transdominant effect is manifested as the assembly of an aberrant virion core. Virus containing 20% of the Y132I mutant and 80% of the wild type (to assess the transdominant effect on infectivity) was blocked either before reverse transcription (RT) or at an early RT step. The ability of a small amount of the MA/CA fusion protein to poison the oligomeric assembly of infectious virus identifies an essential step in the complex process of virion formation and maturation. The effect of a small-molecule inhibitor that is able to block MA/CA cleavage even partially would be amplified by this transdominant negative effect on the highly orchestrated process of virion assembly.",

In this report, we determined that replacement of the entire human I-domain with the entire murine I-domain in CD11a completely abrogated LFA-1 binding to human ICAM-1 without affecting the gross conformation or heterodimer formation of LFA-1, as assayed by antibody binding. In order to assess which residues of the I-domain are responsible for binding to ICAM-1, we tested the ability of a panel of human/murine I-domain chimeras to bind to human ICAM-1. When complexed with CD18, all CD11a chimeras bound ICAM-1 at levels comparable to wild-type CD11a/CD18, indicating that the residues in these chimeras which differ in human and murine I-domains may not play a critical role in LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1. A series of point mutations of residues that are conserved between murine and human CD11a I-domains, as well as between CD11b and CD11c, were also generated. Substitution of alanine for proline at position 192 in the human CD11a I-domain abrogated adhesion of LFA-1 to ICAM-1. Antibody binding data suggested that this was due to conformational changes within the I-domain. Mutation of the aspartic acids at positions 137 and 239 to either alanine or lysine completely destroyed ICAM-1 binding. The conformation of LFA-1 alanine mutants was not significantly altered. This suggests that these aspartic acids are required for binding of human LFA-1 to human ICAM-1.",

To explore the pore-forming mechanism of \u03b1-HL in detail, we determined the crystal structure of the \u03b1-HL monomer and prepore using H35A mutant and W179A/R200A mutant, respectively. Although the overall structure of the monomer was similar to that of other staphylococcal PFTs, a marked difference was observed in the N-terminal amino latch, which bent toward the prestem. Moreover, the prestem was fastened by the cap domain with a key hydrogen bond between Asp45 and Tyr118. Prepore structure showed that the transmembrane region is roughly formed with flexibility, although the upper half of the \u03b2-barrel is formed appropriately. Structure comparison among monomer, prepore and pore revealed a series of motions, in which the N-terminal amino latch released upon oligomerization destroys its own key hydrogen bond between Asp45-Tyr118. This action initiated the protrusion of the prestem. Y118F mutant and the N-terminal truncated mutant markedly decreased in the hemolytic activity, indicating the importance of the key hydrogen bond and the N-terminal amino latch on the pore formation. Based on these observations, we proposed a dynamic molecular mechanism of pore formation for \u03b1-HL.",

Unlike BRAF, CRAF requires continuous chaperoning by Hsp90 to retain MAPK signaling. However, the reason behind the continuous association of Hsp90 with CRAF is still elusive. In this study, we have identified the bipartite role of Hsp90 in chaperoning CRAF kinase. Hsp90 facilitates Ser-621 phosphorylation of CRAF and prevents the kinase from degradation. Co-chaperone Cdc37 assists in this phosphorylation event. However, after folding, the stability of the kinase becomes insensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, although the physical association between Hsp90 and CRAF remains intact. We observed that overexpression of Hsp90 stimulates MAPK signaling by activating CRAF. The interaction between Hsp90 and CRAF is substantially increased under an elevated level of cellular Hsp90 and in the presence of either active Ras (Ras(V12)) or EGF. Surprisingly, enhanced binding of Hsp90 to CRAF occurs prior to the Ras-CRAF association and facilitates actin recruitment to CRAF for efficient Ras-CRAF interaction, which is independent of the ATPase activity of Hsp90. However, monomeric CRAF (CRAF(R401H)) shows abrogated interaction with both Hsp90 and actin, thereby affecting Hsp90-dependent CRAF activation. This finding suggests that stringent assemblage of Hsp90 keeps CRAF kinase equipped for participating in the MAPK pathway. Thus, the role of Hsp90 in CRAF maturation and activation acts as a limiting factor to maintain the function of a strong client like CRAF kinase.",

The N-terminal domain of the alphaIIb subunit is folded in a beta-propeller that plays the role of binding fibrinogen and associating with the ligand-binding region of beta3. Analysing the mutations of Italian GT patients we found that a patient had a alphaIIb G236E missense substitution that substitutes a glycine from the highly conserved PhiPhiGPhi motif of blade 4 of the beta-propeller. To verify experimentally the effect of the substitution of glycine 236 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected with normal or mutated alphaIIb in conjunction with normal beta3. Using flow cytometry analysis we found the percentage of HEK cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 that reacted with anti alphaIIbbeta3 was very low. In HEK cells transfected with either alphaIIbbeta3 or alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 and lysed, when immunoblotting was done in non-reducing conditions a band reacting with an antibody against alphaIIb was present in both lysates, although less intense in cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3. In reducing condition alphaIIb from cells transfected with alphaIIbbeta3 was nearly all mature, while in cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 the ratio pro-alphaIIb: alphaIIb was 1 : 1, with signs of degradation of the mutated protein. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies against alphaIIb and immunoblotted with an antibody reacting with beta3. While in immunoblots from cells transfected with alphaIIbbeta3 a band corresponding to beta3 was strongly detectable, in immunoblots originating from cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 no band at the same level of normal beta3 was detected. Immunofluorescence studies showed accumulation of alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 in the endoplasmic reticulum and minimal transport to the Golgi. In conclusion we demonstrated that the alphaIIbG236E mutation causes GT by impairing the association with beta3 during biogenesis of the receptor.",

Based on genetic evidence that the Caenorhabditis elegans Cbl homolog, SLI-1, functions as a negative regulator of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase and our demonstration that Cbl's evolutionarily conserved N-terminal transforming region (Cbl-N; residues 1 to 357) harbors a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that binds to activated ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, we examined the possibility that oncogenic Cbl mutants may activate mitogenic signaling by deregulating cellular tyrosine kinase machinery. Here, we show that expression of Cbl-N and two other transforming Cbl mutants (CblY368 delta and Cbl366-382 delta or Cb170Z), but not wild-type Cbl, in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to enhancement of endogenous tyrosine kinase signaling. We identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR alpha) as one target of mutant Cbl-induced deregulation. In mutant Cbl transfectants, PDGFR alpha was hyperphosphorylated and constitutively complexed with a number of SH2 domain-containing proteins. PDGFR alpha hyperphosphorylation and enhanced proliferation of mutant Cbl-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were drastically reduced upon serum starvation, and PDGF-AA substituted for the maintenance of these traits. PDGF-AA stimulation of serum-starved Cbl transfectants induced the in vivo association of transfected Cbl proteins with PDGFR alpha. In vitro, Cbl-N directly bound to PDGFR alpha derived from PDGF-AA-stimulated cells but not to that from unstimulated cells, and this binding was abrogated by a point mutation (G306E) corresponding to a loss-of-function mutation in SLI-1. The Cbl-N/G306E mutant protein, which failed to induce enhanced growth and transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, also failed to induce hyperphosphorylation of PDGFR alpha. Altogether, these findings identify a novel mechanism of Cbl's physiological function and oncogenesis, involving its PTB domain-dependent direct interaction with cellular tyrosine kinases.",

However, the mechanistic details of how R776H contributes to kinase activation are not well understood. Here using cell-based cotransfection assays, we show that the R776H mutation activates EGFR in a dimerization-dependent manner by preferentially adopting the acceptor position in the asymmetric dimer. The acceptor function, but not the donor function, is enhanced for the R776H mutant, supporting the \"superacceptor\" hypothesis proposed for oncogenic mutations in EGFR. We also find that phosphorylation of monomeric EGFR is increased by R776H mutation, providing insights into EGFR lateral phosphorylation and oligomerization. On the basis of molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation, we propose a model in which loss of key autoinhibitory \u03b1C-helix capping interaction and alteration of coconserved cis regulatory interactions between the kinase domain and the flanking regulatory segments contribute to mutational activation. Since the R776 equivalent position is mutated in ErbB2 and ErbB4, our studies have implications for understanding kinase mutational activation in other ErbB family members as well.",

The T allele of the SNP is associated with increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) in Europeans and in Asians. This susceptibility is mediated by the T allele producing less GDF5 transcript relative to the C allele, a phenomenon known as differential allelic expression (DAE). The aim of this study was to identify trans-acting factors that bind to rs143383 and which regulate this GDF5 DAE. Protein binding to the gene was investigated by two experimental approaches: 1) competition and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and 2) an oligonucleotide pull down assay followed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Binding was then confirmed in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and the functional effects of candidate proteins investigated by RNA interference (RNAi) and over expression. Using these approaches the trans-acting factors Sp1, Sp3, P15, and DEAF-1 were identified as interacting with the GDF5 5'UTR. Knockdown and over expression of the factors demonstrated that Sp1, Sp3, and DEAF-1 are repressors of GDF5 expression. Depletion of DEAF-1 modulated the DAE of GDF5 and this differential allelic effect was confirmed following over expression, with the rs143383 T allele being repressed to a significantly greater extent than the rs143383 C allele. In combination, Sp1 and DEAF-1 had the greatest repressive activity. In conclusion, we have identified four trans-acting factors that are binding to GDF5, three of which are modulating GDF5 expression via the OA susceptibility locus rs143383. ",

In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that pp90rsk1 phosphorylates the N terminus of the wild-type ER but not of a mutant ER in which Ser-167 was replaced by Ala. In vivo, EGF stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-167 as well as Ser-118. Ectopic expression of active pp90rsk1 increased the level of phosphorylation of Ser-167 compared to that of either a mutant pp90rsk1, which is catalytically inactive in the N-terminal kinase domain, or to that of vector control. The ER formed a stable complex with the mutant pp90rsk1 in vivo. Transfection of the mutant pp90rsk1 depressed ER-dependent transcription of both a wild-type ER and a mutant ER that had a defective AF-2 domain (ER TAF-1). Furthermore, replacing either Ser-118 or Ser-167 with Ala in ER TAF-1 showed similar decreases in transcription levels. A double mutant in which both Ser-118 and Ser-167 were replaced with Ala demonstrated a further decrease in transcription compared to either of the single mutations.

In the heart, the best studied of these factors, GATA4, has multiple distinct roles in cardiac specification, differentiation, morphogenesis, hypertrophy and survival. To improve understanding of how GATA4 achieves its numerous roles in the heart, here we have focused on the carboxy-terminal domain and the residues required for interaction with cofactors FOG2 and Tbx5. We present evidence that the carboxy terminal region composed of amino acids 362-400 is essential for mediating cardiogenesis in Xenopus pluripotent explants and embryos. In contrast, the same region is not required for endoderm-inducing activity of GATA4. Further evidence is presented that the carboxy terminal cardiogenic region of GATA4 does not operate as a generic transcriptional activator. Potential mechanism of action of the carboxy terminal end of GATA4 is provided by the results showing physical and functional interaction with CDK4, including the enhancement of cardiogenic activity of GATA4 by CDK4. These results establish CDK4 as a GATA4 partner in cardiogenesis. The interactions of GATA4 with its other well described cofactors Tbx5 and FOG2 are known to be involved in heart morphogenesis, but their requirement for cardiac differentiation is unknown. We report that the mutations that disrupt interactions of GATA4 with Tbx5 and FOG2, G295S and V217G, respectively, do not impair cardiogenic activity of GATA4. These findings add support to the view that distinct roles of GATA4 in the heart are mediated by different determinants of the protein. Finally, we show that the rat GATA4 likely induces cardiogenesis cell autonomously or directly as it does not require activity of endodermal transcription factor Sox17, a GATA4 target gene that induces cardiogenesis non-cell autonomously.",

(1998) FEBS Lett. 424, 63-68). MUPP1 PDZ domain 10 (PDZ 10) associates with Ser458-Ser-Val at the carboxyl-terminal tail of the 5-HT2C R. Both Ser458 and Ser459 are phosphorylated upon serotonin stimulation of the receptor (Backstrom, J. R., Price, R. D., Reasoner, D. T., and Sanders-Bush, E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23620-23626). To investigate whether phosphorylation of these serines in the receptor regulates MUPP1 interaction, we used several approaches. First, we substituted the serines in the receptor carboxyl tail with aspartates to mimic phosphorylation (S458D, S459D, or S458D/S459D). Pull-down assays demonstrated that Asp mutations at Ser458 significantly decreased receptor tail interaction with PDZ 10. Next, serotonin treatment of 5-HT2C R/3T3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of receptor interaction with PDZ 10. Effects of serotonin on receptor-PDZ 10 binding could be blocked by pretreatment with a receptor antagonist. Alkaline phosphatase treatment reverses the effect of serotonin, indicating that agonist-induced phosphorylation at Ser458 resulted in a loss of MUPP1 association and also revealed a significant amount of basal phosphorylation of the receptor. We conclude that 5-HT2C R interaction with MUPP1 is dynamically regulated by phosphorylation at Ser458.",

It has been supposed that the carboxyl-terminal globular region of the alpha3 chain consisting of five distinct domains (G1 to G5) is important for its interaction with integrins. To clarify the function of each G domain, we transfected cDNAs for the full-length (wild type (WT)) and five deletion derivatives (DeltaGs) of the alpha3 chain into human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, which expressed and secreted the laminin beta3 and gamma2 chains but not the alpha3 chain. The transfectants with the alpha3 chain cDNAs lacking G5 (DeltaG(5)), G4-5 (DeltaG(4-5)), G3-5 (DeltaG(3-5)), and G2-5 (DeltaG(2-5)) secreted laminin-5 variants at levels comparable to that with WT cDNA. However, the transfectant with the cDNA without any G domains (DeltaG(1-5)) secreted little laminin-5, suggesting that the G domains are essential for the efficient assembly and secretion of the heterotrimer alpha3beta3gamma2. The transfectants with WT, DeltaG(5), and DeltaG(4-5) cDNAs survived in serum-free medium longer than those with DeltaG(3-5), DeltaG(2-5), and DeltaG(1-5) cDNAs. The transfectants with WT, DeltaG(5), and DeltaG(4-5) cDNAs secreted apparently the same size of laminin-5, which lacked G4 and G5 due to proteolytic cleavage between G3 and G4, and these laminin-5 forms potently promoted integrin alpha(3)beta(1)-dependent cell adhesion and migration. However, the laminin-5 forms of DeltaG(3-5) and DeltaG(2-5) hardly promoted the cell adhesion and motility. These findings demonstrate that the G3 domain, but not the G4 and G5 domains, of the alpha3 chain is essential for the potent promotion of cell adhesion and motility by laminin-5.",

Our previous studies revealed that the Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) protein participates in the formation of SGs. However, the functional significance of potential Tudor-SN modifications during stress has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that the Tudor-SN protein was phosphorylated at threonine 103 (T103) upon stimulation with arsenite. In addition, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was found to be responsible for Tudor-SN phosphorylation at the T103 site. We further illustrated that either a T103A mutation or the suppression of phosphorylation of T103 by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited the efficient recruitment of Tudor-SN into SGs. In addition, the T103A mutation could affect the physical binding of Tudor-SN with the G3BP (Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein) protein but not with the HuR (Hu antigen R) protein and AGTR1-3'UTR (3'-untranslated region of angiotensin II receptor, type 1) mRNA cargo. These data suggested that JNK-enhanced Tudor-SN phosphorylation promotes the interaction between Tudor-SN and G3BP and facilitates the efficient recruitment of Tudor-SN into SGs under conditions of sodium arsenite-induced oxidative stress. This finding provides novel insights into the physiological function of Tudor-SN modification.",

We solved the crystal structure of SycT at 2.5 angstroms resolution. Despite limited sequence similarity among TTSS chaperones, the SycT structure revealed a global fold similar to that exhibited by other structurally solved TTSS chaperones. The dimerization domain of SycT, however, differed from that of all other known TTSS chaperone structures. Thus, the dimerization domain of TTSS chaperones does not likely serve as a general recognition pattern for downstream processing of effector/chaperone complexes. Yersinia Yop effectors are bound to their specific Syc chaperones close to the Yop N termini, distinct from their catalytic domains. Here, we showed that the catalytically inactive YopT(C139S) is reduced in its ability to bind SycT, suggesting an ancillary interaction between YopT and SycT. This interaction could maintain the protease inactive prior to secretion or could influence the secretion competence and folding of YopT.",

To clarify the molecular mechanism of this feedback loop, we sought to identify the PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 and to investigate their biological significance. Upon incubation of recombinant IRS-1 fragments with PKC-zeta, we identified Ser(318) of rat IRS-1 (Ser(323) in human IRS-1) as the major in vitro phosphorylation site (confirmed by mutation of Ser(318) to alanine). To monitor phosphorylation of Ser(318) in cellular extracts, we prepared a polyclonal phosphosite-specific antibody. The biological significance was studied in baby hamster kidney cells stably expressing the insulin receptor (BHK(IR)). Using the phospho-Ser(318)-specific antibody we observed that insulin stimulates phosphorylation of Ser(318) in IRS-1, which is mediated, at least partially, by PKC-zeta. Moreover, we found that the previously described insulin-stimulated, PKC-zeta-mediated inhibition of the interaction of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor and the reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was abrogated by mutation of IRS-1 Ser(318) to alanine. These results, generated in BHK(IR) cells, suggest that phosphorylation of Ser(318) by PKC-zeta might contribute to the inhibitory effect of prolonged hyperinsulinemia on IRS-1 function.",

Constitutive activity of mutant EGF receptor amounted to 20% of that of wild type receptor stimulated by EGF. In addition, the mutant receptor was more sensitive to EGF, reaching maximum transforming activity at 5 ng/ml EGF. NIH3T3 cells expressing Glu627-EGF receptor showed a transformed phenotype and were not arrested in G0 upon serum deprivation. The mutant receptor was constitutively autophosphorylated, and several other cellular proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine in absence of the ligand. Among these, the SHC adaptor protein was phosphorylated in absence of EGF, the other adaptor, GRB-2 was constitutively associated with the Glu627-EGF receptor in vivo and in vitro, and mitogen-activated protein kinase was constitutively phosphorylated. In contrast, other EGF receptor substrates, like phospholipase C gamma, were not phosphorylated in absence of EGF. The mutant receptor showed a higher sensitivity to cleavage by calpain both in absence and presence of EGF, appeared as a 170- and 150-kDa doublet in cell extracts, and a specific calpain inhibitor blocked the appearance of the 150-kDa form. Since the calpain cleavage site is located in the receptor cytoplasmic tail, this finding suggests that the Glu627 mutation induces a slightly different conformation in the EGF receptor intracellular domain.

All of the 22 available structures of Lq2 in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) determined by NMR were considered during the simulation, which indicated that the conformation of Lq2 affects the binding between the two proteins significantly. Among the 22 structures of Lq2, only 4 structures dock in the binding site of the K(+) channel with a high probability and favorable electrostatic interactions. From the 4 candidates of the Lq2-K(+) channel binding models, we identified a good three-dimensional model of Lq2-K(+) channel complex through triplet contact analysis, electrostatic interaction energy estimation by BD simulation and structural refinement by molecular mechanics. Lq2 locates around the extracellular mouth of the K(+) channel and contacts the K(+) channel using its beta-sheet rather than its alpha-helix. Lys27, a conserved amino acid in the scorpion toxins, plugs the pore of the K(+) channel and forms three hydrogen bonds with the conserved residues Tyr78(A-C) and two hydrophobic contacts with Gly79 of the K(+) channel. In addition, eight hydrogen-bonds are formed between residues Arg25, Cys28, Lys31, Arg34 and Tyr36 of Lq2 and residues Pro55, Tyr78, Gly79, Asp80, and Tyr82 of K(+) channel. Many of them are formed by side chains of residues of Lq2 and backbone atoms of the K(+) channel. Thirteen hydrophobic contacts exist between residues Met29, Asn30, Lys31 and Tyr36 of Lq2 and residues Pro55, Ala58, Gly79, Asp80 and Tyr82 of the K(+) channel. These favorable interactions stabilize the association between the two proteins. These observations are in good agreement with the experimental results and can explain the binding phenomena between scorpion toxins and K(+) channels at the level of molecular structure. The consistency between the BD simulation and the experimental data indicates that our three-dimensional model of Lq2-K(+) channel complex is reasonable and can be used in further biological studies such as rational design of blocking agents of K(+) channels and mutagenesis in both toxins and K(+) channels.",

The B1R kinase is an early viral gene required for vaccinia virus DNA synthesis and replication, but no cellular substrate is known for this viral kinase. B1R is able to hyperphosphorylate p53 in several residues in the N-terminal transactivation domain, including Ser15 and Thr18. B1R does not phosphorylate Mdm2. B1R promotes an increase in p53 ubiquitination and a reduction of p53 acetylation by p300. The over-expressed B1R protein induces the degradation of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner and is lost when Ser15 and Th18 are changed to alanine or when the B1R kinase is inactivated by introducing the K149Q substitution. The B1R-induced downregulation of p53 requires Mdm2. The hyperphosphorylated p53 is transcriptionally active, and this activity also falls as B1R increases. The BAX gene promoter is more sensitive to this reduction of transcription than p21 or 14-3-3 gene promoters. This effect of B1R on p53 can be one of the mechanisms by which vaccinia virus exerts its role in infected cells.",

Overexpression of ATF3 (but not a mutated ATF3 protein (Delta102-139) devoid of its p53-binding region) prevents p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation and leads to increased transcription from p53-regulated promoters. ATF3, but not the Delta102-139 protein, binds the p53 carboxy-terminus and diminishes its ubiquitination and nuclear export. Genotoxic-stressed ATF3-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, or cells in which ATF3 was reduced by small interference RNA, show inefficient p53 induction and impaired apoptosis compared with wild-type cells. ATF3-null cells (but not wild-type cells), which poorly accumulate p53, are transformed by oncogenic Ras. Thus, ATF3 is a novel stress-activated regulator of p53 protein stability/function providing the cell with a means of responding to a wide range of environmental insult, thus maintaining DNA integrity and protecting against cell transformation.",

Phosphorylation of some serine/threonine residues in IRS-1 dampens insulin signaling, whereas phosphorylation of other serine/threonine residues enhances insulin signaling. Phosphorylation of human IRS-1 at Ser(629) was increased by insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the insulin receptor (1.26 +/- 0.09-fold; P < 0.05) and L6 cells (1.35 +/- 0.29-fold; P < 0.05) expressing human IRS-1. Sequence analysis surrounding Ser(629) revealed conformity to the consensus phosphorylation sequence recognized by Akt. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser(629) in cells was decreased upon treatment with either an Akt inhibitor or by coexpression with kinase dead Akt, whereas Ser(629) phosphorylation was increased by coexpression with constitutively active Akt. In addition, Ser(629) of IRS-1 is directly phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. In cells, preventing phosphorylation of Ser(629) by a Ser(629)Ala mutation resulted in increased phosphorylation of Ser(636), a known negative regulator of IRS-1, without affecting phosphorylation of Tyr(632) or Ser(616). Cells expressing the Ser(629)Ala mutation, along with increased Ser(636) phosphorylation, had decreased insulin-stimulated association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase with IRS-1 and decreased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473). Finally, in vitro phosphorylation of a Ser(629)-containing IRS-1 fragment with Akt reduces the subsequent ability of ERK to phosphorylate Ser(636/639). These results suggest that a feed-forward mechanism may exist whereby insulin activation of Akt leads to phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser(629), resulting in decreased phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser(636) and enhanced downstream signaling. Understanding the complex phosphorylation patterns of IRS-1 is crucial to elucidating the factors contributing to insulin resistance and, ultimately, the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.",

The cDNA for rat Cam kinase II-alpha was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 fibroblasts and the expressed protein purified to homogeneity by calmodulin-agarose affinity chromatography. A GST fusion protein comprising residues 1126-1255 of HER-2 was phosphorylated by purified Cam kinase II, in contrast to a GST protein comprising residues 1005-1125. Phosphoamino-acid analysis and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that HER-2 was phosphorylated on a single site at threonine-1172 which resides within a consensus Cam kinase II phosphorylation site (RAKT). HER-2 (threonine-1172-alanine), in the form of a ligand-inducible chimaera HER-1/2, was co-transfected into HEK-293 fibroblasts with a constitutively active form of Cam kinase II, followed by in vivo labelling of these cells with 32 P-orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation of ligand-activated receptors followed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping indicated that threonine-1172 in HER-2 is a newly identified in vivo site which can be hyper-phosphorylated by constitutively active Cam kinase II. In addition, when over-expressed in HEK-293 fibroblasts, HER-1/2 (threonine-1172-alanine) showed a defect in desensitisation and underwent a more sustained EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation compared to wild-type HER-1/2.",

We now show that the nuclear addressing of the homeodomains of Engrailed (EnHD) and Antennapedia (AntpHD) upregulates BPAG1e transcription in immortalized human keratinocytes (GMA24FIA) expressing En1. This upregulation is not observed with AntpHD-Q50A, a variant of AntpHD in which a single mutation abolishes its high-affinity binding to target DNA, thus strongly suggesting that BPAG1e upregulation homeodomains reflects their specific recognition of homeoprotein-binding sites in the BPAG1e locus. This is further confirmed by DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays that reveal, within the cloned BPAG1e promoter, several sites of direct interaction with EnHD and Engrailed. Co-transfection experiments in GMA24FIA human keratinocytes, COS-7 simian fibroblasts, and CHP-100 human neuroepithelial cells show that Engrailed, Hoxa-5, and Hoxc-8 regulate BPAG1e promoter activity and that this regulation is context-dependent. Finally, using a mouse line with LacZ inserted within the En1 locus, we identify the keratinocytes of the ventral paws, including the epithelial cells of the eccrine tubules, as a strong site of En1 expression throughout adulthood. We therefore propose that BPAG1e, a 230 kDa keratin-binding protein expressed in keratinocytes and participating in the maintenance of hemidesmosomes at the dermis-epidermis border, is directly regulated by homeoprotein transcription factors.",

The association of VEGFR2 with HSP90 involved the last 130 amino acids of VEGFR2 and was blocked by geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of HSP90. Moreover, geldanamycin inhibited the VEGF-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which resulted in an inhibition of phosphorylation of FAK on site Tyr(407). In this context, the inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) with Y27632 or by expression of dominant negative forms of RhoA or ROCK impaired the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr(407) within FAK. In contrast to phosphorylation of Tyr(861), the phosphorylation of site Tyr(407) was insensitive to Src kinase inhibition by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP2). We also found that the recruitment of paxillin to FAK was inhibited by geldanamycin but not by PP2, whereas both geldanamycin and PP2 inhibited the recruitment of vinculin to FAK. In accordance, the recruitment of paxillin and vinculin to FAK was inhibited in cells that express the mutant FAK-Y407F, whereas the expression of the mutant Y861F inhibited the recruitment of paxillin but not of vinculin. Importantly, cell migration was abolished in cells in which the signal from the VEGFR2-HSP90 pathway was blocked by the expression of Delta130VEGFR2, a deletant of VEGFR2 that does not associate with HSP90.

To determine the function of the -74 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism, we have characterized the proximal promoter of the mouse p18 gene. Functional analysis of the 5' flanking region by sequential deletions revealed crucial elements between -300 and +1, confirming the in silico prediction that the -74 T allele created a novel Yin-Yang 1 (YY-1) binding site adjacent to an existing one common to both alleles. Moreover, we found that YY-1, E2F1, and Sp-1 can synergistically enhance the activity of the p18 promoter. Mutational inactivation revealed that YY-1 binding regulates the p18 activity in an allele-dependent fashion. EMSAs with splenic B cell extracts directly demonstrated that YY-1 binds to the p18 promoter with differences between the C and the T alleles. We also determined in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation that the T allele resulted in increased YY-1 and decreased Nrf-2 binding to the p18 promoter as compared with the C allele in B cells. Thus, YY-1 is a direct regulator of p18 gene expression in an allele-dependent fashion that is consistent with the lupus-associated T allele, inducing a lower p18 transcriptional activity by increasing YY-1 binding. These results establish the p18 -74 C/T mutation as the leading causal variant for the B1a cell expansion that characterizes the NZB and NZM2410 lupus-prone strains.",

Inhibition of p53 activated transcription plays a key role in processes by which E1B-55K executes its oncogenic potential. Nevertheless, additional functions of E1B-55K or further protein interactions with cellular factors of DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis, including Mre11, PML, and Daxx, may also contribute to the transformation process. In line with previous results, we performed mutational analysis to define a Daxx interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. The results from these studies showed that E1B-55K/Daxx binding is not required for inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or binding and degradation of cellular factors (p53/Mre11). Surprisingly, these mutants lost the ability to degrade Daxx and showed reduced transforming potential in primary rodent cells. In addition, we observed that E1B-55K lacking the SUMO-1 conjugation site (SCS/K104R) was sufficient for Daxx interaction but no longer capable of E1B-55K-dependent proteasomal degradation of the cellular factor Daxx. These results, together with the observation that E1B-55K SUMOylation is required for efficient transformation, provides evidence for the idea that SUMO-1-conjugated E1B-55K-mediated degradation of Daxx plays a key role in adenoviral oncogenic transformation. We assume that the viral protein contributes to cell transformation through the modulation of Daxx-dependent pathways. This further substantiates the assumption that further mechanisms for efficient transformation of primary cells can be separated from functions required for the inhibition of p53-stimulated transcription.",

Using a novel polyclonal antibody to ALK-1, we measured ALK-1 expression on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) of newborns from HHT families whose affected members had normal endoglin levels. ALK-1 levels were specifically reduced in three HUVEC with ALK-1 missense mutant codons, and normal in two newborns not carrying the missense mutations present in the clinically affected relatives. Levels were also normal in a HUVEC with deletion of S232 in the ATP binding site of ALK-1. Thus HHT2 appears to be associated with a loss of function of the mutant allele due to a reduction in either protein level or activity. We also report three new ALK-1 missense mutations leading to G48E/A49P, C344Y and E407D substitutions. In COS-1 transfected cells, ALK-1 was found in the TGF-beta1 and -beta3 receptor complexes in association with endoglin and TbetaRII, but not in activin receptor complexes containing endoglin. In HUVEC, ALK-1 was not detectable in the TGF-beta1 or -beta3 receptor complexes. However, in the absence of ligand, ALK-1 and endoglin interactions were observed by immunoprecipitation/western blot in HUVEC from normal as well as HHT1 and HHT2 patients. Our data suggest a transient association between these two proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily, both required at a critical level to ensure vessel wall integrity.",

A leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) near the C terminus of RanBP1 is essential to maintain this distribution. We now show that RanBP1 accumulates in nuclei of cells treated with the export inhibitor, leptomycin B, and collapse of the nucleocytoplasmic Ran:GTP gradient leads to equilibration of RanBP1 across the nuclear envelope. Low temperature prevents nuclear accumulation of RanBP1, suggesting that import does not occur via simple diffusion. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RanBP1(1-161), which lacks the NES, accumulates in the nucleus after cytoplasmic microinjection. In permeabilized cells, nuclear accumulation of GST-RanBP1(1-161) requires nuclear Ran:GTP but is not inhibited by a dominant interfering G19V mutant of Ran. Nuclear accumulation is enhanced by addition of exogenous karyopherins/importins or RCC1, both of which also enhance nuclear Ran accumulation. Import correlates with Ran concentration. Remarkably, an E37K mutant of RanBP1 does not import into the nuclei under any conditions tested despite the fact that it can form a ternary complex with Ran and importin beta. These data indicate that RanBP1 translocates through the pores by an active, nonclassical mechanism and requires Ran:GTP for nuclear accumulation. Shuttling of RanBP1 may function to clear nuclear pores of Ran:GTP, to prevent premature release of import cargo from transport receptors.",

To investigate the biochemical consequence and biologic significance of these mutations, retroviral vectors encoding KITG559 or KITV814 were introduced into murine pro-B-type Ba/F3 cells and myeloid FDC-P1 cells, both of which require interleukin-3 (IL-3) for their growth and survival. In the cells, KITG559 or KITV814 were found to be constitutively phophorylated on tyrosine in the absence of stem cell factor (SCF) that is a ligand for KIT. Chemical cross-linking analysis showed that a substantial fraction of the phosphorylated KITG559 underwent dimerization even in the absence of SCF, whereas the phosphorylated KITV814 did not, suggesting the distinct mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of KIT by G559 and V814 mutations. Furthermore, the cells expressing either KITG559 or KITV814 were found to show a factor-independent growth, whereas the cells expressing wild-type KIT (KITWT) proliferated in response to SCF as well as IL-3. Moreover, subcutaneous injection of Ba/F3 cells expressing KITG559 or KITV814 into nude mice resulted in production of large tumors at all sites of the injection within 2 weeks, and all nude mice quickly succumbed to leukemia and died. These results suggest that, although the mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of KITG559 or KITV814 may be different, both of the activating mutations have a function to induce a factor-independent and tumorigenic phenotype. Also, the data of this study raise the possibility that the constitutively activating mutations of c-kit may play a causal role in development of hematologic malignancies.",

Depending on the cellular context, Ras activation may have different biological consequences: induction of cell proliferation, senescence, survival, or death. Augmentation and selective activation of particular effector molecules may underlie various Ras actions. In fact, Ras effector-loop mutants interacting with distinctive effectors provide evidence for such selectivity. Interactions of active Ras with escort proteins, such as galectin-1, could also direct Ras selectivity. Here we show that in comparison with Ras transfectants, H-Ras/galectin-1 or K-Ras4B/galectin-1 co-transfectants exhibit enhanced and prolonged epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated increases in Ras-GTP, Raf-1 activity, and active extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Galectin-1 antisense RNA inhibited these EGF responses. Conversely, Ras and galectin-1 co-transfection inhibited the EGF-stimulated increase in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Galectin-1 transfection also inhibited Ras(G12V)-induced PI3K but not Raf-1 activity. Galectin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with Ras(G12V) or with Ras(G12V/T35S) that activate Raf-1 but not with Ras(G12V/Y40C) that activates PI3K. Thus, galectin-1 binds active Ras and diverts its signal to Raf-1 at the expense of PI3K. This demonstrates a novel mechanism controlling the duration and selectivity of the Ras signal. Ras gains selectivity when it is associated with galectin-1, mimicking the selectivity of Ras(T35S), which activates Raf-1 but not PI3K.",

We have previously identified a Ypt1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and characterized it as a large membrane-associated protein complex that localizes to the Golgi and can be extracted from the membrane by salt, but not by detergent. TRAPP is a large protein complex that is required for ER-to-Golgi transport and that has properties similar to those of Ypt1 GEF. Here we show that TRAPP has Ypt1 GEF activity. GST-tagged Bet3p or Bet5p, two of the TRAPP subunits, were expressed in yeast cells and were precipitated by glutathione-agarose (GA) beads. The resulting precipitates can stimulate both GDP release and GTP uptake by Ypt1p. The majority of the Ypt1 GEF activity associated with the GST-Bet3p precipitate has an apparent molecular weight of > 670 kDa, indicating that the GEF activity resides in the TRAPP complex. Surprisingly, TRAPP can also stimulate nucleotide exchange on the Ypt31/32 GTPases, but not on Sec4p, a Ypt-family GTPase required for the last step of the exocytic pathway. Like the previously characterized Ypt1 GEF, the TRAPP Ypt1-GEF activity can be inhibited by the nucleotide-free Ypt1-D124N mutant protein. This mutant protein also inhibits the Ypt32 GEF activity of TRAPP. Coprecipitation and overexpression studies suggest that TRAPP can act as a GEF for Ypt1 and Ypt31/32 in vivo. These data suggest the exciting possibility that a GEF complex common to Ypt1 and Ypt31/32 might coordinate the function of these GTPases in entry into and exit from the Golgi.",

Membrane targeting of a tyrosine-mutated form of Crk could overcome inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity, providing functional evidence that Crk phosphorylation contributes to inhibition.

In this work, we have identified 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- and growth factor-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in p52(Shc) and p66(Shc). Among them, Ser(29) in p52(Shc) (equivalent to Ser(138) in p66(Shc)) was phosphorylated only after TPA stimulation. Phosphorylation of this site together with the intact phosphotyrosine-binding domain was essential for ShcA binding to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST. TPA-induced ShcA phosphorylation at this site (and hence, its association with PTP-PEST) was inhibited by a protein kinase C-specific inhibitor and was induced by overexpression of constitutively active mutants of protein kinase Calpha, -epsilon, and -delta isoforms. Insulin also induced ShcA/PTP-PEST association, although to a lesser extent than TPA. Overexpression of a PTP-PEST binding-defective mutant of p52(Shc) (S29A) enhanced insulin-induced ERK activation in insulin receptor-overexpressing HIRc-B cells. Consistent with this, p52(Shc) S29A was more tyrosine-phosphorylated than wild-type p52(Shc) after insulin stimulation. Thus, we have identified a new mechanism whereby serine phosphorylation of ShcA controls the ability of its phosphotyrosine-binding domain to bind PTP-PEST, which is responsible for the dephosphorylation and down-regulation of ShcA after insulin stimulation.",

Here we examined whether Gpa1p is palmitoylated and determined the functional consequences of this modification. [3H]-Palmitic acid was incorporated into Gpa1p in cells expressing myc-tagged Gpa1p or Gpa1p-Gst. The label was released upon hydroxylamine treatment. Substitution of the conserved Cys 3 for Ser blocked incorporation of the label (Gpa1pC3S). Palmitoylation was also blocked by a mutation that prevents myristoylation (Gly2Ala), whereas the palmitoylation-site mutation had no effect on myristoylation of Gpa1p. Gpa1pC3S complemented the gpa1 delta mutation in vivo and formed a complex with G beta gamma that was able to undergo nucleotide exchange in vitro. However, basal and pheromone-induced FUSl-lacZ transcription were 2-5-fold higher in the C3S mutant. Pheromone-induced growth arrest was also enhanced by the mutation, but recovery from arrest was not affected. Like wild-type Gpa1p, the C3S mutant was predominantly membrane-associated. Upon Triton X-114 partitioning or high pH treatment, no difference in the membrane-binding properties of the wild-type Gpa1p and the C3S mutant was detected. By sucrose density gradient centrifugation of membranes, however, most of the mutant protein was mislocalized to a non-plasma membrane compartment, whereas G beta gamma localization was unaltered.

To discern a mechanism by which GRK2-mediated phosphorylation can desensitize the PDGFRbeta, but not the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we investigated effects of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation on the association of the PDGFRbeta with the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF), a protein shown to potentiate dimerization of the PDGFRbeta, but not the EGFR. Physiologic expression of GRK2 diminished (a) phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited through the PDGFRbeta but not heterotrimeric G proteins; (b) Akt activation evoked by the PDGFRbeta but not the EGFR; and (c) PDGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of the PDGFRbeta itself. PDGFRbeta desensitization by physiologically expressed GRK2 correlated with a 2.5-fold increase in PDGF-promoted PDGFRbeta seryl phosphorylation. In 293 cells, GRK2 overexpression reduced PDGFRbeta/NHERF association by 60%. This effect was reproduced by S1104D mutation of the PDGFRbeta, which also diminished PDGFRbeta activation and signaling (like the S1104A mutation) to an extent equivalent to that achieved by GRK2-mediated PDGFRbeta phosphorylation. GRK2 overexpression desensitized only the wild type but not the S1104A PDGFRbeta. We conclude that GRK2-mediated PDGFRbeta seryl phosphorylation plays an important role in desensitizing the PDGFRbeta in physiologic systems. Furthermore, this desensitization appears to involve GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of PDGFRbeta Ser(1104), with consequent dissociation of the PDGFRbeta from NHERF.",

While the mechanism of Fas-mediated cell death has become elucidated, the requirements for Fas ligand binding to the receptor have not been fully defined. Using a series of chimeric Fc-receptor fusion proteins between the human Fas receptor and TNFR I, each cysteine-rich domain of Fas was found to be required for interaction with the Fas ligand. Interestingly, TNFR I CRD1 could partially substitute for the Fas CRD1. The importance of this domain was underscored by the analysis of a Fas extracellular mutation (C66R), which resulted in a complete loss of ligand binding. This mutation was cloned from a human patient suffering from Canale-Smith syndrome, which is characterized by autoimmunity resembling that observed in the lpr and lprcg mice.

METHODS: Wild-type (WT) RyR2 central domain constructs (G(2236)to G(2491)) and those containing the CPVT mutations P2328S and N2386I, were expressed as recombinant proteins. Folding and stability of the proteins were examined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and guanidine hydrochloride chemical denaturation. RESULTS: The far-UV CD spectra showed a soluble stably-folded protein with WT and mutant proteins exhibiting a similar secondary structure. Chemical denaturation analysis also confirmed a stable protein for both WT and mutant constructs with similar two-state unfolding. ATP and caffeine binding was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Both ATP and caffeine bound with an EC50 of ~200-400\u03bcM, and the affinity was the same for WT and mutant constructs. Sequence alignment with other ATP binding proteins indicated the RyR2 central domain contains the signature of an ATP binding pocket. Interaction of the central domain with FKBP12.6 was tested by glutaraldehyde cross-linking and no association was found. CONCLUSIONS: The RyR2 central domain, expressed as a 'correctly' folded recombinant protein, bound ATP in accord with bioinformatics evidence of conserved ATP binding sequence motifs. An interaction with FKBP12.6 was not evident. CPVT mutations did not disrupt the secondary structure nor binding to ATP. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Part of the RyR2 central domain CPVT mutation cluster, can be expressed independently with retention of ATP binding.",

It is amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human tumors including melanoma. Here we show a previously undescribed role for GAB2 in NRAS-driven melanoma. Specifically, we found that GAB2 is co-expressed with mutant NRAS in melanoma cell lines and tumor samples and its expression correlated with metastatic potential. Co-expression of GAB2(WT) and NRAS(G12D) in melanocytes and in melanoma cells increased anchorage-independent growth by providing GAB2-expressing cells a survival advantage through upregulation of BCL-2 family of anti-apoptotic factors. Of note, collaboration of GAB2 with mutant NRAS enhanced tumorigenesis in vivo and led to an increased vessel density with strong CD34 and VEGFR2 activity. We found that GAB2 facilitiated an angiogenic switch by upregulating HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF levels. This angiogenic response was significantly suppressed with the MEK inhibitor PD325901. These data suggest that GAB2-mediated signaling cascades collaborate with NRAS-driven downstream activation for conferring an aggressive phenotype in melanoma. Second, we show that GAB2/NRAS signaling axis is non-linear and non-redundant in melanocytes and melanoma, and thus are acting independent of each other. Finally, we establish a link between GAB2 and angiogenesis in melanoma for the first time. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that GAB2 is a novel regulator of tumor angiogenesis in NRAS-driven melanoma through regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expressions mediated by RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling.",

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by the loss of dystrophin, which can result from the loss of this binding. The N-terminal part of the latter binding site of dystrophin has been well documented using overlay assay and X-ray diffraction assays. However, the binding site at the C-terminal region of dystrophin has not been examined in detail. In the present work, we report a detailed analysis of the C-terminal binding domain as follows. (1). The full binding activity corresponding to the effective binding in vivo is expressed by the dystrophin fragment spanning amino acids 3026-3345 containing the ZZ domain at the C-terminus. Determination of this binding range is important not only for understanding of the mechanism of dystrophy, but also useful for the design of truncated dystrophin constructs for gene therapy. (2). The ZZ domain binds to EF1 domain in the dystrophin fragment to reinforce the binding activity. (3). The cysteine 3340 in the ZZ domain is essential for the binding of dystrophin to beta-dystroglycan. A reported case of DMD due to missense mutation C3340Y may be caused by inability to fix dystrophin beneath the cell membrane. (4). The binding mode of utrophin is different from that of dystrophin. The difference is conspicuous concerning the cysteine residues present in the ZZ domain.",

The C-terminal or reductase domain binds FMN, FAD and NADPH. The N-terminal or oxygenase domain is known to bind arginine, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) and haem. The exact residues of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein involved in binding to these molecules have yet to be identified, although the haem moiety is known to be co-ordinated through a cysteine thiolate ligand. We have expressed two forms of the haem-binding domain of human iNOS (residues 1-504 and 59-504) in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The iNOS 1-504 and 59-504 fusion proteins bound similar amounts of haem, Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (nitroarginine) and tetrahydrobiopterin, showing that the first 58 residues are not required for binding these factors. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have mutated Cys-200, Cys-217, Cys-228, Cys-290, Cys-384 and Cys-457 to alanine residues within the iNOS 59-504 haem-binding domain. Mutation of Cys-200 resulted in a complete loss of haem, nitroarginine and tetrahydrobiopterin binding. Mutants of Cys-217, Cys-228, Cys-290, Cys-384 or Cys-457 showed no effect on the haem content of the fusion protein, no effect on the reduced CO spectral peak (444 nm) and were able to bind nitroarginine and tetrahydrobiopterin at levels equivalent to the wild-type fusion protein. After removal of the GST polypeptide, the wild-type iNOS 59-504 domain was dimeric, whereas the C200A mutant form was monomeric. When the mutated domains were incorporated into a reconstructed full-length iNOS protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes, only the Cys-200 mutant showed a loss of catalytic activity: all the other mutant iNOS proteins showed near wild-type enzymic activity. From this systematic approach we conclude that although Cys-217, Cys-228, Cys-290, Cys-384 and Cys-457 are conserved in all three NOS isoforms they are not essential for cofactor or substrate binding or for enzymic activity of iNOS, and that Cys-200 provides the proximal thiolate ligand for haem binding in human iNOS.",

By contrast, a p130(cas) D748E mutant, which was unable to produce 31-kDa, attenuated the disassembly of focal adhesions at the bottom of the cell. 31-kDa contains a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain that shows greater sequence homology with Id proteins than with basic HLH proteins, which enabled heterodimerization with E2A. Once coupled to E2A, 31-kDa was translocated to the cell nucleus, where it inhibited E2A-mediated p21(Waf1/Cip1) transcription. Moreover, overexpression of 31-kDa led to cell death that could be inhibited by treatment with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fluoromethyl ketone or by ectopic expression of E2A or p21(Waf1/Cip1). These data suggest that during etoposide-induced apoptosis, 31-kDa promotes caspase-mediated cell death by inhibiting E2A-mediated activation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) transcription.",

Kabuki syndrome, another developmental disorder, is characterized by typical facial features in combination with developmental delay, short stature, prominent digit pads and visceral abnormalities. Mutations in the KMT2D gene, which encodes a H3K4 histone methyltransferase, are the major cause of Kabuki syndrome. Here, we report a patient, who was initially diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome based on the spectrum of inner organ malformations like choanal hypoplasia, heart defect, anal atresia, vision problems and conductive hearing impairment. While sequencing and MLPA analysis of all coding exons of CHD7 revealed no pathogenic mutation, sequence analysis of the KMT2D gene identified the heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation c.5263C > T (p.Gln1755*). Thus, our patient was diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome. By using co-immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry and direct yeast two hybrid assays, we could show that, like KMT2D, CHD7 interacts with members of the WAR complex, namely WDR5, ASH2L and RbBP5. We therefore propose that CHD7 and KMT2D function in the same chromatin modification machinery, thus pointing out a mechanistic connection, and presenting a probable explanation for the phenotypic overlap between Kabuki and CHARGE syndromes.",

Here we present evidence that stabilization and activation of p53 by spindle disruption requires the spindle checkpoint kinase TTK/hMps1. TTK/hMps1 phoshorylates the N-terminal domain of p53 at Thr18, and this phosphorylation disrupts the interaction with MDM2 and abrogates MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Phosphorylation at Thr18 enhances p53-dependent activation of not only p21 but also Lats2, two mediators of the postmitotic checkpoint. Furthermore, a phospho-mimicking substitution at Thr18 (T18D) is more competent than the phospho-deficient mutant (T18A) in rescuing the tetraploid checkpoint defect of p53-depleted cells. Our findings therefore provide a mechanism connecting the spindle checkpoint with p53 in the maintenance of genome stability.",

Here, we have studied the molecular determinants of Rim1 that are responsible for Rab3 binding, employing surface plasmon resonance and recombinant, bacterially expressed Rab3 and Rim1 proteins. A site that binds GTP- but not GDP-saturated Rab3 was localized to a short alpha-helical sequence near the Rim1 N terminus (amino acids 19-55). Rab3 isoforms A, C, and D were bound with similar affinities (K(d) = 1-2 microm). Low affinity binding of Rab6A-GTP was also observed (K(d) = 16 microm), whereas Rab1B, -5, -7, -8, or -11A did not bind. Adjacent sequences up to amino acid 387, encompassing differentially spliced sequences, the zinc finger module, and the SGAWFF motif of Rim1, did not significantly contribute to the strength or the specificity of Rab3 binding, whereas a point mutation within the helix (R33G) abolished binding. This Rab3 binding site of Rim1 is reminiscent of the N-terminal alpha-helix that is part of the Rab3-binding region of rabphilin-3, and indeed we observed low affinity, specific binding of Rab3A (K(d) on the order of magnitude of 10-100 microm) to this region of rabphilin-3 alone (amino acids 40-88), whereas additional sequences up to amino acid 178 are needed for high affinity Rab3A binding to rabphilin-3 (K(d) = 10-20 nm). In contrast, an N-terminal alpha-helix motif in aczonin, with sequence similarity to the Rab3-binding site of Rim1, did not bind Rab3A, -C, or -D or several other Rab proteins. These results were qualitatively confirmed in pull-down experiments with native, prenylated Rab3 from brain lysate in Triton X-100. Munc13 bound to the zinc finger domain of Rim1 but not to the rabphilin-3 or aczonin zinc fingers. Pull-down experiments from brain lysate in the presence of cholate as detergent detected binding to downstream Rim1 sequences, between amino acids 56 and 387, of syntaxin and of Rab3.

By virtue of its interaction with these effector proteins CD22 modulates signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor. To define further the molecular mechanism by which CD22 mediates its co-receptor function, phosphopeptide mapping experiments were conducted to determine which of the six tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are involved in recruitment of the stimulatory effector proteins phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, and Syk. The results obtained indicate that the protein tyrosine kinase Syk interacts with multiple CD22-derived phosphopeptides in both immunoprecipitation and reverse Far Western assays. In contrast, the Grb2.Sos complex was observed to bind exclusively to the fourth phosphotyrosine motif (Y828ENV) from CD22 and does so via a direct interaction based on Far Western and reverse Far Western blotting. Although both PLCgamma and PI3K were observed to bind to multiple phosphopeptides in precipitation experiments, subsequent studies using reverse Far Western blot analysis demonstrated that only the carboxyl-terminal phosphopeptide of CD22 (Y863VTL) binds directly to either one. This finding suggests that PLCgamma and PI3K may be recruited to CD22 either through a direct interaction with Tyr863 or indirectly through an association with one or more intermediate proteins.",

The first repeat makes direct contact with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) subunits in assembled holoenzyme complexes, whereas the second does not contribute directly to the CDK interface. Although threonine 156 in mouse cyclin D1 is predicted to lie at the carboxyl terminus of the linker peptide that separates the two cyclin folds and is buried within the cyclin subunit, mutation of this residue to alanine has profound effects on the behavior of the derived cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes. CDK4 in complexes with mutant cyclin D1 (T156A or T156E but not T156S) is not phosphorylated by recombinant CDK-activating kinase (CAK) in vitro, fails to undergo activating T-loop phosphorylation in vivo, and remains catalytically inactive and unable to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein. Moreover, when it is ectopically overexpressed in mammalian cells, cyclin D1 (T156A) assembles with CDK4 in the cytoplasm but is not imported into the cell nucleus. CAK phosphorylation is not required for nuclear transport of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes, because complexes containing wild-type cyclin D1 and a CDK4 (T172A) mutant lacking the CAK phosphorylation site are efficiently imported. In contrast, enforced overexpression of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 together with mutant cyclin D1 (T156A)-CDK4 complexes enhanced their nuclear localization. These results suggest that cyclin D1 (T156A or T156E) forms abortive complexes with CDK4 that prevent recognition by CAK and by other cellular factors that are required for their nuclear localization. These properties enable ectopically overexpressed cyclin D1 (T156A), or a more stable T156A/T286A double mutant that is resistant to ubiquitination, to compete with endogenous cyclin D1 in mammalian cells, thereby mobilizing CDK4 into cytoplasmic, catalytically inactive complexes and dominantly inhibiting the ability of transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts to enter S phase.",

Rb proteins control cell-cycle progression by sequestering transcription factors required for entry into S-phase, suggesting that the virus modifies the cellular environment to produce conditions suitable for viral DNA replication. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we have investigated whether the complementary-sense gene products of bean yellow dwarf virus, a mastrevirus that is adapted to dicotyledonous plants, also bind maize Rb protein. We demonstrate that whereas RepA binds to Rb protein, Rep does not, suggesting that RepA alone regulates host gene expression and progression of cells to S-phase. RepA mutants containing L --> I, C --> S, C --> G, and E --> Q mutations within the consensus Rb protein binding motif LXCXE retained the ability to bind to Rb, but with reduced efficiency. Most notably, the E --> Q mutation reduced binding by approximately 95%. Nonetheless, all LXCXE mutants were able to replicate in tobacco protoplasts and to systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana and bean, in which they produced wild-type symptoms.",

To determine whether p53 exerts a direct influence on nuclear DNA replication, purified human p53 was added to a transcription-free DNA replication extract from Xenopus eggs. Full-length human p53 that inhibits SV40 DNA replication in vitro had no effect on nuclear DNA synthesis in the Xenopus system. In contrast, a C-terminal truncated form of p53 (p53 delta 30), which is constitutively active for DNA binding and similar to an alternately spliced form found in vivo, showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA replication in both the soluble SV40 system and eukaryotic nuclei. This inhibition occurred primarily at initiation of DNA synthesis. Oxidation of p53 delta 30, which eliminates DNA binding activity, also abrogated the protein's ability to inhibit nuclear DNA synthesis. The p53 binding DNA consensus sequence enhanced rather than competed away inhibitory activity of p53 delta 30. Therefore, p53 that is constitutively active for DNA binding can inhibit nuclear DNA replication in the absence of transcription. This inhibition may require binding of p53 to DNA, in addition to interactions between p53 and proteins of the replication complex.",

Here we report support for a rationale to target IKBKE, an I\u03baB kinase family member that activates the AKT and NF-\u03baB pathways, as one strategy to address NSCLC resistant to EGFR inhibitors. While wild-type and mutant EGFR directly interacted with IKBKE, only mutant EGFR phosphorylated IKBKE on residues Y153 and Y179. The unphosphorylatable mutant IKBKE-Y153F/Y179-F that lost kinase activity failed to activate AKT and inhibited EGFR signaling. In clinical specimens of NSCLC with activating mutations of EGFR, we observed elevated levels of phospho-Y153 IKBKE. IKBKE ablation with shRNA or small-molecule inhibitor amlexanox selectively inhibited the viability of NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations in vitro In parallel, we found that these treatments activated the MAPK pathway due to attenuation of an IKBKE feedback mechanism. In vivo studies revealed that combining amlexanox with MEK inhibitor AZD6244 significantly inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of NSCLC cells harboring activating EGFR mutations, including EGFR(T790M) Overall, our findings define IKBKE as a direct effector target of EGFR and provide a therapeutic rationale to target IKBKE as a strategy to eradicate EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells.

The severity of the disease is mainly determined by the copy number of SMN2, a copy gene which predominantly produces exon 7-skipped transcripts and only low amount of full-length transcripts that encode for a protein identical to SMN1. Only about 4% of SMA patients bear one SMN1 copy with an intragenic mutation. A comprehensive molecular genetic analysis of 34 SMA patients who carry one SMN1 gene is presented, including 18 that were previously published. Haplotype analysis with the microsatellite markers Ag1-CA and C212 in these SMA families turned out to be a reliable accessory method in predicting known SMN1 mutations in SMA patients carrying one SMN1 copy. Five novel missense mutations were identified that are localized in: exon 2a c.88G>A (p.D30N) and c.131A>T (p.D44V); exon 3 c.283G>C (p.G95R) and c.332C>G (p.A111G); and exon 6 c.784A>G (p.S262G), respectively. The survival motor neuron (SMN) protein has been shown to be a component of a large complex (termed the SMN complex) that promotes the formation of spliceosomal U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Within this complex, SMN forms oligomers and directly interacts via its N-terminus with SMN-interacting protein 1 (SIP1) and via its central Tudor domain with spliceosomal (Sm) proteins. We performed in vitro interaction studies to test whether SMA-causing missense mutations identified in this study interfere with the reported interactions of SMN. Our results show that mutations p.G95R and p.A111G reduce SMN binding to Sm proteins, further confirming the previous finding that the Tudor domain is the essential binding site of SMN to Sm-proteins. However, all mutations, including those in exon 2a, a region shown to be important for the binding of SMN to SIP1, do not disturb the interaction of SMN to SIP1.",

In addition to the previously identified c-kit gene product (Kit+), a second normal Kit isoform (KitA+) containing an in-frame insertion, Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys, within the extracellular domain, was detected in murine mast cell cultures and mid-gestation placenta. Both Kit+ and KitA+ isoforms showed increased autophosphorylation and enhanced association with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3' kinase and PLC gamma 1, when stimulated with recombinant soluble Steel factor. No association or increase in phosphorylation of GAP and two GAP-associated proteins, p62 and p190, was observed. The two isoforms had distinct activities in the absence of exogenous soluble Steel factor; Kit+, but not KitA+, showed constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation that was accompanied by a low constitutive level of association with PI-3' kinase and PLC gamma 1. Introduction of the point substitutions associated with W37 (Glu582----Lys) or W41 (Val831----Met) mutant alleles into c-kit expression constructs abolished (W37) or reduced (W41) the Steel factor-induced association of the Kit receptor with signalling proteins in a manner proportional to the overall severity of the corresponding W mutant phenotype.

Using the crystal structure as a guide, we have inactivated the LXCXE-binding pocket by replacing N757 with Phe [to obtain RB(N757F)]. RB(N757F) does not bind to viral oncoproteins but retains the ability to bind and inhibit E2F. RB(N757F) is less effective than the wild-type RB [RB(WT)] in repressing E2F-regulated transcription, and its repression activity is not affected by trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. However, RB(N757F) is as effective as RB(WT) in suppressing cell growth. Interestingly, RB(N757F) cannot establish an irreversible growth arrest in differentiated myocytes. Differentiated myocytes with RB(WT) become refractory to serum. By contrast, differentiated myocytes with RB(N757F) undergo DNA synthesis and phosphorylate RB(N757F) in response to serum, despite a high level of p21Cip1 expression. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites in RB(N757F) rescued its defect and allowed myocytes to permanently withdraw from the cell cycle. These results demonstrate that it is possible to inactivate the LXCXE-binding pocket without compromising the overall integrity of RB. Moreover, the LXCXE-binding pocket is dispensable for the intrinsic growth suppression function of RB. However, the LXCXE-binding function is essential for RB to establish the serum-refractory state in differentiated myocytes.",

In platelet-type von Willebrand disease, two mutations, G233V and M239V, have been described within the Cys209-Cys248 disulfide loop of GPIbalpha that compromise hemostasis by increasing the affinity for vWF. We have earlier shown that converting other residues in this region to valine alters the affinity of GPIbalpha for vWF, with mutations K237V and Q232V, respectively, showing the greatest increase and decrease in affinity. Here, we investigated further the effect of these two mutations on the kinetics of the GPIbalpha interaction with the vWF-A1 domain under dynamic flow conditions. We measured the cellular on- and off-rate constants of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing GPIb-IX complexes containing wild-type or mutant GPIbalpha interacting with vWF-A1-coated surfaces at different shear stresses. We found that the gain-of-function mutant, K237V, rolled very slowly and continuously on vWF-A1 surface while the loss-of-function mutant, Q232V, showed fast, saltatory movement compared to the wild-type (WT). The off-rate constants, calculated based on the analysis of lifetimes of transient tethers formed on surfaces coated with limiting densities of vWF-A1, revealed that the Q232V and K237V dissociated 1.25-fold faster and 2.2-fold slower than the WT. The cellular on-rate constant of WT, measured in terms of tethering frequency, was threefold more and threefold less than Q232V and K237V, respectively. Thus, the gain- and loss-of-function mutations in GPIbalpha affect both the association and dissociation kinetics of the GPIbalpha-vWF-A1 bond. These findings are in contrast to the functionally similar selectin bonds where some of the mutations have been reported to affect only the dissociation rate.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate cAMP-mediated ENaC regulation in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing the three subunits (alphabetagamma) of rat ENaC and to determine the ENaC regions important for mediating the stimulatory effect of cAMP. In oocytes treated for about 24 h with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 1 microm forskolin (FSK) so as to increase intracellular cAMP, the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current (DeltaI(Ami)) was on average 10-fold larger than DeltaI(Ami) in matched control oocytes. This effect on DeltaI(Ami) was paralleled by an increase in ENaC surface expression caused by a reduced rate of ENaC retrieval. In addition, IBMX/FSK also enhanced ENaC open probability from about 0.2 to 0.5. The stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK was dependent on the presence of intact PY motifs in the C termini of the channel. Mutagenesis of putative protein kinase A and CK-2 consensus motifs in the cytosolic domains of the channel did not reveal critical sites involved in mediating the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis of two putative ERK-consensus motifs (T613A in betaENaC and T623A in gammaENaC) largely reduced the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. Phosphorylation of these ERK sites has previously been reported to enhance the interaction of ENaC and Nedd4 (Shi, H., Asher, C., Chigaev, A., Yung, Y., Reuveny, E., Seger, R., and Garty, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 13539-13547). Using co-expression experiments we demonstrated that mutating the two ERK sites attenuates the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC currents. We conclude that an increase in intracellular cAMP favors the dephosphorylation of the two ERK sites, which reduces channel retrieval and increases P(O) by modulating ENaC/Nedd4 interaction. This defines a novel regulatory pathway likely to be relevant for cAMP-induced stimulation of ENaC in vivo.",

We sought to determine how arrestin2 binds to LH/CG R, if binding is of high affinity, and if the receptor also binds arrestin3. Desensitization of intact LH/CG R was equally sensitive to ectopic constructs of arrestin2 that bind other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) either in a phosphorylation-independent or -dependent manner. Intact LH/CG R was not desensitized by ectopic arrestin3 constructs. Surface plasmon resonance studies showed that arrestin2 bound a synthetic third intracellular (3i) LH/CG R loop peptide with picomolar affinity; arrestin3 bound with millimolar affinity. To determine whether Asp-564 in the 3i loop mimicked the phosphorylated residue of other GPCRs, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) and D564G LH/CG R. An agonist-stimulated ARF6-dependent arrestin2 undocking pathway to drive desensitization of WT receptor was recapitulated in HEK cell membranes, and ectopic arrestin2 promoted desensitization of WT LH/CG R. However, D564G LH/CG R in HEK cells was not desensitized, and synthetic 3i D564G peptide did not bind arrestin2. Synthetic 3i loop peptides containing D564E, D564V, or D564N also did not bind arrestin2. We conclude that the ARF6-mediated mechanism to release a pool of membrane-delimited arrestin to bind GPCRs may be a widespread mechanism to deliver arrestin to GPCRs for receptor desensitization. Unlike other GPCRs that additionally require receptor phosphorylation, LH/CG R activation is sufficient to expose a conformation in which Asp-564 in the 3i loop confers high affinity binding selectively to arrestin2.",

We studied the role of alpha-chain in IL-2 binding to the high affinity receptor using IL-2 analog Lys20 which was made by the substitution of Lys for Asp20 of wild-type rIL-2. Lys20 bound to MT-1 cells solely expressing alpha-chain at low affinity, but did not bind to YT-2C2 cells which solely expressed beta-chain. However, direct binding of radiolabeled Lys20 to ED515-D cells, an HTLV-I-infected and IL-2-dependent T cell line, revealed both high affinity and low affinity binding although the Kd value of high affinity binding was 50 to 100 times higher than that of the high affinity binding of wild-type rIL-2. High affinity binding of Lys20 was completely blocked by 2R-B mAb recognizing IL-2R beta-chain. Anti-Tac mAb recognizing IL-2R alpha-chain abolished all of the specific Lys20 bindings. In contrast to the replacement of cell bound 2R-B mAb with wild-type rIL-2 at 37 degrees C, the addition of an excess of Lys20 did not cause the detachment of cell-bound radiolabeled or FITC-labeled 2R-B mAb. Consistent with the results of binding studies, Lys20 induced the proliferation of ED515-D cells, but not large granular lymphocyte leukemic cells. The growth of ED-515D cells was completely suppressed by either anti-Tac mAb or 2R-B mAb. These results strongly suggest that coexpression of the IL-2R alpha- and beta-chains alters the binding affinity of Lys20 and that the interaction between IL-2 and the alpha-chain is a key event in the formation of the IL-2/IL-2R ternary complex.",

High yield, specific labeling of the AT1 receptor was obtained with the 125I-[Sar1,Bpa8]AngII analog. Digestion of the covalent 125I-[Sar1,Bpa8]AngII-AT1 complex with V8 protease generated two major fragments of 15.8 kDa and 17.8 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Treatment of the [Sar1,Bpa8]AngII-AT1 complex with cyanogen bromide produced a major fragment of 7.5 kDa which, upon further digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, generated a fragment of 3.6 kDa. Since the 7.5-kDa fragment was sensitive to hydrolysis by 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid, we circumscribed the labeling site of 125I-[Sar1,Bpa8]AngII within amino acids 285 and 295 of the AT1 receptor. When the AT1 receptor was photolabeled with 125I-[Bpa1]AngII, a poor incorporation yield was obtained. Cleavage of the labeled receptor with endoproteinase Lys-C produced a glycopeptide of 31 kDa, which upon deglycosylation showed an apparent molecular mass of 7.5 kDa, delimiting the labeling site of 125I-[Bpa1]AngII within amino acids 147 and 199 of the AT1 receptor. CNBr digestion of the hAT1 I165M mutant receptor narrowed down the labeling site to the fragment 166-199.

Rad54 protein and Rad54-K341R, a mutant protein defective in the Walker A box ATP-binding fold, were fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and purified to near homogeneity. In vivo, GST-Rad54 protein carried out the functions required for methyl methanesulfonate sulfate (MMS), UV, and DSB repair. In vitro, GST-Rad54 protein exhibited dsDNA-specific ATPase activity. Rad54 protein stimulated Rad51/Rpa-mediated DNA strand exchange by specifically increasing the kinetics of joint molecule formation.

Our results suggest that Rad54 protein interacts specifically with established Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments before homology search on the duplex DNA and heteroduplex DNA formation.

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairment in social communication/interaction and inflexible/repetitive behavior. Several lines of evidence support genetic factors as a predominant cause of ASD. Among those autism susceptibility genes that have been identified, the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, initially identified as predisposing to Cowden heritable cancer syndrome, was found to be mutated in a subset of ASD patients with extreme macrocephaly. However, the ASD-relevant molecular mechanism mediating the effect of PTEN mutations remains elusive. METHODS: We developed a Pten knock-in murine model to study the effects of Pten germline mutations, specifically altering subcellular localization, in ASD. Proteins were isolated from the hemispheres of the male littermates, and Western blots were performed to determine protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Immunohistochemical stains were carried out to validate the localization of TH and dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). PC12 cells ectopically expressing either wild-type or missense mutant PTEN were then compared for the differences in TH expression. RESULTS: Mice carrying Pten mutations have high TH and D2R in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. They also have increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and TH. Mechanistically, PTEN downregulates TH production in PC12 cells via inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/CREB signaling pathway, while PTEN reduces TH phosphorylation via suppressing MAPK pathway. Unlike wild-type PTEN but similar to the mouse knock-in mutant Pten, three naturally occurring missense mutations of PTEN that we previously identified in ASD patients, H93R, F241S, and D252G, were not able to suppress TH when overexpressed in PC12 cells. In addition, two other PTEN missense mutations, C124S (pan phosphatase dead) and G129E (lipid phosphatase dead), failed to suppress TH when ectopically expressed in PC12 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal a non-canonical PTEN-TH pathway in the brain that may work as a core regulator of dopamine signaling, which when dysfunctional is pathogenic in ASD.",

We have carried out a systematic study investigating in a heterologous expression system, the association of the four major NMDA receptor subtypes with the PSD-95 family of MAGUK proteins, chapsyn-110, PSD-95, synapse associated protein (SAP) 97 and SAP102. We report that although each PSD-95 MAGUK was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B, NR1/NR2C and NR1/NR2D receptor subtypes, they elicited differential effects with regard to the enhancement of total NR2 subunit expression which then results in an increased cell surface expression of NMDA receptor subtypes. PSD-95 and chapsyn-110 enhanced NR2A and NR2B total expression which resulted in increased NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptor cell surface expression whereas SAP97 and SAP102 had no effect on total or cell surface expression of these subtypes. PSD-95, chapsyn-110, SAP97 and SAP102 had no effect on either total NR2C and NR2D subunit expression or cell surface NR1/NR2C and NR1/NR2D expression. A comparison of PSD-95alpha, PSD-95beta and PSD-95alpha(C3S,C5S) showed that PSD-95-enhanced cell surface expression of NR1/NR2A receptors was dependent upon the PSD-95 N-terminal C3,C5 cysteines. These observations support differential interaction of NMDA receptor subtypes with different PSD-95 MAGUK scaffolding proteins. This has implications for the stabilisation, turnover and compartmentalisation of NMDA receptor subtypes in neurones during development and in the mature brain.",

In that system, three ATP molecules bound to the Rfc2, Rfc3, and Rfc4 subunits are necessary and sufficient for efficient loading of PCNA, whereas ATP binding to Rfc1 is not required.

The presence of exon 8b in the B2-Raf(8b) isoform and exon 9b in the B3-Raf(9b) isoform differentially regulates B-Raf by decreasing and increasing MEK activating and oncogenic activities, respectively. Using different cell systems, we investigated here the molecular basis of this regulation. We show that exons 8b and 9b interfere with the ability of the B-Raf N-terminal region to interact with and inhibit the C-terminal kinase domain, thus modulating the autoinhibition mechanism in an opposite manner. Exons 8b and 9b are flanked by two residues reported to down-regulate B-Raf activity upon phosphorylation. The S365A mutation increased the activity of all B-Raf isoforms, but the effect on B2-Raf(8b) was more pronounced. This was correlated to the high level of S365 phosphorylation in this isoform, whereas the B3-Raf(9b) isoform was poorly phosphorylated on this residue. In contrast, S429 was equally phosphorylated in all B-Raf isoforms, but the S429A mutation activated B2-Raf(8b), whereas it inhibited B3-Raf(9b). These results indicate that phosphorylation on both S365 and S429 participate in the differential regulation of B-Raf isoforms through distinct mechanisms. Finally, we show that autoinhibition and phosphorylation represent independent but convergent mechanisms accounting for B-Raf regulation by alternative splicing.",

The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43).

Here, we identified SHP-2 to be phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues in response to different stimuli and unmasked the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine 584 as a major phosphorylation site in human cell lines. Tyrosine 584 shares, together with tyrosine 546, the consensus sequence pY-X-N-X, a characteristic of potential binding sites for the SH2 domain of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). We show here that mutation of tyrosine 584, but not tyrosine 546, to phenylalanine totally abolished the binding of Grb2 to SHP-2. By using a systematic mutagenesis approach, phosphorylation of additional tyrosines in each of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 was detected after coexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor, but not after coexpression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, whereas tyrosine 263 located in the interspace between SH2 and catalytic domain appears to be exclusively recognized by platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Immunoprecipitation of SHP-2 from a panel of mammary carcinoma cell lines copurifies several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins; the most prominent band has an apparent molecular weight of M(r) 115,000.",

Crystal structures of several homomeric protein kinase complexes have a serine, threonine, or tyrosine autophosphorylation site of one kinase monomer located in the active site of another monomer, a structural complex that we call an \"autophosphorylation complex.\" We developed and applied a structural bioinformatics method to identify all such autophosphorylation complexes in x-ray crystallographic structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We identified 15 autophosphorylation complexes in the PDB, of which five complexes had not previously been described in the publications describing the crystal structures. These five complexes consist of tyrosine residues in the N-terminal juxtamembrane regions of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R, Tyr(561)) and ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2, Tyr(594)), tyrosine residues in the activation loops of the SRC kinase family member LCK (Tyr(394)) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R, Tyr(1166)), and a serine in a nuclear localization signal region of CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2, Ser(142)). Mutations in the complex interface may alter autophosphorylation activity and contribute to disease; therefore, we mutated residues in the autophosphorylation complex interface of LCK and found that two mutations impaired autophosphorylation (T445V and N446A) and mutation of Pro(447) to Ala, Gly, or Leu increased autophosphorylation. The identified autophosphorylation sites are conserved in many kinases, suggesting that, by homology, these complexes may provide insight into autophosphorylation complex interfaces of kinases that are relevant drug targets.",

Its primary function is the rapid activation of Ca2+ release from cytoplasmic stores in a process called excitation-contraction coupling. To study the role of alpha1S-beta1a interactions in the incorporation of the functional channel complex into the triad, alpha1S and beta1a [or a beta1a-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein] were expressed alone and in combination in myotubes of the dysgenic cell line GLT. betaGFP expressed in dysgenic myotubes that lack the skeletal muscle alpha1S subunit was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. On coexpression with the alpha1S subunit betaGFP distribution became clustered and colocalized with alpha1S immunofluorescence. Based on the colocalization of betaGFP and alpha1S with the ryanodine receptor the clusters were identified as T-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions. Expression of alpha1S with and without beta1a restored Ca2+ currents and depolarization-induced Ca2+ release. The translocation of betaGFP from the cytoplasm into the junctions failed when betaGFP was coexpressed with alpha1S mutants in which the beta interaction domain had been altered (alpha1S-Y366S) or deleted (alpha1S-Delta351-380). Although alpha1S-Y366S did not associate with betaGFP it was incorporated into the junctions, and it restored Ca2+ currents and depolarization-induced Ca2+ release. Thus, beta1a requires the association with the beta interaction domain in the I-II cytoplasmic loop of alpha1S for its own incorporation into triad junctions, but stable alpha1S-beta1a association is not necessary for the targeting of alpha1S into the triads or for its normal function in Ca2+ conductance and excitation-contraction coupling.",

Tax activity is mediated by interaction with cellular transcription factors including members of the CREB/ATF family, the NF-kappaB/c-Rel family, serum response factor, and the coactivators CREB binding protein-p300. Although p53 is usually not mutated in HTLV-1-infected T cells, its half-life is increased and its function is impaired. Here we report that transient coexpression of p53 and Tax results in the suppression of p53 transcriptional activity. Expression of Tax abrogates p53-induced G1 arrest in the Calu-6 cell line and prevents the apoptosis induced by overexpressing p53 in the HeLa/Tat cell line. The Tax mutants M22 and G148V, which selectively activate the CREB/ATF pathway, exert these same biological effects on p53 function. In contrast, the NF-kappaB-active Tax mutant M47 has no effect on p53 activity in any of these systems. Consistent with the negative effect of Tax on p53, no activity on a p53-responsive promoter was observed upon transfection of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. The p53 protein is expressed at high levels in the nucleus, and nuclear extracts of HTLV-1-infected T cells bind constitutively to a DNA oligonucleotide containing the p53 response element, indicating that Tax does not interfere with p53 binding to DNA. Tax is able to suppress the transactivation function of p53 in three different cell lines, and this suppression required Tax-mediated activation of the CREB/ATF, but not the NF-kappaB/c-Rel, pathway. Tax and the active Tax mutants were able to abrogate the G1 arrest and apoptosis induced by p53, and this effect does not correlate with an altered localization of nuclear p53 or with the disruption of p53-DNA complexes. The suppression of p53 activity by Tax could be important in T-cell immortalization induced by HTLV-1.",

Both proteins have proposed roles during long-term potentiation and long-term depression in the delivery and anchorage of AMPA receptors at synapses. Here we report a variant of ABP-L (seven PDZ form of ABP) called pABP-L that is palmitoylated at a cysteine residue at position 11 within a novel 18 amino acid N-terminal leader sequence encoded through differential splicing. In cultured hippocampal neurons, nonpalmitoylated ABP-L localizes with internal GluR2 pools expressed from a Sindbis virus vector, whereas pABP-L is membrane targeted and associates with surface-localized GluR2 receptors at the plasma membrane in spines. Mutation of Cys-11 to alanine blocks the palmitoylation of pABP-L and targets the protein to intracellular clusters, confirming that targeting the protein to spines is dependent on palmitoylation. Non-palmitoylated GRIP is primarily intracellular, but a chimera with the pABP-L N-terminal palmitoylation sequence linked to the body of the GRIP protein is targeted to spines. We suggest that pABP-L and ABP-L provide, respectively, synaptic and intracellular sites for the anchorage of AMPA receptors during receptor trafficking to and from the synapse.",

We found that mutation of Cys-614 or Cys-666 to Ala inhibited expression of the exchanger protein in HEK-293 cells, but not in an in vitro translation system. We speculated that Cys-614 and Cys-666 might form an extracellular disulfide bond that stabilized protein structure. Such an arrangement would place the C terminus of the exchanger outside the cell, contrary to the original topological model. This hypothesis was tested by adding a hemagglutinin A epitope to the C terminus of the protein. The hemagglutinin A epitope could be recognized with a specific antibody without permeabilization of the cell membrane, supporting an extracellular location for the C terminus. Additionally, the exchanger molecule could be labeled with biotin maleimide only following extracellular application of beta-mercaptoethanol. Surprisingly, mutation of Cys-395, located in the large intracellular loop, to Ala, prevented reduction-dependent labeling of the protein. The activity of wild-type exchanger, but not the Cys-395 --> Ala mutant, was stimulated after application of beta-mercaptoethanol. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated self-association between wild-type and FLAG-tagged exchanger proteins that could not be inhibited by Cys-395 --> Ala mutation. These results suggest that NCKX2 associates as a dimer, an interaction that does not require, but may be stabilized by, a disulfide linkage through Cys-395. This linkage, perhaps by limiting protein mobility along the dimer interface, reduces the transport activity of NCKX2.",

As previously reported, we confirmed in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) that histamine and thrombin increased intracellular Ca(2+) whereas adenosine and salbutamol did not, and that these four agonists caused different effects on actin filament structure. Nevertheless, despite their divergent effects on intracellular Ca(2+) and on actin filament structure, we found by immunoprecipitation that adenosine, histamine, salbutamol and thrombin all caused an increase in association between eNOS and globular actin. This increase of association was inhibited by pre-treatment with phalloidin, an actin filament stabilizer. All of these agonists also increased phosphorylation of eNOS on serine residue 1177, eNOS activity, and cyclic guanosine-3', 5'-monophosphate, and these increases were all attenuated by phalloidin. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of eNOS on serine 1177 was attenuated by Akt inhibition, whereas association of eNOS with actin was not. We also found, in HEK-293 cells transfected with the eNOS mutants eNOS-S1177A or eNOS-S1177D, that the association between eNOS and globular actin was decreased as compared to cells transfected with wild-type eNOS.

In addition to mutations in at least four genes--LIS1, DCX, ARX and RELN--mutations in a human alpha-tubulin gene, TUBA1A, have recently been identified that cause these diseases. Here, we show that one such mutation, R264C, leads to a diminished capacity of de novo tubulin heterodimer formation. We identify the mechanisms that contribute to this defect. First, there is a reduced efficiency whereby quasinative alpha-tubulin folding intermediates are generated via ATP-dependent interaction with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT. Second, there is a failure of CCT-generated folding intermediates to stably interact with TBCB, one of the five tubulin chaperones (TBCA-E) that participate in the pathway leading to the de novo assembly of the tubulin heterodimer. We describe the behavior of the R264C mutation in terms of its effect on the structural integrity of alpha-tubulin and its interaction with TBCB. In spite of its compromised folding efficiency, R264C molecules that do productively assemble into heterodimers are capable of copolymerizing into dynamic microtubules in vivo. The diminished production of TUBA1A tubulin in R264C individuals is consistent with haploinsufficiency as a cause of the disease phenotype.",

MSH2-MSH6 binds to mismatch substrates and displays an ATPase activity that is modulated by mispairs that are repaired in vivo. To understand early steps in mismatch repair, we analyzed mismatch repair (MMR) defective MSH2-msh6-F337A and MSH2-msh6-340 complexes that contained amino acid substitutions in the MSH6 mismatch recognition domain. While both heterodimers were defective in forming stable complexes with mismatch substrates, only MSH2-msh6-340 bound to homoduplex DNA with an affinity that was similar to that observed for MSH2-MSH6. Additional analyses suggested that stable binding to a mispair is not sufficient to initiate recruitment of downstream repair factors. Previously, we observed that MSH2-MSH6 forms a stable complex with a palindromic insertion mismatch that escapes correction by MMR in vivo. Here we show that this binding is not accompanied by either a modulation in MSH2-MSH6 ATPase activity or an ATP-dependent recruitment of the MLH1-PMS1 complex. Together, these observations suggest that early stages in MMR can be divided into distinct recognition, stable binding, and downstream factor recruitment steps.",

LTA also ADP-ribosylates simple guanidino compounds (e.g., arginine) and catalyzes its own auto-ADP-ribosylation. All LTA-catalyzed reactions are enhanced by ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Replacement of arginine-7 (R7K), valine-53 (V53D), serine-63 (S63K), valine 97 (V97K), or tyrosine-104 (Y104K) in LTA resulted in fully assembled but nontoxic proteins. S63K, V53D, and R7K are catalytic-site mutations, whereas V97K and Y104K are amino acid replacements adjacent to and outside of the catalytic site, respectively. The effects of mutagenesis were quantified by measuring ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (i.e., auto-ADP-ribosylation and ADP-ribosylagmatine synthesis) and interaction with ARF (i.e., inhibition of ARF-stimulated cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and effects of ARF on mutant auto-ADP-ribosylation). All mutants were inactive in the ADP-ribosyltransferase assay; however, auto-ADP-ribosylation in the presence of recombinant human ARF6 was detected, albeit much less than that of native LT (Y104K > V53D > V97K > R7K, S63K). Based on the lack of inhibition by free ADP-ribose, the observed auto-ADP-ribosylation activity was enzymatic and not due to the nonenzymatic addition of free ADP-ribose. V53D, S63K, and R7K were more effective than Y104K or V97K in blocking ARF stimulation of cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase. Based on these data, it appears that ARF-binding and catalytic sites are not identical and that a region outside the NAD cleft may participate in the LTA-ARF interaction.",

In this study, we used the TOXCAT assay to probe the Ib\u03b2 TM domain dimerization interface by Ala- and Leu-scanning mutagenesis. Our results show that this interface is based on a leucine zipper-like heptad repeat pattern of amino acids. Mutating either one of polar residues Gln129 or His139 to Leu or Ala disrupted Ib\u03b2 TM dimerization dramatically, indicating that polar residues might form part of the leucine zipper-based dimerization interface. Furthermore, these specific mutational effects in the TOXCAT assay were confirmed in the thiol-disulfide exchange and SDS-PAGE assays. The computational modeling studies further revealed that the most likely leucine zipper interface involves hydrogen bonding of Gln129 and electrostatic interaction of the His139 side chain. Correlation of computer modeling results with experimental mutagenesis studies on the Ib\u03b2 TM domain may provide insights for understanding the role of the association of TM domains on the assembly of GP Ib-IX complex.",

A rabbit LEC line, N/N1003A, was grown in the absence or presence of LEDGF. PKC gamma protein was translocated from the cytosolic fractions to the membrane fractions upon addition of LEDGF at 10 ng ml(-1). In whole cell extracts of N/N1003A cells, co-immunoprecipitation assays showed a protein-protein interaction between PKC gamma and Connexin 43. In the presence of LEDGF the activation of PKC gamma enhanced the phosphorylation of Connexin 43 by four-fold compared to the absence of LEDGF. The addition of LEDGF for 30 min resulted in a 65% decrease in gap junction Connexin 43 at the cell surface and a 70% decrease in gap junction activity. These results suggest that the activation of PKC gamma by LEDGF plays a major role in gap junction assembly/disassembly, which may enhance survival of LECs against osmolarity-stress induced by high sugar concentration.",

We recently showed that the addition of recombinant ARNO promotes binding of beta-arrestin1 to the third intracellular (3i) loop of the active LH/CG receptor, thereby reducing the ability of the receptor to activate the stimulatory G protein and signal to adenylyl cyclase. In the present report we determined whether ARNO is detectable in follicular membranes and whether the catalytically inactive E156K ARNO mutant, containing a mutation in the Sec7 domain, can act in a dominant negative manner to block LH/CG receptor desensitization. Results show that ARNO is readily detected in follicular membranes and that levels of membrane-associated ARNO increase with follicular maturation. The addition of catalytically inactive E156K ARNO blocks both the release of beta-arrestin1 from its membrane docking site, based on Western blot analysis, and development of LH/CG receptor desensitization. We also investigated whether a point mutation in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ARNO (R280D), which blocks binding of phosphoinositides like phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) but not catalytic activity, disrupts LH/CG receptor desensitization. R280D ARNO neither promotes nor inhibits LH/CG receptor desensitization, consistent with a requirement of the PH domain of ARNO for its association with the plasma membrane. LH/CG receptor activation of ARNO is not mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) or by G protein beta gamma subunits. Taken together, these results suggest that LH/CG receptor promotes beta-arrestin1 release from its membrane docking site to bind to the 3i loop of the LH/CG receptor via activation of membrane delimited endogenous ARNO. As ARNO activation is independent of PI 3-kinase and G beta gamma, our results are consistent with a role for PIP(2) in receptor-stimulated ARNO activation.",

We have studied the signaling, activation, and potential function of these related enzymes in GN4 rat liver epithelial cells that express CADTK and p125(FAK) at roughly similar levels. p125(FAK) is nearly fully tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting GN4 cells. In contrast, while CADTK is not tyrosine-autophosphorylated in untreated cells, angiotensin II increases CADTK Tyr(P) by 5-10-fold. With regard to signaling, CADTK activation is correlated with stimulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p70(S6K) pathways but not with the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or p90(RSK). In this report we assessed the contribution of CADTK and p125(FAK) to tyrosine phosphorylation of focal contact proteins. In adherent GN4 cells, the constitutive activity of p125(FAK) was correlated with basal paxillin, tensin, and p130(CAS) tyrosine phosphorylation. A rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of each protein was detected after treatment with angiotensin II or other agonists that stimulate CADTK; the prolonged 3-4-fold increase in paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was the most substantial change. In the WB cell line that expresses 3-fold less CADTK than GN4 cell line agonist-dependent paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation is similarly reduced. Immunoprecipitation of CADTK from GN4 cells revealed CADTK. paxillin complexes that persisted in 500 mM NaCl but not in 0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer. The complexes were largely independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of either protein. Surprisingly, we did not detect p125(FAK).paxillin complexes in immunoprecipitates using either of two p125(FAK) antibodies. When CADTK and p125(FAK) were transiently overexpressed in 293(T) cells, both enzymes associated with paxillin, but the avidity of CADTK appeared to be greater. In addition, in transfected 293(T) cells, complexes between CADTK and another potential substrate, p130(CAS), were detected. In summary, in GN4 rat liver epithelial cells stimulation of CADTK was highly correlated with paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation; in addition, CADTK but not p125(FAK) was complexed to paxillin at detectable levels. This suggests that agonist-dependent cytoskeletal changes in epithelial cells might proceed, in part, by CADTK-dependent mechanisms.",

Under conditions where IRbeta autophosphorylates, substitution of Y1322F and M1325P in IRbeta resulted in the abolition of p85 binding to the IRbeta, confirming that the p85 subunit of PI3K binds to Y1322. The binding site for p85 on IRbeta was also confirmed in the yeast three-hybrid system. Using the C-terminal region of IRbeta (amino acids 1293-1343 encompassing the YHTM motif) as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to yeast cells, we determined that the IRbeta-pYTHM motif interacts with p85. We also used retinal organ cultures to demonstrate insulin activation of the insulin receptor and subsequent binding of p85, measured through GST pull-down assays with p85 fusion proteins. Further, the Y960F mutant insulin receptor, which does not bind IRS-1, is capable of bringing down PI3K activity from retina lysates. On the other hand, in response to insulin, IRS-2 is able to interact with the p85 subunit of PI3K in the retina. These results suggest that multiple signaling pathways could regulate the PI3K activity and subsequent activation of Akt in the retina.",

However, heterozygous gamma2(+/-) gene deletion mice are seizure free, suggesting that the loss of one GABRG2 allele alone in heterozygous patients may not be sufficient to produce epilepsy. Here we show that the mutant gamma2 subunit was immature and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). With heterozygous coexpression of gamma2S/gamma2S(Q351X) subunits and alpha1 and beta2 subunits, the trafficking deficient mutant gamma2 subunit reduced trafficking of wild-type partnering subunits, which was not seen in the hemizygous gene deletion control. Consequently, the function of the heterozygous receptor channel was reduced to less than the hemizygous control and to less than half of the wild-type receptors with a full gene dose. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that in the presence of the mutant gamma2S(Q351X) subunit, wild-type alpha1 subunits degraded more substantially within 1 h of translation. We showed that the basis for this dominant-negative effect on wild-type receptors was due to an interaction between mutant and wild-type subunits. The mutant subunit oligomerized with wild-type subunits and trapped them in the ER, subjecting them to glycosylation arrest and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) through the ubiquitin proteosome system. Thus, we hypothesize that a likely explanation for the GEFS+ phenotype is a dominant-negative suppression of wild-type receptors by the mutant gamma2S subunit in combination with loss of mutant gamma2S subunit protein function.",

During the replication of influenza virus, the vRNP complex undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, during which NP serves as one of the determinants. To date, many phosphorylation sites on NP have been identified, but the biological functions of many of these phosphorylation sites remain unknown. In the present study, the functions of the phosphorylation sites S9, Y10, and Y296 were characterized. These residues are highly conserved, and their phosphorylation was essential for virus growth in cell culture and in a mouse model by regulating the activity of the viral polymerase and the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of NP. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of S9 and Y10 controlled nuclear import of NP by affecting the binding affinity between NP and different isoforms of importin-\u03b1. In addition, the phosphorylation of Y296 caused nuclear retention of NP by reducing the interaction between NP and CRM1. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of NP during the early stage of virus infection was ablated when Y296 was mutated to F. However, at later stages of infection, it was weakened by the Y10F mutation. Taken together, the present data indicate that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of NP control the shuttling of NP between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during virus replication. IMPORTANCE: It is well known that phosphorylation regulates the functions of viral proteins and the life cycle of influenza A virus. As NP is the most abundant protein in the vRNP complex of influenza A virus, several phosphorylation sites on this protein have been identified. However, the functions of these phosphorylation sites were unknown. The present study demonstrates that the phosphorylation status of these sites on NP can mediate its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, which drives the trafficking of vRNP complexes in infected cells. The present data suggest that the phosphorylated residues of NP are multistep controllers of the virus life cycle and new targets for the design of anti-influenza drugs.",

Loss of its protease activity in mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) mice is associated with neurodegeneration. However, the detailed mechanisms by which Omi regulates the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease remain largely unknown. We report here that Omi participates in the pivotal cellular degradation process known as autophagy. It activates autophagy through digestion of Hax-1, a Bcl-2 family-related protein that represses autophagy in a Beclin-1 (mammalian homologue of yeast ATG6)-dependent pathway. Moreover, Omi-induced autophagy facilitates the degradation of neurodegenerative proteins such as pathogenic A53T \u03b1-synuclein and truncated polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, as well as the endogenous autophagy substrate p62. Knockdown of Omi decreases the basal level of autophagy and increases the level of the above target proteins. Furthermore, S276C Omi, the protease-defective mutant found in mnd2 mice, fails to regulate autophagy. Increased autophagy substrates and the formation of aggregate structures are observed in the brains of mnd2 mice. These results identify Omi as a novel regulator of autophagy and suggest that Omi might be important in the cellular quality control of proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Here, we report that the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the Linker for Activation of T-cell (LAT) in human platelets stimulated by FcgammaRIIa cross-linking was followed by its complete dephosphorylation in an alphaIIb/beta3 integrin-dependent manner. Concomitant to LAT dephosphorylation, the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was activated through a mechanism involving its proteolysis by calpains downstream of integrins. Both PTP1B and LAT were associated with the actin cytoskeleton complex formed during platelet aggregation. Moreover, phospho-LAT appeared as a good substrate of activated PTP1B in vitro and these two proteins interacted upon platelet activation by FcgammaRIIa cross-linking. The permeant substrate-trapping PTP1B (TAT-PTP1B D181A) partly inhibited LAT dephosphorylation in human platelets, strongly suggesting that this tyrosine phosphatase was involved in this regulatory pathway. Using a pharmacological inhibitor, we provide evidence that PTP1B activation and LAT dephosphorylation processes were required for irreversible platelet aggregation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PTP1B plays an important role in the integrin-mediated dephosphorylation of LAT in human platelets and is involved in the control of irreversible aggregation upon FcgammaRIIa stimulation.",

However, a \u0394fliH-fliI flhB(P28T) mutant forms some flagella even in the absence of FliH and FliI, raising the question of how FlgN promotes the export of its cognate substrates.

Gaining an understanding of how BDNF, via the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) receptor, elicits specific cellular responses is of contemporary interest. Expression of mutant TrkB in fibroblasts, where tyrosine 484 was changed to phenylalanine, abrogated Shc association with TrkB, but only attenuated and did not block BDNF-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This suggests there is another BDNF-induced signaling mechanism for activating MAPK, which compelled a search for other TrkB substrates. BDNF induces phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) in both fibroblasts engineered to express TrkB and human neuroblastoma (NB) cells that naturally express TrkB. Additionally, BDNF induces phosphorylation of FRS2 in primary cultures of cortical neurons, thus showing that FRS2 is a physiologically relevant substrate of TrkB. Data are presented demonstrating that BDNF induces association of FRS2 with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (GRB2) in cortical neurons, fibroblasts, and NB cells, which in turn could activate the RAS/MAPK pathway. This is not dependent on Shc, since BDNF does not induce association of Shc and FRS2. Finally, the experiments suggest that FRS2 and suc-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target are the same protein.",

In SUR2B, the mutation Y1206S, located at intracellular loop 8, increases the affinity for glibenclamide (GBC) about 10-fold. Here, we examined whether the mutation Y1206S in SUR2A had effects similar to those in SUR2B.2. GBC bound to SUR2A with K(D)=20 nM; the mutation increased affinity approximately 5 x. 3. In cells, coexpression of SUR2A with Kir6.2 increased the affinity for GBC approximately 3 x; with the mutant, the increase was 9 x. 4. The mutation did not affect the affinity of SUR2A for openers; coexpression with Kir6.2 reduced opener affinity of wild-type and mutant SUR2A by about 2 x. 5. The negative allosteric interaction between the opener, P1075, and GBC at wild-type and mutant SUR2A was markedly affected by the presence of MgATP and by coexpression with Kir6.2. 6. In inside-out patches, GBC inhibited the wild-type Kir6.2/SUR2A and 2B channels with IC(50) values of 27 nM; the mutation shifted the IC(50) values to approximately 1 nM. 7. The data show that the mutation Y1206S increased the affinity of SUR2A for GBC and modulated the effects of coexpression. Overall, the changes were similar to those observed with SUR2B(Y1206S), suggesting that the differences in the last 42 carboxy-terminal amino acids of SUR2A and 2B are of limited influence on the binding of GBC and P1075 to the SUR2 isoforms.",

Deletion mutation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments pinpoint dominant PKA phosphorylation sites to serines 43 and 56. PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin significantly decreases its binding to syntaxin-1A in vitro. A syntaphilin mutation of serine 43 to aspartic acid (S43D) shows similar effects on binding. To characterize in vivo phosphorylation events, we generated antisera against a peptide of syntaphilin containing a phosphorylated serine 43. Treatment of rat brain synaptosomes or syntaphilin-transfected HEK 293 cells with the cAMP analogue BIMPS induces in vivo phosphorylation of syntaphilin and inhibits its interaction with syntaxin-1 in neurons. To determine whether PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin is involved in the regulation of Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis, we investigated the effect of overexpression of syntaphilin and its S43D mutant on the regulated secretion of human growth hormone from PC12 cells. Although expression of wild type syntaphilin in PC12 cells exhibits significant reduction in high K(+)-induced human growth hormone release, the S43D mutant fails to inhibit exocytosis.

In this report, we show that CAPN3 degrades p53 and its mutant proteins p53A138V, p53M237I, p53R248W, and p53R273P but not the p53R175H mutant protein. Importantly, we show that Def directly interacts with CAPN3 in the nucleoli and determines the nucleolar localisation of CAPN3, which is a prerequisite for the degradation of p53 in the nucleolus. Furthermore, we find that Def is modified by phosphorylation at five serine residues: S50, S58, S62, S87, and S92. We further show that simultaneous phosphorylations at S87 and S92 facilitate the nucleolar localisation of Capn3 that is not only essential for the degradation of p53 but is also important for regulating cell cycle progression. Hence, we propose that the Def-CAPN3 pathway serves as a nucleolar checkpoint for cell proliferation by selective inactivation of cell cycle-related substrates during organogenesis.",

Chem. 272, 15980-15985), synaptojanin is identified as a protein that inhibits phospholipase D (PLD) activity stimulated by ADP-ribosylation factor and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Here, the purification from rat brain cytosol of another PLD-inhibitory protein that is immunologically distinct from synaptojanin is described, and this protein is identified as clathrin assembly protein 3 (AP3) by peptide sequencing and immunoblot analysis. AP3 binds both inositol hexakisphosphate and preassembled clathrin cages with high affinity. However, neither inositol hexakisphosphate binding nor clathrin cage binding affected the ability of AP3 to inhibit PLD. AP3 also binds to PI(4,5)P2 with low affinity. But the PI(4,5)P2 binding was not responsible for PLD inhibition, because the potency and efficacy of AP3 as an inhibitor of PLD were similar in the absence and presence of PI(4,5)P2. A bacterially expressed fusion protein, glutathione S-transferase-AP3 (GST-AP3), also inhibited PLD with a potency equal to that of brain AP3. The inhibitory effect of AP3 appeared to be the result of direct interaction between AP3 and PLD because PLD bound GST-AP3 in an in vitro binding assay. Using GST fusion proteins containing various AP3 sequences, we found that the sequence extending from residues Pro-290 to Lys-320 of AP3 is critical for both inhibition of and binding to PLD. The fact that AP3 is a synapse-specific protein indicates that the AP3-dependent inhibition of PLD might play a regulatory role that is restricted to the rapid cycling of synaptic vesicles.",

This interaction appears to be a crucial step in a mechanism by which receptor tyrosine kinases relay signals to downstream signaling pathways. Nck is a widely expressed protein consisting exclusively of SH2 and SH3 domains, the overexpression of which causes cell transformation. It has been shown that various growth factors stimulate the phosphorylation of Nck and its association with autophosphorylated growth factor receptors. A panel of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor mutations at tyrosine residues has been used to identify the Nck binding site. Here we show that mutation at Tyr-751 of the PDGF beta-receptor eliminates Nck binding both in vitro and in living cells. Moreover, the Y751F PDGF receptor mutant failed to mediate PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Nck in intact cells. A phosphorylated Tyr-751 is also required for binding of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase to the PDGF receptor. Hence, the SH2 domains of p85 and Nck share a binding site in the PDGF receptor. Competition experiments with different phosphopeptides derived from the PDGF receptor suggest that binding of Nck and p85 is influenced by different residues around Tyr-751. Thus, a single tyrosine autophosphorylation site is able to link the PDGF receptor to two distinct SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules.",

In addition to its physiologic role, GPIIb-IIIa also bears a number of clinically important alloantigenic determinants. Previous studies have shown that disruption of the long-range Cys(5)-Cys(435) disulfide bond of the beta(3) subunit results in the production of isoforms that bind some, but not all, anti-Pl(A1) alloantibodies, suggesting that mutations in this so-called long-range disulfide bond can alter the conformation of GPIIIa. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of either the Cys5Ala or Cys435Ala substitution of GPIIIa on the adhesive properties of the GPIIb-IIIa complex. We found that both Ala5GPIIIa and Ala435GPIIIa were capable of associating with GPIIb and were expressed normally on the cell surface when cotransfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells expressing GPIIb-Ala5GPIIIa or GPIIb-Ala435IIIa bound well-characterized, conformationally sensitive ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) antibodies, and were capable of constitutively binding the fibrinogen-mimetic monoclonal antibodies Pl-55 and PAC-1, as well as soluble fibrinogen. Both GPIIb-Ala5IIIa- and GPIIb-Ala435IIIa-transfected CHO cells also bound more avidly to immobilized fibrinogen and were capable of mediating the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK) on cell adhesion. These data are consistent with the notion that these regions of GPIIIa participate in the conformational change associated with receptor activation. Additionally, these studies may provide a molecular explanation for the previously reported ability of mild reducing agents to activate the GPIIb-IIIa complex and promote platelet aggregation.",

Aflatoxin B1 binds to GST A1-1 with a stoichiometry of 1.1 mol/mol of dimeric enzyme. The binding interaction, which can be described by a hyperbolic saturation isotherm (Kd = 8+/-2 microM), does not induce major structural changes in the enzyme, nor does it inhibit enzymatic activity. The average distance between the single tryptophan residue (Trp20) of GST A1-1 and protein-bound aflatoxin B1 was calculated to be 22.7 A by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The aflatoxin-binding region, according to this calculated distance, was determined to be located in the dimer interface cleft near the crystallographic two-fold axis. Hill-plot analyses suggest that a positive co-operative interaction exists between BSP and the dimeric GST A1-1 (h = 1.6+/-0.1; K' = 14+/-0.6 microM). The binding of BSP induces a conformational change in the enzyme which is accompanied by a decrease in the molecular flexibility and in the solvent-accessible properties of the enzyme's Trp20 residue. Site-directed mutagenesis of Trp20 (Trp20-->Phe) confirms that this residue is situated in the binding environment and although it is not essential for BSP binding, it is involved in the interaction. Furthermore, the structural change associated with BSP binding alters the hyperbolic character of the glutathione saturation curve. This indicates that there may also be a cooperative interaction between glutathione and BSP or that BSP binding induces asymmetric functioning of the two enzyme subunits so that they become unequal in catalytic activity.",

In vitro phosphorylation by protein kinase A increased the apparent size of NBD1-R from approximately 52 to approximately 56 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP bound to renatured NBD1-R with of 0.81 +/- 0.1 microM (wild-type), 0.93 +/- 0.1 microM (wild-type, phosphorylated), 0.75 +/- 0.1 microM (DeltaF508 NBD1-R), and 0.72 +/- 0.1 microM (DeltaF508 NBD1-R, phosphorylated) with a stoichiometry of approximately 1 TNP-ATP site per NBD1-R molecule; TNP-ATP binding was reversed by ATP, AMP-PCP, and AMP-PNP with KIs of approximately 3.2, 4.2, and 4.6 mM, respectively.

Analysis of phosphorylation sites indicated that inhibition involved multiple sites in NBD1-R, including serines 660, 712, 737, 795, and 813. These results establish the conditions for NBD1-R expression, purification, and renaturation.

However, Sprouty2 is up-regulated in some cancers, suggesting the existence of posttranscriptional mechanisms that permit evasion of Sprouty2-mediated antitumorigenic properties. We report that MAPK activation induces Sprouty2 phosphorylation on six serine residues, which reduced Sprouty2 association with wild-type B-Raf. Mutation of these six serines to nonphosphorylatable alanines increased the ability of Sprouty2 to inhibit growth factor-induced MAPK activation. Oncogenic B-Raf mutants such as B-Raf V600E did not associate with Sprouty2, but this resistance to Sprouty2 binding was not due to phosphorylation. Instead, the active kinase conformation induced by oncogenic mutation prevents Sprouty2 binding. These results reveal a dual mechanism that affects the Sprouty2/B-Raf interaction: Sprouty phosphorylation and B-Raf conformation.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate that a mutant H-2Dd molecule that does not interact with TAP due to a Glu to Lys mutation at residue 222 of the H chain (Dd(E222K)) also fails to bind to tapasin. This finding supports the view that tapasin bridges the association between class I and TAP and implicates residue 222 as a site of contact with tapasin. The inability of Dd(E222K) to interact with tapasin and TAP results in impaired peptide loading within the endoplasmic reticulum. However, significant acquisition of peptides can still be detected as assessed by the decay kinetics of cell surface Dd(E222K) molecules and by the finding that prolonged viral infection accumulates sufficient target structures to stimulate T cells at 50% the level observed with wild-type Dd. Thus, although interaction with tapasin and TAP enhances peptide loading, it is not essential. Finally, a cohort of Dd(E222K) molecules decays more rapidly on the cell surface compared with wild-type Dd molecules but much more slowly than peptide-deficient molecules. This suggests that some of the peptides obtained in the absence of an interaction with tapasin and TAP are suboptimal, suggesting a peptide-editing function for tapasin/TAP in addition to their role in enhancing peptide loading.",

The inhibitory activity of p85 is relieved by occupancy of the NH(2)-terminal SH2 domain of p85 by phosphorylated tyrosine. Src family kinases phosphorylate tyrosine 688 in p85, a process that we have shown to be reversed by the activity of the p85-associated SH2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP1. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of the downstream PI3K target Akt is increased in cells lacking SHP1, implicating phosphorylation of p85 in the regulation of PI3K activity. Furthermore, the in vitro specific activity of PI3K associated with tyrosine- phosphorylated p85 is higher than that associated with nonphosphorylated p85. Expression of wild-type p85 inhibits PI3K enzyme activity as indicated by PI3K- dependent Akt phosphorylation. The inhibitory activity of p85 is accentuated by mutation of tyrosine 688 to alanine and reversed by mutation of tyrosine 688 to aspartic acid, changes that block and mimic tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively Strikingly, mutation of tyrosine 688 to aspartic acid completely reverses the inhibitory activity of p85 on cell viability and activation of the downstream targets Akt and NFkappaB, indicative of the physiological relevance of p85 phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr(688) or mutation of tyrosine 688 to aspartic acid is sufficient to allow binding to the NH(2)-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Thus an intramolecular interaction between phosphorylated Tyr(688) and the NH(2)-terminal SH2 domain of p85 can relieve the inhibitory activity of p85 on p110.

Analytical centrifugation allowed to determine that p15 assembles as a rod-shaped tetramer. Oxidative cross-linking of N-terminal cysteines of the peptide generated specific covalent oligomers, indicating that the N terminus of p15 is a coiled-coil that assembles as a parallel tetramer.

We and others have demonstrated that during severe oxidative stress, however, the activated EGFR is disconnected from ERK activation in cultured renal proximal tubule cells and also in renal proximal tubules after ischemia/reperfusion injury, resulting in necrotic death. Studies have shown that the tyrosine-phosphorylated p46/52 isoforms of the ShcA family of adaptor proteins connect the activated EGFR to activation of Ras and ERK, whereas the p66(shc) isoform can inhibit this p46/52(shc) function. Here, we determined that severe oxidative stress (after a brief period of activation) terminates activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway, which coincides with ERK/JNK-dependent Ser(36) phosphorylation of p66(shc). Isoform-specific knockdown of p66(shc) or mutation of Ser(36) to Ala, but not to Asp, attenuated severe oxidative stress-mediated ERK inhibition and cell death in vitro. Also, severe oxidative stress (unlike ligand stimulation and moderate oxidative stress, both of which support survival) increased binding of p66(shc) to the activated EGFR and Grb2. This binding dissociated the SOS1 adaptor protein from the EGFR-recruited signaling complex, leading to termination of Ras/MEK/ERK activation. Notably, Ser(36) phosphorylation of p66(shc) and its increased binding to the EGFR also occurred in the kidney after ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. At the same time, SOS1 binding to the EGFR declined, similar to the in vitro findings. Thus, the mechanism we propose in vitro offers a means to ameliorate oxidative stress-induced cell injury by either inhibiting Ser(36) phosphorylation of p66(shc) or knocking down p66(shc) expression in vivo.",

IGF-binding protein inhibited binding of IGF-I and -II in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 5.43 and 108 micrograms/l respectively. A 125I-labelled IGF-I--IGF-binding protein complex, formed by incubating 125I-labelled IGF-I with IGF-binding protein overnight at 4 degrees C, did not effectively bind to endothelial IGF receptors. Addition of IGF-binding protein to PAEC previously incubated with IGF-I caused a marked dissociation of bound IGF-I (47% dissociation within 12h). These results indicate that the acid-stable IGF-binding protein which appears to be a part of the 150 kDa GH-dependent binding protein, blocks binding of IGF-I and -II by the IGF receptors and appears to exhibit a higher affinity for IGF-I than the endothelial type-I IGF receptor. The ramifications of this latter point with respect to transfer of circulating IGFs (bound to their IGF-binding proteins) across the vascular endothelium are not clear.",

A proliferative signal is associated with activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To determine whether other MAPK pathways are activated by G-CSF signalling, we have investigated activation of JNK/SAPK in cells proliferating in response to G-CSF. Here we show that G-CSF and interleukin-3 activate JNK/SAPK in two hemopoietic cell lines. The region of the G-CSF receptor required for G-CSF-induced JNK/SAPK activation is located within the C-terminal 68 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, which contains Tyr 763. Mutation of Tyr 763 to Phe completely blocks JNK/SAPK activation. However, the C-terminal 68 amino acids are not required for ERK2 activation. We show that activation of JNK/SAPK, like that of ERK2, is dependent on Ras but that higher levels of Ras-GTP are associated with activation of JNK/SAPK than with activation of ERK2. Two separate functional regions of the G-CSF receptor contribute to activation of Ras. The Y763F mutation reduces G-CSF-induced Ras activation from 30 to 35% Ras-GTP to 10 to 13% Ras-GTP. Low levels of Ras activation (10 to 13% Ras-GTP), which are sufficient for ERK2 activation, require only the 100 membrane-proximal amino acids. High levels of Ras-GTP provided by expression of oncogenic Ras are not sufficient to activate JNK/SAPK. An additional signal, also mediated by Tyr 763, is required for activation of JNK/SAPK.",

RNP recognition by the viral polymerase involves a specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein (P) (P(CTD)) and N. However, the P binding region on N remains to be identified. In this study, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays were used to identify the N-terminal core domain of HRSV N (N(NTD)) as a P binding domain. A biochemical characterization of the P(CTD) and molecular modeling of the N(NTD) allowed us to define four potential candidate pockets on N (pocket I [PI] to PIV) as hydrophobic sites surrounded by positively charged regions, which could constitute sites complementary to the P(CTD) interaction domain. The role of selected amino acids in the recognition of the N-RNA complex by P was first screened for by site-directed mutagenesis using a polymerase activity assay, based on an HRSV minigenome containing a luciferase reporter gene. When changed to Ala, most of the residues of PI were found to be critical for viral RNA synthesis, with the R132A mutant having the strongest effect. These mutations also reduced or abolished in vitro and in vivo P-N interactions, as determined by GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments. The pocket formed by these residues is critical for P binding to the N-RNA complex, is specific for pneumovirus N proteins, and is clearly distinct from the P binding sites identified so far for other nonsegmented negative-strand viruses.",

In this study we identified regions on integrin beta3 that control 7E3 binding. Murine/human amino acid substitutions were created in two regions of the betaA domain that previous studies found to influence 7E3 binding: the C177-C184 loop and K125-N133. The T182N substitution and a K125Q mutation reduced 7E3 binding to human beta3 in complex with alphaIIb. The introduction of both the human C177-C184 region and human W129 into murine beta3 was necessary and sufficient to permit 7E3 binding to the human alphaIIb/murine beta3 complex. Although we cannot exclude allosteric effects, we propose that 7E3 binds between C177-C184 and W129, which are within 15 A of each other in the crystal structure and close to the beta3 metal ion-dependent adhesion site. We previously demonstrated that 7E3 binds more rapidly to activated than unactivated platelets. Because it has been proposed that alphaIIbbeta3 changes from a bent to an extended conformation upon activation, we hypothesized that 7E3 binds less well to the bent than the extended conformation. In support of this hypothesis we found that 7E3 bound less well to an alphaIIbbeta3 construct locked in a bent conformation, and unlocking the conformation restored 7E3 binding. Thus, our data are consistent with alphaIIbbeta3 existing in variably bent conformations in equilibrium with each other on unactivated platelets, and activation resulting in alphaIIbbeta3 adopting a more extended conformation.",

Many ribosomal proteins undergo post-translational modification, but their exact roles remain elusive. Here, we report that ribosomal protein s10 (RPS10) is a novel substrate of an oncoprotein, protein-arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). We show that PRMT5 interacts with RPS10 and catalyzes its methylation at the Arg(158) and Arg(160) residues. The methylation of RPS10 at Arg(158) and Arg(160) plays a role in the proper assembly of ribosomes, protein synthesis, and optimal cell proliferation. The RPS10-R158K/R160K mutant is not efficiently assembled into ribosomes and is unstable and prone to degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In nucleoli, RPS10 interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 and is predominantly concentrated in the granular component region, which is required for ribosome assembly. The RPS10 methylation mutant interacts weakly with nucleophosmin/B23 and fails to concentrate in the granular component region. Our results suggest that PRMT5 is likely to regulate cell proliferation through the methylation of ribosome proteins, and thus reveal a novel mechanism for PRMT5 in tumorigenesis.",

Based on this observation, we used p18(INK4c) as a model to test the proposal that INK4 proteins with increased stability might have enhanced cell cycle inhibitory activity. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to prepare p18(INK4c) mutant proteins with a predicted increase in stability. Using this approach, we report the generation of three mutant p18(INK4C) proteins, F71N, F82Q, and F92N, with increased stability toward thermal denaturation of which the F71N mutant also showed an increased stability to chemical denaturation. The x-ray crystal structures of the F71N, F82Q, and F92N p18INK4C mutant proteins were determined to reveal the structural basis for their increased stability properties. Significantly, the F71N mutant also showed enhanced CDK6 interaction and cell cycle inhibitory activity in vivo, as measured using co-immunoprecipitation and transient transfection assays, respectively.

Here, we show that overexpression of the constitutively active rho4(Q131L) mutant in an rdi1\u0394 strain caused a severe growth defect and generated large, round, unbudded cells, suggesting that an excess of Rho4 activity could block bud emergence. We also generated four temperature-sensitive rho4-Ts alleles in a rho3\u0394 rho4\u0394 strain. These mutants showed growth and morphological defects at 37\u00b0C. Interestingly, two rho4-Ts alleles contain mutations that cause amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of Rho4. Rho4 possesses a long N-terminal extension that is unique among the six Rho GTPases in the budding yeast but is common in Rho4 homologs in other yeasts and filamentous fungi. We show that the N-terminal extension plays an important role in Rho4 function since rho3\u0394 rho4(\u0394)(61) cells expressing truncated Rho4 lacking amino acids (aa) 1 to 61 exhibited morphological defects at 24\u00b0C and a growth defect at 37\u00b0C.

Bem2 specifically interacts with the GTP-bound form of Rho4, and the interaction is mediated by its RhoGAP domain. Overexpression of BEM2 aggravates the defects of rho3\u0394 rho4 mutants.

When cells are grown in the presence of iron, transcription of all three genes is blocked. A conserved regulatory element, 5'-(A/T)GATAA-3', located upstream of the frp1(+), fip1(+), and fio1(+) genes, is necessary for iron repression. We have cloned a novel gene, termed fep1(+), which encodes an iron-sensing transcription factor. Binding studies reveal that the putative DNA binding domain of Fep1 expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli specifically interacts with the 5'-(A/T)GATAA-3' sequence in an iron-dependent manner. In a fep1 Delta mutant strain, the fio1(+) gene is highly expressed and is unregulated by iron. Furthermore, the fep1 Delta mutation increases activity of the cell surface iron reductase and renders cells hypersensitive to the iron-dependent free radical generator phleomycin. Mutations in the transcriptional co-repressors tup11(+) and tup12(+) are phenocopies to fep1(+). Indeed, strains with both tup11 Delta and tup12 Delta deletions fail to sense iron. This suggests that in the presence of iron and Fep1, the Tup11 and Tup12 proteins may act as co-repressors for down-regulation of genes encoding components of the reductive iron transport machinery.",

Its regulation of AKT activity can be enhanced by ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein-50 (EBP50)-mediated PTEN/EBP50/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) complex. EBP50 was reported to bind to EGFR, and that it may also mediate the formation of PTEN/EGFR complex to regulate EGFR/AKT signaling. In this study, experiments were performed to verify the hypothesis. Results showed that PTEN co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR, demonstrating PTEN/EGFR complex can form in tissue. Further studies showed that EBP50 knockdown decreased the amount of PTEN/EGFR complex by GST pull-down assay, and EBP50 overexpression increased the amount of PTEN/EGFR complex in a dose-dependent manner. While PTEN mutant (V403A), which can not bind with EBP50, only slightly mediated the formation of PTEN/EGFR complex, confirming that EBP50 specifically mediated the formation of the PTEN/EGFR complex. Both PTEN (V403A) and EGFR (L1043/1063F) mutants can not bind with EBP50. The expression of PTEN (V403A) or EGFR (L1043/1063F) mutant in cells resulted in higher AKT activation level than their respective wild-types by EGF stimulation, indicating that EBP50-mediated PTEN/EGFR complex can effectively inhibit EGF-induced AKT activation. EGF stimulation of siEBP50 cells induced higher AKT activation level compared with control cells, further confirming EBP50-mediated PTEN/EGFR complex can more effectively inhibit EGF-induced AKT activation. These results demonstrated the PTEN/EGFR complex formed under the mediation of EBP50, revealing a novel mechanism for negative regulation of EGF-induced AKT pathway, which may be an important molecular target for antineoplastic therapy.",

Interactions with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, pRb, and related proteins p107 and p130 rely somewhat on CR1 but largely on CR2, which contains a core binding sequence Leu-122-X-Cys-X-Glu. We introduced point mutations in CR2 to define such interactions more precisely. In human cells, alteration of any of the conserved residues within the binding core eliminated complex formation with pRb. Conversion of nonconserved Thr-123 to Pro (but not to either Ala or Ser) disrupted binding of pRb, presumably because of conformational changes in the binding core. No single E1A point mutant was completely defective in binding p107, suggesting that molecular interactions between E1A proteins and p107 clearly differ from those with pRb and p130. In general, the patterns of complex formation by E1A mutants in rat, monkey, and human cells were quite similar. All mutants which failed to bind significant amounts of pRb also failed to transform primary rat cells. Several mutants demonstrated selective binding to pRb, p107, and p130, but transforming activity corresponded largely with complex formation with pRb, regardless of the levels of interactions with p107 and p130. Mutants defective for binding of both pRb and p107 failed to induce the activity of transcription factor E2F; however, quite high levels were activated by E1A mutants that interacted with p107 alone. These results suggested that both pRb and p107 are important regulators of E2F activity but that complex formation with and activation of E2F by p107 are insufficient for cell transformation.",

Biol. Chem. 276 (2001) 2069]. We report here that CaMBP increases [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 in a dose- and Ca2+-dependent manner; it also induces Ca2+ release from SR vesicles, and increases open probability (P(o)) of single RyR channels reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers. Further, CaMBP removes CaM associated with SR vesicles and increases [3H]ryanodine binding to purified RyR1, suggesting that its mechanism of action is two-fold: it removes endogenous inhibitors and also interacts directly with complementary regions in RyR1. Remarkably, the N-terminus of CaMBP activates RyRs while the C-terminus of CaMBP inhibits RyR activity, suggesting the presence of two discrete functional subdomains within this region. A ryr1 mutant lacking this region, RyR1-Delta3614-3643, was constructed and expressed in dyspedic myoblasts (RyR1-knockout). The depolarization-, caffeine- and 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC)-induced Ca2+ transients in these cells were dramatically reduced compared with cells expressing wild type RyR1. Deletion of the 3614-3643 region also resulted in profound changes in unitary conductance and channel gating.

A p53 protein lacking the proline-rich region (p53delta62-91) induces many p53-responsive genes but not PIG3. In parallel, this mutant induces growth arrest but not apoptosis. We show here that the replacement of the N-terminal (amino acids 1-80) or C-terminal (amino acids 344-393) domains of p53 with heterologous domains does not interfere with transcription from the PIG3 promoter, but these chimeras still require the proline-rich region for PIG3 activation. The p53-homolog p73beta also activated the PIG3 promoter, but in contrast to p53, the proline-rich domain of p73beta (residues 81-113) was dispensable to induce the PIG3 promoter. Some tumor-derived p53-mutants, especially M246I, retained the ability to activate transcription of mdm2 but specifically failed to induce the PIG3 promoter, thus resembling p53delta62-91. Further, p53delta62-91 and p53M246I were defective for induction of apoptosis. Finally, p53delta62-91 and p53M246I both showed reduced binding to the DNA of the PIG3 promoter and also to the DNA of the mdm2 and p21 promoters in vitro. Correspondingly, at low expression levels, p53delta62-91 and p53M246I poorly activated the mdm2 promoter when compared to wild type p53. Our results suggest that the proline-rich domain of p53 affects the ability of the central domain to bind DNA.

However, the data regarding the role of 14-3-3\u03b6 in GPIb-IX-VWF interaction-induced signaling still remain controversial. In the present study, the data indicate that the S609A mutation replacing Ser(609) of GPIb\u03b1 with alanine (S609A) significantly prevented the association of 14-3-3\u03b6 with GPIb\u03b1 before and after the VWF binding to GPIb\u03b1. GPIb-IX-VWF interaction-induced activations of Src family kinases and protein kinase C were clearly reduced in S609A mutation.

The proposed mechanisms include tethering the E1B repression domain to p53-responsive promoters via direct E1B-p53 interaction. Cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the 55-kDa protein would impose additional inhibition on p53-mediated effects. To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body. Deletion of amino acids 11 to 27 or even point mutation L22Q/W23S abolished the localization of p53 to the cytoplasmic body, whereas other parts of TAD and the C-terminal domain of p53 are dispensable. This cytoplasmic body is distinct from aggresome associated with overexpression of some proteins, since it neither altered vimentin intermediate filaments nor associated with centrosome or ubiquitin. Formation of this structure is sensitive to mutation of the Ad12 55-kDa protein. Strikingly, mutation S476/477A near the C terminus of the Ad12 55-kDa protein eliminated the formation of the cytoplasmic body. The equivalent residues in the Ad5 55-kDa protein were shown to be critical for its ability to inhibit p53. Indeed, Ad12 55-kDa mutants that cannot form a cytoplasmic body can no longer inhibit p53-mediated effects. Conversely, the Ad12 55-kDa protein does not suppress p53 mutant L22Q/W23S-mediated apoptosis. Finally, we show that E1B can still sequester p53 that contains the mitochondrial import sequence, thereby potentially preventing the localization of p53 to mitochondria. Thus, cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the E1B 55-kDa protein plays an important role in restricting p53 activities.",

Here, we describe a construct for the optimized bacterial expression and purification of the MDM2 p53 binding domain. We found that the expression level of the soluble MDM2 p53 binding domain in bacteria was increased dramatically by fusing it to its interaction partner, the p53 transactivation peptide. Attachment of the p53 transactivation peptide (residues 17-29) to the N-terminus of MDM2 resulted in a more than 200-fold increase of soluble protein expression of the p53 binding domain in bacteria.

The negative signaling pathways downstream of RANKL are not well characterized. By retroviral transduction of RAW264.7 cells with a dominant negative Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1)(C453S), we studied the role of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Over-expression of SHP-1(C453S) significantly enhanced the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinuclear osteoclast-like cells in response to RANKL in a dose-dependent manner. RANKL induced the recruitment of SHP-1 to a complex containing TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)6. GST pull down experiments indicated that the association of SHP-1 with TRAF6 is mediated by SHP-1 lacking the two Src homology 2 domains. RANKL-stimulated IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation, IkappaB-alpha degradation and DNA binding ability of NF-kappaB were increased after over-expression of SHP-1(C453S). However, RANKL-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, was unchanged. In addition, SHP-1 regulated RANKL-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the phosphorylation of Akt. Increased numbers of osteoclasts contribute to severe osteopenia in Me(v)/Me(v) mice due to mutation of SHP-1. Like RAW264.7 cells expressing SHP-1(C453S), the bone marrow macrophages of Me(v)/Me(v) mice generated much more osteoclast-like cells than that of littermate controls in response to RANKL. Furthermore compared with controls, RANKL induces enhanced association of TRAF6 and RANK in both RAW264.7 cells expressing SHP-1(C453S) and bone marrow macrophages from Me(v)/Me(v) mice. Therefore, SHP-1 plays a role in signals downstream of RANKL by recruitment to the complex containing TRAF6 and these observations may help to understand the mechanism of osteoporosis in Me(v)/Me(v) mice.",

This interaction is important for phosphorylation of Rb by cdk4/D1, although in vitro the Rb C domain alone is efficiently phosphorylated by cdk4/D1. A mutation in the C domain of Rb, L901Q, has been identified that completely abolishes cdk4/D1 phosphorylation of the isolated C domain. By contrast, the L901Q mutation has no effect on phosphorylation by either cyclin E/cdk2 or cyclin B/cdk1, suggesting that the interaction between L901Q and cdk4/D1 is specific. Introduction of the L901Q mutation into Rb containing the A, B, and C domains results in phosphorylation becoming predominantly dependent on the LXCXE binding region. However, when the LXCXE binding region of Rb is mutated, phosphorylation becomes dependent on the L901 site within the C domain. The L901 binding site can supplant the LXCXE binding site for the cdk4/D1-dependent phosphorylation of S780 and S795 but not S807/S811.

Here, we demonstrate that Akt phosphorylates the cell cycle inhibitory protein p21(Cip1) at Thr 145 in vitro and in intact cells as shown by in vitro kinase assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and phospho-peptide analysis. Akt-dependent phosphorylation of p21(Cip1) at Thr 145 prevents the complex formation of p21(Cip1) with PCNA, which inhibits DNA replication. In addition, phosphorylation of p21(Cip1) at Thr 145 decreases the binding of the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk4 to p21(Cip1) and attenuates the Cdk2 inhibitory activity of p21(Cip1). Immunohistochemistry and biochemical fractionation reveal that the decrease of PCNA binding and regulation of Cdk activity by p21(Cip1) phosphorylation is not caused by altered intracellular localization of p21(Cip1). As a functional consequence, phospho-mimetic mutagenesis of Thr 145 reverses the cell cycle-inhibitory properties of p21(Cip1), whereas the nonphosphorylatable p21(Cip1) T145A construct arrests cells in G(0) phase.

Here we show that, although the MKP DUSP5 both inactivates and anchors ERK in the nucleus, it paradoxically increases and prolongs cytoplasmic ERK activity. The latter effect is caused, at least in part, by the relief of ERK-mediated RAF inhibition. The importance of this spatiotemporal interaction between these distinct feedback mechanisms is illustrated by the fact that expression of oncogenic BRAFV600E, a feedback-insensitive mutant RAF kinase, reprograms DUSP5 into a cell-wide ERK inhibitor that facilitates cell proliferation and transformation. In contrast, DUSP5 deletion causes BRAFV600E-induced ERK hyperactivation and cellular senescence. Thus, feedback interactions within the ERK pathway can regulate cell proliferation and transformation, and suggest oncogene-specific roles for DUSP5 in controlling ERK signaling and cell fate.",

Given that MDM2 protein binds ATP, can interact with the Hsp90 chaperone, plays a role in the modulation of transcription factors and protection and activation of DNA polymerases, and is involved in ribosome assembly and nascent p53 protein biosynthesis, we have evaluated and found MDM2 protein to possess an intrinsic molecular chaperone activity. MDM2 can substitute for the Hsp90 molecular chaperone in promoting binding of p53 to the p21-derived promoter sequence. This reaction is driven by recycling of MDM2 from the p53 complex, triggered by binding of ATP to MDM2. The ATP binding mutant MDM2 protein (K454A) lacks the chaperone activity both in vivo and in vitro. Mdm2 cotransfected in the H1299 cell line with wild-type p53 stimulates efficient p53 folding in vivo but at the same time accelerates the degradation of p53. MDM2 in which one of the Zn(2+) coordinating residues is mutated (C478S or C464A) blocks degradation but enhances folding of p53. This is the first demonstration that MDM2 possesses an intrinsic molecular chaperone activity, indicating that the ATP binding function of MDM2 can mediate its chaperone function toward the p53 tumor suppressor.",

Recent studies have reported that the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis, although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be determined. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. In this study, we find that expression of Akt reduces the protein levels of p53, at least in part by enhancing the degradation of p53. Both Akt expression and serum treatment induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser186. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser186 had little effect on the subcellular localization of Mdm2. However, both Akt expression and serum treatment increased Mdm2 ubiquitination of p53. The serum-induced increase in p53 ubiquitination was blocked by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase inhibitor. Moreover, when Ser186 was replaced by Ala, Mdm2 became resistant to Akt enhancement of p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Collectively, these results suggest that Akt enhances the ubiquitination-promoting function of Mdm2 by phosphorylation of Ser186, which results in reduction of p53 protein. This study may shed light on the mechanisms by which Akt promotes survival, proliferation, and tumorigenesis.",

MDM2 is an E3-RING containing ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes p53 ubiquitination by a dual-site mechanism requiring ligand occupation of its N-terminal hydrophobic pocket, which then stabilizes MDM2 binding to the ubiquitination signal in the DNA-binding domain of p53. A unique pseudo-substrate motif or \"lid\" in MDM2 is adjacent to its N-terminal hydrophobic pocket, and we have evaluated the effects of the flexible lid on the dual-site ubiquitination reaction mechanism catalyzed by MDM2. Deletion of this pseudo-substrate motif promotes MDM2 protein thermoinstability, indicating that the site can function as a positive regulatory element. Phospho-mimetic mutation in the pseudo-substrate motif at codon 17 (MDM2(S17D)) stabilizes the binding of MDM2 towards two distinct peptide docking sites within the p53 tetramer and enhances p53 ubiquitination. Molecular modeling orientates the phospho-mimetic pseudo-substrate motif in equilibrium over a charged surface patch on the MDM2 at Arg(97)/Lys(98), and mutation of these residues to the MDM4 equivalent reverses the activating effect of the phospho-mimetic mutation on MDM2 function. These data highlight the ability of the pseudo-substrate motif to regulate the allosteric interaction between the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 and its central acidic domain, which stimulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2.

This regulation is accompanied by a conformational change that can be probed by digestion with trypsin and involves the hydrophilic loop connecting the transmembrane helices VIII-IX. In the present work we show that a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 1F6, recognizes yet another domain of NhaA in a pH-dependent manner. This antibody binds NhaA at pH 8.5 but not at pH 4.5, whereas two other mAbs bind to NhaA independently of pH. The epitope of mAb 1F6 was located at the NH(2) terminus of NhaA by probing proteolytic fragments in Western blot analysis and amino acid sequencing. The antibody bound to the peptide HLHRFFSS, starting at the third amino acid of NhaA. A synthetic peptide with this sequence was shown to bind mAb 1F6 both at acidic and alkaline pH suggesting that this peptide is accessible to mAb 1F6 in the native protein only at alkaline pH. Although slightly shifted to acidic pH, the pH profile of the binding of mAb 1F6 to the antiporter is similar to that of both the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter activity as well as to its sensitivity to trypsin. We thus suggest that these pH profiles reflect a pH-dependent conformational change, which leads to activation of the antiporter. Indeed, a replacement of Gly-338 by Ser (G338S), which alleviates the pH dependence of both the NhaA activity as well as its sensitivity to trypsin, affects in a similar pattern the binding of mAb 1F6 to NhaA. Furthermore, the binding site of mAb 1F6 is involved in the functioning of the antiporter as follows: a double Cys replacement H3C/H5C causes an acidic shift by half a pH unit in the pH dependence of the antiporter; N-ethylmaleimide, which does not inhibit the wild-type protein, inhibits H3C/H5C antiporter to an extent similar to that exerted by mAb 1F6.",

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a phenotype caused by mutations in desmosomal components in \u223c 50% of patients, however, the causes in the remaining 50% of patients still remain unknown. A deficiency of inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP), an evolutionarily conserved inhibitor of p53, caused by spontaneous mutation recently has been associated with a lethal autosomal recessive cardiomyopathy in Poll Hereford calves and Wa3 mice. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this putative function of iASPP are completely unknown. Here, we show that iASPP is expressed at intercalated discs in human and mouse postmitotic cardiomyocytes. iASPP interacts with desmoplakin and desmin in cardiomyocytes to maintain the integrity of desmosomes and intermediate filament networks in vitro and in vivo. iASPP deficiency specifically induces right ventricular dilatation in mouse embryos at embryonic day 16.5. iASPP-deficient mice with exon 8 deletion (Ppp1r13l(\u03948/\u03948)) die of sudden cardiac death, displaying features of ARVC. Intercalated discs in cardiomyocytes from four of six human ARVC cases show reduced or loss of iASPP. ARVC-derived desmoplakin mutants DSP-1-V30M and DSP-1-S299R exhibit weaker binding to iASPP. These data demonstrate that by interacting with desmoplakin and desmin, iASPP is an important regulator of desmosomal function both in vitro and in vivo.

We show that a mutant calstabin2 in which a key negatively charged residue (Asp-37) has been neutralized binds to a mutant RyR2 channel that mimics constitutively PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 (RyR2-S2808D).

Heterodimer interactions between HER-2 and HER-3 (erbB-3) are activated by neu differentiation factor/heregulin (HRG), and HER-2/HER-3 heterodimers are constitutively activated in breast cancer cells with HER-2 gene amplification. This indicates that inhibition of HER-2/HER-3 heterodimer function may be an especially effective and unique strategy for blocking the HER-2-mediated transformation of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we constructed a bicistronic retroviral expression vector (pCMV-dn3) containing a dominant negative form of HER-3 in which most of the cytoplasmic domain was removed for introduction into cells. By using a bicistronic retroviral vector in which the antibiotic resistance gene and the gene of interest are driven by a single promoter, we attained 100% coordinate coexpression of antibiotic resistance with the gene of interest in target cell populations. Breast carcinoma cells with HER-2 gene amplification (21 MT-1 cells) and normal mammary epithelial cells without HER-2 gene amplification from the same patient (H16N-2 cells) were infected with pCMV-dn3 and assessed for HER-2/ HER-3 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, p85PI 3-kinase and SHC protein activation, growth factor-dependent and -independent proliferation, and transformed growth in culture.

Furthermore, the HRG-induced or growth factor-independent proliferation of 21 MT-1 cells was inhibited by dominant negative HER-3, whereas the epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation of these cells was not: this indicates that dominant negative HER-3 preferentially inhibits proliferation induced by HER-2/HER-3.",

It consists of an N-terminal beta helix and a C-terminal ferredoxin-like alpha/beta domain. RP2 is functionally and structurally related to the tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C. Seven of nine known RP2 missense mutations identified in patients are located in the beta helix domain, and most of them cluster to the hydrophobic core and are likely to destabilize the protein. Two residues, Glu138 and the catalytically important Arg118, are solvent-exposed and form a salt bridge, indicating that Glu138 might be critical for positioning Arg118 for catalysis. RP2 is a specific effector protein of Arl3. The N-terminal 34 residues and beta helix domain of RP2 are required for this interaction. The abilitities of RP2 to bind Arl3 and cause retinitis pigmentosa seem to be correlated, since both the R118H and E138G mutants show a drastically reduced affinity to Arl3.",

It has been shown that the adapter Crk-II is constitutively associated with C3G, a GDP to GTP exchange factor for several small GTP-binding proteins. We found that inhibition of the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or phospholipase C did not prevent the stimulation of glucose transport by osmotic shock, whereas inactivation of Rho proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B severely inhibited glucose uptake. Among the Rho family members, overexpression of dominant-interfering TC10/T31N mutant inhibited osmotic shock-mediated Glut 4 translocation suggesting that TC10 is required for this process. Further, disruption of cortical actin integrity by latrunculin B or jasplakinolide severely impaired osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. In contrast, osmotic shock increased the amount of cortical actin associated with caveolin-enriched plasma membrane domains. These data provide the first evidence that activation of TC10 and remodeling of cortical actin, which could occur through the TC10 signaling, are required for osmotic shock-mediated Glut 4 translocation and glucose uptake.",

          "text": "PURPOSE: The human cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel comprises alpha- and beta-subunits, which are respectively encoded by hCNGA3 and hCNGB3. The purpose was to examine the functional role of hCNGB3 in modulation of human cone CNG channels and to characterize functional consequences of rod monochromacy-associated mutations in hCNGB3 (S435F and D633G). METHODS: Macroscopic patch currents were recorded from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing homomeric (hCNGA3 and hCNGB3) and heteromeric (hCNGA3/hCNGB3, hCNGA3/hCNGB3-S435F, and hCNGA3/hCNGB3-D633G) channels using inside-out patch-clamp technique. RESULTS: Both hCNGA3 homomeric and hCNGA3/hCNGB3 heteromeric channels were activated by cGMP, with half-maximally activating concentration (K(1/2)) of 11.1 +/- 1.0 and 26.2 +/- 1.9 micro M, respectively. The hCNGA3 channels appeared to be more sensitive to inhibition by extracellular Ca(2+) compared with hCNGA3/hCNGB3 channels, when assessed by the degree of outward rectification. Coexpression of either of rod monochromacy-associated mutants of hCNGB3 with hCNGA3 significantly reduced K(1/2) value for cGMP but little affected the sensitivity to extracellular Ca(2+), compared with wild-type heteromeric channels. The selectivity of hCNGA3, hCNGA3/hCNGB3, hCNGA3/hCNGB3-S435F, and hCNGA3/hCNGB3-D633G channels for monovalent cations were largely similar. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed association of hCNGA3 subunit with both of wild-type and mutant hCNGB3 subunits. CONCLUSIONS: The hCNGB3 plays an important modulatory role in the function of human cone CNG channels with respect to cGMP and extracellular Ca(2+) sensitivities. The rod monochromacy-associated S435F and D633G mutations in hCNGB3 evokes a significant increase in the apparent affinity for cGMP, which should alter cone function and thereby contribute at least partly to pathogenesis of the disease.",

Cytosolic enzyme carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) catalyzes the reaction CO(2) + H(2)O left arrow over right arrow HCO(3)(-) + H(+) in many tissues. We investigated whether NBC3, like some Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange proteins, could bind CAII and whether PKA could regulate NBC3 activity through modulation of CAII binding. CAII bound the COOH-terminal domain of NBC3 (NBC3Ct) with K(d) = 101 nM; the interaction was stronger at acid pH. Cotransfection of HEK-293 cells with NBC3 and CAII recruited CAII to the plasma membrane. Mutagenesis of consensus CAII binding sites revealed that the D1135-D1136 region of NBC3 is essential for CAII/NBC3 interaction and for optimal function, because the NBC3 D1135N/D1136N retained only 29 +/- 22% of wild-type activity. Coexpression of the functionally dominant-negative CAII mutant V143Y with NBC3 or addition of 100 microM 8-bromoadenosine to NBC3 transfected cells reduced intracellular pH (pH(i)) recovery rate by 31 +/- 3, or 38 +/- 7%, respectively, relative to untreated NBC3 transfected cells. The effects were additive, together decreasing the pH(i) recovery rate by 69 +/- 12%, suggesting that PKA reduces transport activity by a mechanism independently of CAII. Measurements of PKA-dependent phosphorylation by mass spectroscopy and labeling with [gamma-(32)P]ATP showed that NBC3Ct was not a PKA substrate. These results demonstrate that NBC3 and CAII interact to maximize the HCO(3)(-) transport rate. Although PKA decreased NBC3 transport activity, it did so independently of the NBC3/CAII interaction and did not involve phosphorylation of NBC3Ct.",

Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), plays a critical role in the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including mast cells. Kit, via Tyr(567) and Tyr(719), activates Src family kinases (SFK) and PI3K respectively, which converge on the activation of a Rac/JNK pathway required for mast cell proliferation. However, how Kit Tyr(567) signals to Rac/JNK is not well understood. By analyzing Gab2(-/-) mast cells, we find that Gab2 is required for SCF-evoked proliferation, activation of Rac/JNK, and Ras. Upon Kit activation in wild-type mast cells, Gab2 becomes tyrosyl-phosphorylated and associates with Kit and Shp-2. Tyr(567), an SFK binding site in Kit, and SFK activity were required for Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and association with Shp-2. By re-expressing Gab2 or a Gab2 mutant that cannot bind Shp-2 in Gab2(-/-) mast cells or acutely by deleting Shp-2 in mast cells, we found that Gab2 requires Shp-2 for SCF-evoked Rac/JNK, Ras activation, and mast cell proliferation. Lastly, by analyzing mast cells from mice with compound Gab2 and Kit Y719F mutations (i.e., Gab2(-/-): KitY719F/Y719F mice), we find that Gab2, acting in a parallel pathway to PI3K from Kit Tyr(719), regulates mast cell proliferation and development in specific tissues. Our data show that Gab2 via Shp-2 is critical for transmitting signals from Kit Tyr(567) to activate the Rac/JNK pathway controlling mast cell proliferation, which likely contributes to mast cell development in specific tissues.",

As Puma can to bind and inactivate all anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, its activity must be tightly controlled. We report here, for the first time, evidence that Puma is subject to post-translational control through phosphorylation. We show that Puma is phosphorylated at multiple sites, with the major site of phosphorylation being serine 10. Replacing serine 10 with alanine causes reduced Puma turnover and enhanced cell death. Interestingly, Puma turnover occurs through the proteasome, and substitution of serine 10 causes elevated Puma levels independently of macroautophagy, Bcl-2 family member binding, caspase activity and apoptotic death. We conclude, therefore, that phosphorylation of Puma at serine 10 promotes Puma turnover, represses Puma's cell death potential and promotes cell survival. Owing to the highly pro-apoptotic nature of Puma, these studies highlight an important additional regulatory step in the determination of cellular life or death.",

The single Cys residue (Cys-8) in the M ectodomain was crucial for heterodimerization and virus infectivity. Mutagenesis of any of the five Cys residues in the GP(5) ectodomain or removal of the single GP(5) N-glycosylation site also rendered the full-length clone noninfectious. However, an analysis of revertants yielded an exceptional pseudorevertant in which residues 52 to 79 of the GP(5) ectodomain had been deleted and the original Cys-80-->Ser mutation had been maintained. Consequently, this revertant lacked the GP(5) N-glycosyation site (Asn-56) and retained only a single cysteine residue (Cys-34). By using this GP(5) deletion, we confirmed that Cys-34 of GP(5) and Cys-8 of M are essential for GP(5)-M heterodimerization, a key event in the assembly of the EAV envelope.",

Sequence comparisons of the gammaherpesvirus vGPCRs revealed a highly conserved region in the C tail, just distal to the seventh transmembrane domain. Mutagenesis of the corresponding codons of HHV-8 ORF74 was carried out to provide C-tail-altered proteins for functional analyses. By measuring receptor-activated vascular endothelial growth factor promoter induction and NF-kappaB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Ca(2+) signaling, we found that while some altered receptors showed general signaling deficiencies, others had distinguishable activation profiles, suggestive of selective Galpha protein coupling. This was supported by the finding that vGPCR and representative functionally altered variants, vGPCR.8 (R322W) and vGPCR.15 (M325S), were affected differently by inhibitors of Galpha(i) (pertussis toxin), protein kinase C (GF109203X), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin). Consistent with the signaling data, [(35)S]GTPgammaS incorporation assays revealed preferential coupling of vGPCR.15 to Galpha(q) and an inability of vGPCR.8 to couple functionally to Galpha(q). However, both variants, wild-type vGPCR, and a C-tail deletion version of the receptor were equally able to associate physically with Galpha(q).

Of particular importance is the cAMP-dependent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- channel (CFTR) with mutations of the CFTR encoding gene causing cystic fibrosis. The bulk transepithelial transport of Cl- ions and electrolytes needs however to be coupled to an increase in K+ conductance in order to recycle K+ and maintain an electrical driving force for anion exit across the apical membrane. In several epithelia, this K+ efflux is ensured by K+ channels, including KCa3.1, which is expressed at both the apical and basolateral membranes. We show here for the first time that CFTR and KCa3.1 can physically interact. We first performed a two-hybrid screen to identify which KCa3.1 cytosolic domains might mediate an interaction with CFTR. Our results showed that both the N-terminal fragment M1-M40 of KCa3.1 and part of the KCa3.1 calmodulin binding domain (residues L345-A400) interact with the NBD2 segment (G1237-Y1420) and C- region of CFTR (residues T1387-L1480), respectively. An association of CFTR and F508del-CFTR with KCa3.1 was further confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating the formation of immunoprecipitable CFTR/KCa3.1 complexes in CFBE cells. Co-expression of KCa3.1 and CFTR in HEK cells did not impact CFTR expression at the cell surface, and KCa3.1 trafficking appeared independent of CFTR stimulation. Finally, evidence is presented through cross-correlation spectroscopy measurements that KCa3.1 and CFTR colocalize at the plasma membrane and that KCa3.1 channels tend to aggregate consequent to an enhanced interaction with CFTR channels at the plasma membrane following an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Altogether, these results suggest 1) that the physical interaction KCa3.1/CFTR can occur early during the biogenesis of both proteins and 2) that KCa3.1 and CFTR form a dynamic complex, the formation of which depends on internal Ca2+.",

The crystal structure shows the expected dimer core structure and significant conformational variations of the KaiB C-terminal region, which is functionally important in maintaining rhythmicity. The KaiBC sample was formed with a C-terminally truncated form of KaiC, KaiC-\u0394489, which is persistently phosphorylated. The KaiB-KaiC-\u0394489 structure reveals that the KaiC hexamer can bind six monomers of KaiB, which form a continuous ring of density in the KaiBC complex. We performed cryoEM-guided molecular dynamics flexible fitting simulations with crystal structures of KaiB and KaiC to probe the KaiBC protein-protein interface. This analysis indicated a favorable binding mode for the KaiB monomer on the CII end of KaiC, involving two adjacent KaiC subunits and spanning an ATP binding cleft. A KaiC mutation, R468C, which has been shown to affect the affinity of KaiB for KaiC and lengthen the period in a bioluminescence rhythm assay, is found within the middle of the predicted KaiBC interface.

Rather, it preferentially selects the activated receptor conformation, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward R*. The hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) contains two residues, Tyr4 and Phe8, that are essential for agonism. We show that the conserved Asn111 in transmembrane helix III of the AT1 angiotensin receptor directly interacts with the Tyr4 side chain. A decrease in the size of the Asn111 side chain induces an intermediate activated receptor conformation (R'). The Ang II analogue [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]Ang II fully activates the N111G mutant, indicating that either the transition from R' to R* or the stabilization of the R* state requires binding by Ang II but not its Tyr4 and Phe8 side chains. In contrast, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]Ang II binds to but does not activate the wild-type AT1 receptor (R), suggesting that in the wild-type receptor spontaneous occurrence of R' and R* states is rare. Thus, Ang II through interactions involving Tyr4 and Phe8 induces a transition from R to R' and through unspecified interactions induces transition from R' to R* states rather than stabilizing the spontaneously generated R* state by \"conformational, selection\".",

The signal peptide of the MMTV envelope precursor is uniquely targeted to nucleoli of cells that harbor the virus, where it can function as a nuclear export factor for intron-containing transcripts. Antibodies to this signal peptide, which we refer to as p14, were previously shown to label nucleoli in a subset of human breast cancers. To look for additional cellular functions of p14, different mutants were ectopically expressed in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. This approach identified motifs responsible for its nucleolar targeting, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, target protein (B23, nucleophosmin) binding, and phosphorylation at serine 18 and 65 both in situ and in vitro. To test the role of these phosphorylation sites, we carried out in vivo tumorigenesis studies in severe combined immunodeficient mice. The findings show that the p14-Ser65Ala mutation is associated with impaired tumorigenicity, whereas the p14-Ser18Ala mutation is associated with enhanced tumorigenicity. Microarray analysis suggests that phosphorylation at serine 18 or at serine 65 is associated with transcriptional regulation of the L5 nucleolar ribosomal protein (a p14 target) and the Erb-B signal transduction pathway. Taken together, these results show that the phosphorylation status of p14 determines whether it functions as a pro-oncogenic or antioncogenic modulator.",

For efficient degradation of p53, Mdm2 needs to be phosphorylated at several contiguous residues within the central conserved domain.

Inhibition of GSK-3 rescued p53 from degradation in an Mdm2-dependent manner while its association with Mdm2 was not affected. Likewise, inhibition of GSK-3 did not alter localization of p53 and Mdm2 or the interaction of Mdm2 and MdmX. Ionizing radiation, which leads to p53 accumulation, directed phosphorylation of GSK-3 at serine 9, which preceded and overlapped with the increase in p53 levels. Moreover, expression of a GSK-3 mutant where serine 9 was replaced with an alanine reduced the accumulation of p53 and induction of its target p21(WAF-1). We therefore conclude that inhibition of GSK-3 contributes to hypophosphorylation of Mdm2 in response to ionizing rays, and in consequence to p53 stabilization.",

Our present studies examine the catabolism of urinary plasminogen activator (uPA)-PN1 inhibitory complexes, which, unlike Th.PN1 complexes, bind almost exclusively through the uPA receptor. In addition, the binding site in PN1 required for the LRP-mediated internalization of Th.PN1 complexes is not required for the LRP-mediated internalization of uPA.PN1 complexes. Thus, the protease moiety of the complex partially determines the mechanistic route of entry. Because cell surface heparins are only minimally involved in the binding and internalization of uPA.PN1 complexes, we then predicted that complexes between uPA and the heparin binding-deficient PN1 variant, PN1(K7E), should be catabolized at the same rate as complexes formed with native PN1. Surprisingly, the uPA.PN1(K7E) complexes were degraded at only a fraction of the rate of native complexes. Internalization studies revealed that both uPA. PN1(K7E) and native uPA.PN1 complexes were initially internalized at the same rate, but uPA.PN1(K7E) complexes were rapidly retro-endocytosed in an intact form. By examining the pH dependence of complex binding in the range of 4.0-7.0, it was determined that the uPA.PN1 inhibitory complexes must specifically bind to endosomal heparins at pH 5.5 to be retained and sorted to lysosomes. These studies are the first to document a role for heparins in the catabolism of SERPIN-protease complexes at a point further in the pathway than cell surface binding, and this role may extend to other heparin-binding LRP-internalized ligands.",

The effects of other PD-associated point mutations are less clear. Here we demonstrate that the M26I mutation reduces DJ-1 expression, particularly in a null background (knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Thus, homozygous M26I mutation causes loss of DJ-1 protein. To determine the cellular consequences, we measured suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and cytotoxicity for [M26I]DJ-1, and systematically all other DJ-1 methionine and cysteine mutants. C106A mutation of the central redox site specifically abolished binding to ASK1 and the cytoprotective activity of DJ-1. DJ-1 was apparently recruited into the ASK1 signalosome via Cys-106-linked mixed disulfides. The designed higher order oxidation mimicking [C106DD]DJ-1 non-covalently bound to ASK1 even in the absence of hydrogen peroxide and conferred partial cytoprotection. Interestingly, mutations of peripheral redox sites (C46A and C53A) and M26I also led to constitutive ASK1 binding. Cytoprotective [wt]DJ-1 bound to the ASK1 N terminus (which is known to bind another negative regulator, thioredoxin 1), whereas [M26I]DJ-1 bound to aberrant C-terminal site(s). Consequently, the peripheral cysteine mutants retained cytoprotective activity, whereas the PD-associated mutant [M26I]DJ-1 failed to suppress ASK1 activity and nuclear export of the death domain-associated protein Daxx and did not promote cytoprotection. Thus, cytoprotective binding of DJ-1 to ASK1 depends on the central redox-sensitive Cys-106 and may be modulated by peripheral cysteine residues. We suggest that impairments in oxidative conformation changes of DJ-1 might contribute to PD neurodegeneration.",

The functions of these hydrogen bonds have been examined with a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography. The hydroxyl group of Y6 has a normal pKa of about 10 even though it is shielded from solvent and is in a largely hydrophobic environment. The apparent pKa of GSH in the binary Y6F.GSH complex is increased by 1.6 log units, and the reactivity of the enzyme-bound nucleophile is reduced. The catalytic properties of the Y6L mutant are identical to those of Y6F, suggesting that the weakly polar on-edge interaction between the aromatic ring and sulfur has no influence on catalysis. The refined three-dimensional structure of the Y6F mutant in complex with GSH shows no major structural perturbation of the protein other than a change in the coordination environment of the sulfur. Removal of the second-sphere influence of the on-face hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups T13 as in the T13V and T13A mutants elevates the pKa of enzyme-bound GSH by about 0.7 pKa units. Crystal structures of these mutants show that structural changes in the active site are minor and suggest that the changes in pKa of E.GSH are due to the presence or absence of the on-face hydrogen bond. The T13S mutant has a completely different side-chain hydrogen-bonding geometry than T13 in the native enzyme and catalytic properties similar to the T13A and T13V mutants consistent with the absence of an on-face hydrogen bond. The gamma-methyl group of T13 is essential in enforcing the on-face hydrogen bond geometry and preventing the hydroxyl group from forming more favorable conventional hydrogen bonds.",

In the present study, residues forming the hydrophobic substrate-binding site (H-site) of a Delta class enzyme were investigated in detail for the first time by site-directed mutagenesis and crystallographic studies. Enzyme kinetics reveal that Tyr111 indirectly stabilizes GSH binding, Tyr119 modulates hydrophobic substrate binding and Phe123 indirectly modulates catalysis. Mutations at Tyr111 and Phe123 also showed evidence for positive co-operativity for GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene respectively, strongly suggesting a role for these residues in manipulating subunit-subunit communication. In the present paper we report crystal structures of the wild-type enzyme, and two mutants, in complex with S-hexylglutathione. This study has identified an aromatic 'zipper' in the H-site contributing a network of aromatic pi-pi interactions. Several residues of the cluster directly interact with the hydrophobic substrate, whereas others indirectly maintain conformational stability of the dimeric structure through the C-terminal domain (domain II). The Y119E mutant structure shows major main-chain rearrangement of domain II. This reorganization is moderated through the 'zipper' that contributes to the H-site remodelling, thus illustrating a role in co-substrate binding modulation. The F123A structure shows molecular rearrangement of the H-site in one subunit, but not the other, explaining weakened hydrophobic substrate binding and kinetic co-operativity effects of Phe123 mutations. The three crystal structures provide comprehensive evidence of the aromatic 'zipper' residues having an impact upon protein stability, catalysis and specificity. Consequently, 'zipper' residues appear to modulate and co-ordinate substrate processing through permissive flexing.",

J. 293, 31-34]. Furthermore, elevation of cAMP levels in adipocytes also increases the level of Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity to a similar extent, providing a mechanistic link between elevated cAMP and the inhibition of protein synthesis [Diggle, Redpath, Heesom and Denton (1998) Biochem. J. 336, 525-529]. Here we describe the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-eEF-2K fusion protein and the identification of two serine residues that are phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Endoproteinase Arg-C digestion of GST-eEF-2K produced two phosphopeptides that were separated by HPLC and sequenced. (32)P Radioactivity release from these peptides indicated that the sites of phosphorylation were Ser-365 and Ser-499, both of which lie C-terminal to the catalytic domain. Mutation of these sites to non-phosphorylatable residues indicated that both sites need to be phosphorylated to induce Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity in vitro. However, expression of Myc-tagged eEF-2K in HEK 293 cells, followed by treatment with chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), showed that Ser-499 phosphorylation alone induced Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity in cells. Co-expression of wild-type eEF-2K with luciferase resulted in a 2-3-fold reduction in luciferase expression. Expression of eEF-2K S499D resulted in a 10-fold reduction in luciferase expression despite the fact that this mutant was expressed at very low levels. This indicates that eEF-2K S499D is constitutively active when expressed in cells, thus leading to the suppression of its own expression. Our data demonstrate an important role for the phosphorylation of Ser-499 in the activation of eEF-2K by PKA and the inhibition of protein synthesis.",

ErbB3 also has a proline-rich sequence that forms a consensus binding site for the SH3 domain of p85. Here we have investigated the interacting domains of ErbB3 and p85 by a unique application of the yeast two-hybrid system. A chimaeric ErbB3 molecule containing the epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase domain was developed so that the C-terminal domain of ErbB3 could become phosphorylated in the yeast system. We also generated several ErbB3 deletion and Tyr-->Phe site-specific mutants, and observed that a single ErbB3 YXXM motif was necessary and sufficient for the association of ErbB3 with p85. The incorporation of multiple YXXM motifs into the ErbB3 C-terminus enabled a stronger ErbB3/p85 interaction. The proline-rich region of ErbB3 was not necessary for interaction with p85. However, either deletion or mutation of the p85 SH3 domain decreased the observed ErbB3/p85 association. Additionally an ErbB3/p85 SH3 domain interaction was detected by an assay in vitro. These results were consistent with a model in which pairs of phosphorylated ErbB3 YXXM motifs co-operate in binding to the tandem SH2 domains of p85. Although a contributing role for the p85 SH3 domain was suggested, the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains seemed to be primarily responsible for the high-affinity association of p85 and ErbB3.",

Previous studies have shown that DOCK180 and ELMO comprise an unconventional bipartite Dbl homology domain-independent Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rac-GEF); but it is still unclear how CrkII functions in Rac-GEF activity. In this study, we have characterized a unique function of CrkII in phagocytosis and Rac activation mediated by the C-terminal SH3 domain, a region of CrkII that has no clear cellular or biochemical function. We found that mutations that disrupt the C-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII (CrkII-SH3-C) abrogate engulfment of apoptotic cells and impair cell spreading on extracellular matrix. Surprisingly, despite the effects on engulfment, W276K CrkII strongly potentiated Rac-GTP loading when ectopically expressed in HEK 293T cells. Contrary to the effects of the true dominant negative SH2 domain mutants (R38K CrkII) and SH3-N domain mutants (W170K CrkII) that prevent macromolecular assembly of signaling proteins, W276K CrkII increases association between DOCK180 and CrkII as well as constitutive tethering of the Crk/DOCK180/ELMO protein complex that interacted with RhoG. Our results indicate that while N-terminal SH3 of CrkII promotes assembly between CrkII and DOCK180, the C-terminal SH3 of CrkII regulates the stability and turnover of the DOCK180/ELMO complex. Studies with W276K CrkII may offer a unique opportunity to study the structure and function of the DOCK180/ELMO Rac-GEF.",

Here we identify the interacting binding domains of endothelial CLCA proteins (e.g. hCLCA2, mCLCA5, mCLCA1, and bCLCA2) and beta4 integrin. Endothelial CLCAs share a common beta4-binding motif (beta4BM) in their 90- and 35-kDa subunits of the sequence F(S/N)R(I/L/V)(S/T)S, which is located in the second extracellular domain of the 90-kDa CLCA and near the N terminus of the 35-kDa CLCA, respectively. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays, we showed that glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of beta4BMs from the 90- and 35-kDa CLCA subunits bind to the beta4 integrin in a metal ion-dependent manner. Fusion proteins from fibronectin and the integrins beta1 and beta3 served as negative controls. beta4BM fusion proteins competitively blocked the beta4/CLCA adhesion and prevented lung colonization of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. A disrupted beta4BM in hCLCA1, which is not expressed in endothelia, failed to interact with beta4 integrin. The corresponding CLCA-binding domain of the beta4 integrin is localized to the specific determining loop (SDL). Again enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays were used to confirm the interaction with CLCA proteins using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein representing the C-terminal two-thirds of beta4 SDL (amino acids 184-203). A chimeric beta4 integrin in which the indicated SDL sequence had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the beta1 integrin failed to bind hCLCA2. The dominance of the CLCA ligand in beta4 activation and outside-in signaling is discussed in reference to our previous report that beta4/CLCA ligation elicits selective signaling via focal adhesion kinase to promote metastatic growth.",

Using CHO cells transfected with various beta3 mutants, we demonstrate a close correlation between alphav beta3-mediated cell spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, and highlight a distinct involvement of the NPLY747 and NITY759 motifs in these signaling processes. Deletion of the NITY759 motif alone was sufficient to completely prevent alphav beta3-dependent focal contact formation, cell spreading, and FAK/paxillin phosphorylation. The single Y759A substitution induced a strong inhibitory phenotype, while the more conservative, but still phosphorylation-defective, Y759F mutation restored wild type receptor function. Alanine substitution of the highly conserved Tyr747 completely abolished alphav beta3-dependent formation of focal adhesion plaques, cell spreading, and FAK/paxillin phosphorylation, whereas a Y747F substitution only partially restored these events. As none of these mutations affected receptor-ligand interaction, our results suggest that the structural integrity of the NITY759 motif, rather than the phosphorylation status of Tyr759 is important for beta3-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, while the presence of Tyr at residue 747 within the NPLY747 motif is required for optimal beta3 post-ligand binding events.",

Phosphorylation of serines 259 and 621 in C-Raf and serines 364 and 728 in B-Raf has been suggested to be critical for association with 14-3-3 proteins. To study the functional consequences of Raf phosphorylations at these positions, we developed and characterized phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding epitopes: a monoclonal phosphospecific antibody (6B4) directed against pS621 and a polyclonal antibody specific for B-Raf-pS364 epitope. Although 6B4 detected both C- and B-Raf in Western blots, it specifically recognizes the native form of C-Raf but not B-Raf. Contrary to B-Raf, a kinase-dead mutant of C-Raf was found to be only poorly phosphorylated in the Ser-621 position. Moreover, serine 259 to alanine mutation prevented the Ser-621 phosphorylation suggesting an interdependence between these two 14-3-3 binding domains. Direct C-Raf.14-3-3 binding studies with purified proteins combined with competition assays revealed that the 14-3-3 binding domain surrounding pS621 represents the high affinity binding site, whereas the pS259 epitope mediates lower affinity binding. Raf isozymes differ in their 14-3-3 association rates. The time course of endogenous C-Raf activation in mammalian cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) has been examined using both phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding sites (6B4 and anti-pS259) as well as phosphospecific antibodies directed against the activation domain (anti-pS338 and anti-pY340/pY341). Time course of Ser-621 phosphorylation, in contrast to Ser-259 phosphorylation, exhibited unexpected pattern reaching maximal phosphorylation within 30 s of NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 340/341 reached maximal levels subsequent to Ser-621 phosphorylation and was coincident with emergence of kinase activity. Taken together, we found substantial differences between C-Raf.14-3-3 binding epitopes pS259 and pS621 and visualized for the first time the sequence of the essential C-Raf phosphorylation events in mammalian cells in response to growth factor stimulation.",

This study focuses on Rap1GAP, which selectively interacts with Galpha(o) and Galpha(i) but not with Galpha(s) or Galpha(q). Rap1GAP interacts more avidly with the unactivated Galpha(o) as compared with the mutant (Q205L)-activated Galpha(o). When expressed in HEK-293 cells, unactivated Galpha(o) co-immunoprecipitates with the Rap1GAP. Expression of chick Rap1GAP in PC-12 cells inhibited activation of Rap1 by forskolin. When unactivated Galpha(o) was expressed, the amount of activated Rap1 was greatly increased. This effect was not observed with the Q205L-Galpha(o). Expression of unactivated Galpha(o) stimulated MAP-kinase (MAPK1/2) activity in a Rap1GAP-dependent manner. These results identify a novel function of Galpha(o), which in its resting state can sequester Rap1GAP thereby regulating Rap1 activity and consequently gating signal flow from Rap1 to MAPK1/2. Thus, activation of G(o) could modulate the Rap1 effects on a variety of cellular functions.",

Mdm2 amplification in benign tumors suggests that it is not sufficient for p53 inactivation in cancer, implying that other defects in the p53 pathway are required for malignancy. We investigated mechanisms of wtp53 protein inactivation in malignant conversion of epithelial cells by comparing clonally related initiated cells with their derivative cancerous cells that have mdm2 amplification. Deficiencies in p53 accumulation and activities in response to DNA damage were not due simply to Mdm2 destabilization of p53 protein, but to continued association of DNA-bound p53 with Mdm2 protein and lack of binding and acetylation by p300 protein. The aberrant interactions were not because of mdm2 amplification alone, because DNA-bound p53 protein from initiated cells failed to bind ectopically expressed Mdm2 or endogenous overexpressed Mdm2 from cancerous cells. Phosphorylations of endogenous p53 at Ser18, -23, or -37 were insufficient to dissociate Mdm2, because each was induced by UV in cancerous cells. Interestingly, phospho-mimic p53-T21E did dissociate the Mdm2 protein from DNA-bound p53 and recovered p300 binding and p21 induction in the cancerous cells. Thus wtp53 in malignant cells with mdm2 amplification can be inactivated by continued association of DNA-bound p53 protein with Mdm2 and failure of p300 binding and acetylation, coupled with a defect in p53 phosphorylation at Thr21. These findings suggest therapeutic strategies that address both p53/Mdm2 interaction and associated p53 protein defects in human tumors that have amplified mdm2 genes.",

To extend our understanding of these interactions, we characterized properties of ALF, a germ cell-specific TFIIA-like factor. ALF was able to stabilize the binding of TBP to DNA, but it could not stabilize TBP mutants A184E, N189E, E191R, and R205E nor could it facilitate binding of the TBP-like factor TRF2/TLF to a consensus TATA element. However, phosphorylation of ALF with casein kinase II resulted in the partial restoration of complex formation using mutant TBPs. Studies of ALF-TBP complexes formed on the Adenovirus Major Late (AdML) promoter revealed protection of the TATA box and upstream sequences from -38 to -20 (top strand) and -40 to -22 (bottom strand). The half-life and apparent K(D) of this complex was determined to be 650 min and 4.8 +/- 2.7 nm, respectively. The presence of ALF or TFIIA did not significantly alter the ability of TBP to bind TATA elements from several testis-specific genes. Finally, analysis of the distinct, nonhomologous internal regions of ALF and TFIIAalpha/beta using circular dichroism spectroscopy provided the first evidence to suggest that these domains are unordered, a result consistent with other genetic and biochemical properties. Overall, the results show that while the sequence and regulation of the ALF gene are distinct from its somatic cell counterpart TFIIAalpha/beta, the TFIIAgamma-dependent interactions of these factors with TBP are nearly indistinguishable in vitro. Thus, a role for ALF in the assembly and stabilization of initiation complexes in germ cells is likely to be similar or identical to the role of TFIIA in somatic cells.",

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that Grb2, an adaptor protein, specifically interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma1 at Tyr783. The association of Grb2 with PLC-gamma1 was induced by the treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Replacement of Tyr783 with Phe completely blocked EGF-induced interaction of PLC-gamma1 with Grb2, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1 at Tyr783 is essential for the interaction with Grb2. Interestingly, the depletion of Grb2 from HEK-293 cells by RNA interference significantly enhanced increased EGF-induced PLC-gamma1 enzymatic activity and mobilization of the intracellular Ca2+, while it did not affect EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1. Furthermore, overexpression of Grb2 inhibited PLC-gamma1 enzymatic activity. Taken together, these results suggest Grb2, in addition to its key function in signaling through Ras, may have a negatively regulatory role on EGF-induced PLC-gamma1 activation.",

In the present study, mutagenesis has been used to study the roles of these phosphorylation events in regulating FKHR function in transfected HEK-293 cells. We find that the overexpression of FKHR[S256A] (where Ser-256-->Ala) blocks PKB activity in cells, preventing phosphorylation of the endogenous substrates FKHRL1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3. Thus some reported effects of overexpression of this and other mutants may be indirect, and result from suppression of the phosphorylation of other sites on FKHR and/or other PKB substrates. For example, we have shown that Thr-24 phosphorylation alone is critical for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, and that the substitution of Ser-256 with an alanine residue indirectly blocks 14-3-3 protein binding by preventing the phosphorylation of Thr-24. We also found that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and serum-induced nuclear exclusion of FKHR[S256A] depends on the degree of overexpression of this mutant. Our results indicated that the interaction of FKHR with 14-3-3 proteins was not required for IGF-1-stimulated exclusion of FKHR from the nucleus. We present evidence in support of another mechanism, which depends on the phosphorylation of Ser-256 and may involve the masking of a nuclear localization signal. Finally, we have demonstrated that the failure of IGF-1 to suppress transactivation by FKHR[S256A] is not explained entirely by its failure to bind 14-3-3 proteins or to undergo nuclear exclusion. This result suggests that Ser-256 phosphorylation may also suppress transactivation by FKHR by yet another mechanism, perhaps by disrupting the interaction of FKHR with target DNA binding sites and/or the function of the transactivation domain.",

Mutations in transcription factor FOXP2 cause difficulties mastering fluent speech (developmental verbal dyspraxia, DVD), whereas mutations of sushi-repeat protein SRPX2 lead to epilepsy of the rolandic (sylvian) speech areas, with DVD or with bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. Pathophysiological mechanisms driven by SRPX2 involve modified interaction with the plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Independent chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray screening has identified the uPAR gene promoter as a potential target site bound by FOXP2. Here, we directly tested for the existence of a transcriptional regulatory network between human FOXP2 and the SRPX2/uPAR complex. In silico searches followed by gel retardation assays identified specific efficient FOXP2-binding sites in each of the promoter regions of SRPX2 and uPAR. In FOXP2-transfected cells, significant decreases were observed in the amounts of both SRPX2 (43.6%) and uPAR (38.6%) native transcripts. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that FOXP2 expression yielded a marked inhibition of SRPX2 (80.2%) and uPAR (77.5%) promoter activity. A mutant FOXP2 that causes DVD (p.R553H) failed to bind to SRPX2 and uPAR target sites and showed impaired down-regulation of SRPX2 and uPAR promoter activity. In a patient with polymicrogyria of the left rolandic operculum, a novel FOXP2 mutation (p.M406T) was found in the leucine-zipper (dimerization) domain. p.M406T partially impaired the FOXP2 regulation of SRPX2 promoter activity, whereas that of the uPAR promoter remained unchanged.

Unlabeled HLf and BLf displaced the 125I-HLf-bacteria interaction in a dose-dependent manner. The Lf-bacterium complex was uncoupled by KSCN or urea, but not by NaCl. The interaction was specific, and approximately 4,800 HLf binding sites (affinity constant [Ka], 690 nM) or approximately 5,700 BLf binding sites (Ka, 104 nM) per cell were estimated in strain M90T by a Scatchard plot analysis. The native cell envelope (CE) and outer membrane (OM) did not reveal Lf-binding components in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, after being boiled, the CE and OM preparations showed three distinct horseradish peroxidase-Lf reactive bands of about 39, 22, and 16 kDa. The 39-kDa component was also reactive to a monoclonal antibody specific for porin (PoI) proteins of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The Lf-binding protein pattern was similar with BLf or HLf, for Crb+ and Crb- strains. The protein-Lf complex was dissociable by KSCN or urea and was stable after treatment with NaCl. Variation (loss) in the O chain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) markedly enhanced the Lf-binding capacity in the isogenic rough strain SFL1070-15 compared with its smooth parent strain, SFL1070.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the role of the cytoplasmic domain of the GP Ib-IX complex and its interaction with the cytoskeleton. Cultured cells were transfected with the cDNAs coding for GP Ib(beta), GP IX, and full-length or truncated forms of GP Ib(alpha). Western blots of detergent-insoluble fractions of Triton X-100-lysed cells showed that deletion of amino acids Trp-570 to Ser-590 from the cytoplasmic domain of GP IB(alpha) abolished the interaction of the entire GP Ib-IX complex with the cytoskeleton. Truncated GP Ib(alpha) that was unable to associate with the cytoskeleton retained its ability to associate with GP Ib(beta), to be inserted into the membrane, and to bind von Willebrand factor. Cells expressing GP Ib(alpha) changed their shape following adhesion to immobilized von Willebrand factor. Cells expressing truncated GP Ib(alpha) also changed their shape following adhesion but showed a very different morphology as compared to cells expressing full-length GP Ib(alpha). These results show that GP Ib-IX-von Willebrand factor interactions lead to cytoskeletal reorganizations, that the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib(alpha) regulates these reorganizations, and that the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib(alpha) is absolutely required for attachment of the GP Ib-IX complex to the cytoskeleton.",

Based on its association with cTnI, we hypothesized that PKCzeta is a major regulator of myofilament protein phosphorylation. To test this, we infected adult cardiac myocytes with adenoviral constructs containing DsRed monomer-tagged wild type (WT) and the following constitutively active forms of PKCzeta: the pseudo-substrate region (A119E), 3'-phospho-inositide-dependent kinase-1 (T410E), and auto-phosphorylation (T560E). The A119E and T410E mutants displayed increased localization to the Z-discs compared with WT and T560E. Immunoprecipitations were performed in myocytes expressing PKCzeta using PKC phospho-motif antibodies to determine the phosphorylation of cTnI, cTnT, tropomyosin, myosin-binding protein C, and desmin. We did not find serine (Ser) phosphorylation of cTnI or cTnT. However, we observed a significant decrease in threonine (Thr) phosphorylation of cTnI and cTnT notably by PKCzeta T560E. Ser phosphorylation of tropomyosin was increased by all three active mutants of PKCzeta. Ser/Thr phosphorylation of myosin-binding protein C increased primarily by PKCzeta A119E. Both PKCzeta A119E and T410E mutants increased desmin Ser/Thr phosphorylation. To explain the apparent Thr dephosphorylation of cTnI and cTnT, we hypothesized that PKCzeta exists as a complex with p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and this was confirmed by immunoprecipitation Western blot.

In order to identify the precise actin-binding regions in p57, and to assess the contribution of these structural motifs, we prepared various truncated p57 as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and examined their actin-binding activity. A co-sedimentation assay demonstrated that p57(1-371) (C-terminal truncated p57) had the ability to bind F-actin, but p57(372-461) (a fragment containing the coiled-coil motif) did not. A segment consisting of the N-terminal 34 amino acids of p57 (p57(1-34)) was found to bind to F-actin in the co-sedimentation assay. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopic observation showed that p57(1-34) was co-localized with F-actin in COS-1 cells after the transfection with the p57(1-34) construct. Deletion of (10)KFRHVF(15), a sequence conserved among coronin-related proteins, from p57(1-34) abolished its actin-binding activity, suggesting that this sequence with basic and hydrophobic amino acids is crucial for p57 to bind to F-actin. However, the N-terminal deletion mutant p57(63-461) retained the binding ability to F-actin. This result suggests the presence of a second actin-binding region. Further deletion analysis revealed that p57(111-204), which includes the second and third WD repeats, also exhibited weak actin-binding activity in the co-sedimentation assay. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that at least two regions within Met-1 to Asp-34 and Ile-111 to Glu-204 of p57 are responsible for its binding to the actin cytoskeleton.",

The present report assessed whether the negative activity imparted by the aPTH VDRE could be converted to a positive transcriptional response through selective mutations introduced into the element. The tested sequences were derived from individual and combined mutations to 2 bp in the 3'-half of the direct repeat element, GGGTCAggaGGGTGT. Cold competition experiments using mutant and wild-type oligonucleotides in the mobility shift assay revealed minor differences in the ability of any of these sequences to compete for binding to a heterodimer complex comprised of recombinant proteins. Ethylation interference footprint analysis for each of the mutants produced unique patterns over the 3'-half-sites that were distinct from the weak, wild-type footprint. Transcriptional outcomes evaluated from a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct utilizing the aPTH promoter found that the individual T-->A mutant produced an attenuated negative transcriptional response while the G-->C mutant resulted in a reproducibly weak positive transcriptional outcome. The double mutant, however, yielded a 4-fold increase in transcription, similar to the 7-fold increase observed from an analogous construct using the human osteocalcin VDRE. UV light crosslinking to gapped oligonucleotides assessed the polarity of heterodimer binding to the wild-type and double mutant sequences and was consistent with the vitamin D receptor preferentially binding to the 5'-half of both elements. Finally, DNA affinity chromatography was used to immobilize heterodimer complexes bound to the wild-type and double mutant sequences as bait to identify proteins that may preferentially interact with these DNA-bound heterodimers. This analysis revealed the presence of a p160 protein that specifically interacted with the heterodimer bound to the wild-type VDRE, but was absent from complexes bound to response elements associated with positive transcriptional activity. Thus, the sequence of the individual VDRE appears to play an active role in dictating transcriptional responses that may be mediated by altering the ability of a vitamin D receptor heterodimer to interact with accessory factor proteins.",

          "text": "INTRODUCTION: Progesterone receptors (PR) are emerging as important breast cancer drivers. Phosphorylation events common to breast cancer cells impact PR transcriptional activity, in part by direct phosphorylation. PR-B but not PR-A isoforms are phosphorylated on Ser294 by mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Phospho-Ser294 PRs are resistant to ligand-dependent Lys388 SUMOylation (that is, a repressive modification). Antagonism of PR small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation by mitogenic protein kinases suggests a mechanism for derepression (that is, transcriptional activation) of target genes. As a broad range of PR protein expression is observed clinically, a PR gene signature would provide a valuable marker of PR contribution to early breast cancer progression. METHODS: Global gene expression patterns were measured in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing either wild-type (SUMOylation-capable) or K388R (SUMOylation-deficient) PRs and subjected to pathway analysis. Gene sets were validated by RT-qPCR. Recruitment of coregulators and histone methylation levels were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Changes in cell proliferation and survival were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and western blotting. Finally, human breast tumor cohort datasets were probed to identify PR-associated gene signatures; metagene analysis was employed to define survival rates in patients whose tumors express a PR gene signature. RESULTS: 'SUMO-sensitive' PR target genes primarily include genes required for proliferative and pro-survival signaling. DeSUMOylated K388R receptors are preferentially recruited to enhancer regions of derepressed genes (that is, MSX2, RGS2, MAP1A, and PDK4) with the steroid receptor coactivator, CREB-(cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP), and mixed lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2), a histone methyltransferase mediator of nucleosome remodeling. PR SUMOylation blocks these events, suggesting that SUMO modification of PR prevents interactions with mediators of early chromatin remodeling at 'closed' enhancer regions. SUMO-deficient (phospho-Ser294) PR gene signatures are significantly associated with human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2)-positive luminal breast tumors and predictive of early metastasis and shortened survival. Treatment with antiprogestin or MEK inhibitor abrogated expression of SUMO-sensitive PR target-genes and inhibited proliferation in BT-474 (estrogen receptor (ER)+/PR+/ERBB2+) breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reversible PR SUMOylation/deSUMOylation profoundly alters target gene selection in breast cancer cells. Phosphorylation-induced PR deSUMOylation favors a permissive chromatin environment via recruitment of CBP and MLL2. Patients whose ER+/PR+ tumors are driven by hyperactive (that is, derepressed) phospho-PRs may benefit from endocrine (antiestrogen) therapies that contain an antiprogestin.",

The vast majority of HRPT2/CDC73 germline mutations identified have been truncation or frameshift mutations, and loss of function due to missense mutation is rare. We report here a kindred with HPT-JT due to a germline L95P missense mutation in parafibromin. The mutant parafibromin was studied in vitro to understand the basis of its presumed loss-of-function. When transfected in cultured cells, the L95P mutant was expressed to a lower level than wild-type (wt) parafibromin, a difference that was not overcome by inhibition of the proteasomal degradation pathway. The L95P mutant parafibromin retained the ability to assemble with endogenous PAF1 complex components as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation. Analysis of subcellular localization showed that the L95P mutant was markedly deficient in nucleolar localization compared to the wt, an impairment likely resulting from disruption of a putative nucleolar localization signal immediately upstream of the L95P mutation. Transfection of the L95P parafibromin mutant, but not the wt, enhanced cell cycle progression and increased cell survival in NIH-3T3 and HEK 293 cells, resulting apparently from dominant interference with endogenous parafibromin action. The simultaneous loss of nucleolar localization and acquisition of a growth stimulatory phenotype with the L95P mutation raise the possibility that parafibromin must interact with targets in the nucleolus to fully execute its tumor suppressor functions.",

These cells showed typical characteristics of apoptosis, when they were cultured at 32 degrees C. In this process, p53 recovered the wild-type p53 function and the expression of the p21 (waf1/cip1/sdi1), cyclin G1 and gadd45 genes was increased. However, no significant changes were detected in the expression of the mdm2, bcl-2, bax, fas and fasl genes, suggesting the existence of other genes associated with apoptosis. Genes up-regulated by p53 were screened by the mRNA differential display method. One of the up-regulated genes was identified as the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) gene. EF-1 alpha is also a microtubule-severing protein. Upon the temperature-shift, the cells developed the morphology and the localization of alpha-tubulin similar to those of the cells treated with vincristine, a drug that affects microtubules. The microtubule-severing associated with up-regulation of EF-1 alpha by p53 may be a cause of the cell death. On the other hand, the function of cyclin G1 is not so clear despite the fact that 1-2-3 cells showed a significant increase of the cyclin G1 gene during the early stage of apoptosis. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify cyclin G1-associated proteins. One is a cytochrome c (Cyt c) oxidase subunit II (COXII). Cyclin G1 and COXII were co-immunoprecipitated from an extract of human osteosarcoma cell line that expressed high levels of cyclin G1. COX activity was also increased by temperature-shift in this cell line. The pattern of changes in COX activity was closely reflected by the expression of the cyclin G1 gene. Cyclin G1 and COXII associate physically with each other in vivo and that activation of COXII by binding to cyclin G1 upregulated by p53 may be associated with apoptosis. These two new pathways, p53-EF-1 alpha-microtubule-severing (-distortion of cytoskeleton) and p53-cyclin G1-COXII (-CytC, ATP-caspase-3 activation), may cooperate to induce apoptosis in this cell line.",

Our data show that kinases of S. commersonii differentially recognize the VPg containing Ser or Leu at position 185, whereas both forms of VPg are similarly recognized by tobacco kinases.

Human alpha(v)beta(3) integrins are receptors for several pathogenic hantaviruses, and the function of alpha(v)beta(3) integrins on endothelial cells suggests a role for alpha(v)beta(3) in hantavirus directed vascular permeability. We determined here that ANDV infection of human endothelial cells or Syrian hamster-derived BHK-21 cells was selectively inhibited by the high-affinity alpha(v)beta(3) integrin ligand vitronectin and by antibodies to alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Further, antibodies to the beta(3) integrin PSI domain, as well as PSI domain polypeptides derived from human and Syrian hamster beta(3) subunits, but not murine or bovine beta(3), inhibited ANDV infection of both BHK-21 and human endothelial cells. These findings suggest that ANDV interacts with beta(3) subunits through PSI domain residues conserved in both Syrian hamster and human beta(3) integrins. Sequencing the Syrian hamster beta(3) integrin PSI domain revealed eight differences between Syrian hamster and human beta(3) integrins. Analysis of residues within the PSI domains of human, Syrian hamster, murine, and bovine beta(3) integrins identified unique proline substitutions at residues 32 and 33 of murine and bovine PSI domains that could determine ANDV recognition. Mutagenizing the human beta(3) PSI domain to contain the L33P substitution present in bovine beta(3) integrin abolished the ability of the PSI domain to inhibit ANDV infectivity. Conversely, mutagenizing either the bovine PSI domain, P33L, or the murine PSI domain, S32P, to the residue present human beta(3) permitted PSI mutants to inhibit ANDV infection. Similarly, CHO cells transfected with the full-length bovine beta(3) integrin containing the P33L mutation permitted infection by ANDV. These findings indicate that human and Syrian hamster alpha(v)beta(3) integrins are key receptors for ANDV and that specific residues within the beta(3) integrin PSI domain are required for ANDV infection. Since L33P is a naturally occurring human beta(3) polymorphism, these findings further suggest the importance of specific beta(3) integrin residues in hantavirus infection. These findings rationalize determining the role of beta(3) integrins in hantavirus pathogenesis in the Syrian hamster model.",

Knock-out of p53 markedly reduced HDACi-induced apoptosis. Unexpectedly, expression of transactivation-deficient p53 variants sensitized p53-null cells to HDACi-mediated BAX-dependent apoptosis, whereas knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 in cancer cells reduced HDACi-mediated cytotoxicity. Evaluation of the mechanisms controlling this response led to the discovery of a novel interaction between p53 and Ku70. The association between these two proteins was acetylation-independent, but acetylation of p53 could prevent and disrupt the Ku70-BAX complex and enhance apoptosis. These results suggest a new mechanism of acetylated p53 transcription-independent regulation of apoptosis.",

In contrast, mutation of c-Fms Tyr-559 to Phe blocks M-CSF-induced cytoskeletal reorganization by inhibiting formation of a Src Family Kinase SFK.c-Cbl.PI3K complex and the downstream activation of Vav3 and Rac, two key mediators of actin remodeling. Using an add-back approach in which specific Tyr residues are reinserted into c-Fms inactivated by the absence of all seven functionally important Tyr residues, we find that Tyr-559 is necessary but not sufficient to transduce M-CSF-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization. Furthermore, this same add-back approach identifies important roles for Tyr-697 and Tyr-721 in collaborating with Tyr-559 to recruit a multimeric signaling complex that can transduce signals from c-Fms to the actin cytoskeleton.",

Here we show that the SH2 domain of Grb7 can directly bind to the autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptor in vitro. Grb7 association to the PDGF beta-receptor was dramatically reduced by replacement of tyrosine residues 716 or 775 with phenylalanine residues. Synthetic phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr-716 or Tyr-775 inhibited binding of the Grb7 SH2 domain to the autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptor in a manner similar to but distinct from the binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain. Grb7 associated with activated PDGF beta-receptors in vivo, and the association was dramatically reduced by substitution of Tyr-716 or Tyr-775 with a phenylalanine residue. Furthermore, complex formation between Shc and Grb7 was observed after ligand stimulation of PDGF alpha- or beta-receptors in cells transfected with Grb7 cDNA or in the breast cancer cell line BT-474.

The equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of wild type (wt) PTEN to PS and PI(4,5)P(2) were determined to be K(d)\u223c12 \u00b5M and 0.4 \u00b5M, respectively, and K(d)\u223c50 nM if both lipids are present.

While C124S PTEN has at least the same affinity to PI(4,5)P(2) and an increased apparent affinity to PI(3,4,5)P(3), due to its lack of catalytic activity, H93R PTEN shows a decreased affinity to PI(4,5)P(2) and no synergy in its binding with PS and PI(4,5)P(2). Neutron reflection measurements show that the PTEN phosphatase \"scoots\" along the membrane surface (penetration <5 \u00c5) but binds the membrane tightly with its two major domains, the C2 and phosphatase domains, as suggested by the crystal structure. The regulatory C-terminal tail is most likely displaced from the membrane and organized on the far side of the protein, \u223c60 \u00c5 away from the bilayer surface, in a rather compact structure.

Transient overexpression of RIC171, similar to overexpression of CA RACB-G15V, rendered epidermal cells more susceptible to penetration by Bgh.

A red fluorescing DsRED-RIC171 fusion protein colocalized with green fluorescing GFP-RACB-G15V at the cell periphery.

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Understanding the biochemical mechanisms contributing to melanoma development and progression is critical for therapeutical intervention. LKB1 is a multi-task Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates AMPK controlling cell growth and apoptosis under metabolic stress conditions. Additionally, LKB1(Ser428) becomes phosphorylated in a RAS-Erk1/2-p90(RSK) pathway dependent manner. However, the connection between the RAS pathway and LKB1 is mostly unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the UV induced HGF transgenic mouse melanoma model to investigate the interplay among HGF signaling, RAS pathway and PI3K pathway in melanoma, we identified LKB1 as a protein directly modified by HGF induced signaling. A variety of molecular techniques and tissue culture revealed that LKB1(Ser428) (Ser431 in the mouse) is constitutively phosphorylated in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cell lines and spontaneous mouse tumors with high RAS pathway activity. Interestingly, BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells showed a very limited response to metabolic stress mediated by the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. Here we show for the first time that RAS pathway activation including BRAF(V600E) mutation promotes the uncoupling of AMPK from LKB1 by a mechanism that appears to be independent of LKB1(Ser428) phosphorylation. Notably, the inhibition of the RAS pathway in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells recovered the complex formation and rescued the LKB1-AMPKalpha metabolic stress-induced response, increasing apoptosis in cooperation with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bim, and the down-regulation of Mcl-1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate that growth factor treatment and in particular oncogenic BRAF(V600E) induces the uncoupling of LKB1-AMPKalpha complexes providing at the same time a possible mechanism in cell proliferation that engages cell growth and cell division in response to mitogenic stimuli and resistance to low energy conditions in tumor cells. Importantly, this mechanism reveals a new level for therapeutical intervention particularly relevant in tumors harboring a deregulated RAS-Erk1/2 pathway.",

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Signaling by transmembrane receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) occurs at the cell surface and throughout the endocytic pathway, and signaling from the cell surface may differ in magnitude and downstream output from intracellular signaling. As a result, the rate at which signaling molecules traverse the endocytic pathway makes a significant contribution to downstream output. Modulation of the core endocytic machinery facilitates differential uptake of individual cargoes. Clathrin-coated pits are a major entry portal where assembled clathrin forms a lattice around invaginating buds that have captured endocytic cargo. Clathrin assembles into triskelia composed of three clathrin heavy chains and associated clathrin light chains (CLCs). Despite the identification of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface over 30 years ago, the functions of CLCs in endocytosis have been elusive. RESULTS: In this work, we identify a novel role for CLCs in the regulated endocytosis of specific cargoes. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either CLCa or CLCb inhibits the uptake of GPCRs. Moreover, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser204 in CLCb is required for efficient endocytosis of a subset of GPCRs and identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a kinase that can phosphorylate CLCb on Ser204. Overexpression of CLCb(S204A) specifically inhibits the endocytosis of those GPCRs whose endocytosis is GRK2-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that CLCb phosphorylation acts as a discriminator for the endocytosis of specific GPCRs.",

IDH2 was previously shown to contain the catalytic site, whereas IDH1 contributes regulatory properties including cooperativity with respect to isocitrate and allosteric activation by AMP. In this study, interactions between IDH1 and IDH2 were detected using the yeast two-hybrid system, but interactions between identical subunit polypeptides were not detected with this or other methods. A model for heterodimeric interactions between the subunits is therefore proposed for this enzyme. A corollary of this model, based on the three-dimensional structure of the homologous enzyme from Escherichia coli, is that some interactions between subunits occur at isocitrate binding sites. Based on this model, two residues (Lys-183 and Asp-217) in the regulatory IDH1 subunit were predicted to be important in the catalytic site of IDH2. We found that individually replacing these residues with alanine results in mutant enzymes that exhibit a drastic reduction in catalysis both in vitro and in vivo. Also based on this model, the two analogous residues (Lys-189 and Asp-222) of the catalytic IDH2 subunit were predicted to contribute to the regulatory site of IDH1. A K189A substitution in IDH2 was found to produce a decrease in activation of the enzyme by AMP and a loss of cooperativity with respect to isocitrate. A D222A substitution in IDH2 produces similar regulatory defects and a substantial reduction in V(max) in the absence of AMP. Collectively, these results suggest that the basic structural/functional unit of yeast isocitrate dehydrogenase is a heterodimer of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits and that each subunit contributes to the isocitrate binding site of the other.",

LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein kinase containing a central catalytic core and a number of protein-protein interaction domains. An important step forward in the understanding of both the biology and the pathology of LRRK2 would be achieved by identification of its authentic physiological substrates. In the present study we examined phosphorylation of 4E-BP (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein), a recently proposed substrate for LRRKs. We found that LRRK2 is capable of phosphorylating 4E-BP in vitro. The PD related LRRK2-G2019S mutant was approximately 2 fold more active than wild type protein. However, LRRK2 autophosphorylation was stronger than 4E-BP phosphorylation under conditions of molar excess of 4E-BP to LRRK2. We also tested three other kinases (STK3, MAPK14/p38alpha and DAPK2) and found that MAPK14/p38alpha could efficiently phosphorylate 4E-BP at the same site as LRRK2 in vitro. Finally, we did not see changes in 4E-BP phosphorylation levels using inducible expression of LRRK2 in HEK cell lines. We also found that MAPK14/p38alpha phosphorylates 4E-BP in transient overexpression experiments whereas LRRK2 did not. We suggest that increased 4E-BP phosphorylation reported in some systems may be related to p38-mediated cell stress rather than direct LRRK2 activity. Overall, our results suggest that 4E-BP is a relatively poor direct substrate for LRRK2.",

Our previous results showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can potently stimulate gamma-secretase activity through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent pathway. Here, we demonstrate that TNF-alpha triggers JNK-dependent serine/threonine phosphorylation of PS1 and NCT to stimulate gamma-secretase activity. Blocking of JNK activity with a potent JNK inhibitor (SP600125) reduces TNF-alpha-triggered phosphorylation of PS1 and NCT. Consistent with this, we show that activated JNKs can be copurified with gamma-secretase complexes and that active recombinant JNK2 can promote the phosphorylation of PS1 and NCT in vitro. Using site-directed mutagenesis and a synthetic peptide, we clearly show that the Ser(319)Thr(320) motif in PS1 is an important JNK phosphorylation site that is critical for the TNF-alpha-elicited regulation of gamma-secretase. This JNK phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser(319)Thr(320) enhances the stability of the PS1 C-terminal fragment that is necessary for gamma-secretase activity. Together, our findings strongly suggest that JNK is a critical intracellular mediator of TNF-alpha-elicited regulation of gamma-secretase and governs the pivotal step in the assembly of functional gamma-secretase.",

Previous attempts to eliminate this binding by chemical modification yielded ambiguous results and therefore we decided here to produce a double mutant C47S/Y108V by site directed mutagenesis and further expression in Escherichia coli and the interaction of EA and its GSH conjugate (EASG) examined by calorimetric studies and X-ray diffraction.

The Cys-47\u2009\u2192\u2009Ser mutation in the double mutant enzyme induces a positive cooperativity between the two subunits when ligands with affinity to G-site bind to enzyme. However, this mutation does not seem to affect the thermodynamic properties of ligand binding to the electrophilic binding site (H-site) and the thermal or chemical stability of this double mutant does not significantly affect the unfolding mechanism in either the absence or presence of ligand.

Here, the solution and crystal structures determined under near-physiological conditions, as well as a homology model of the hRyR2 N-terminal region, are presented. The N-terminus is held together by a unique network of interactions among its three domains, A, B and C, in which the central helix (amino acids 410-437) plays a prominent stabilizing role.

Although the juxtamembrane domain mutations led to ligand-independent KIT dimerization, the kinase domain mutations (Asp814 --> Val or Tyr) did not. In an effort to determine if the kinase domain mutant could transfer oncogenic signaling without receptor dimerization, we have constructed the truncated types of c-kitWild and c-kitTyr814 cDNAs (c-kitDel-Wild and c-kitDel-Tyr814 cDNAs, respectively), in which ligand-binding and ligand-induced dimerization domains were deleted. When c-kitDel-Wild and c-kitDel-Tyr814 genes were introduced into a murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line Ba/F3, KITDel-Tyr814 was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and activated, whereas KITDel-Wild was not. In addition, Ba/F3 cells expressing KITDel-Tyr814 (Ba/F3(Del-Tyr814)) grew in suspension culture without the addition of exogenous growth factor, whereas Ba/F3 cells expressing KITDel-Wild (Ba/F3(Del-Wild)) required IL-3 for growth. The factor-independent growth of Ba/F3(Del-Tyr814) cells was virtually abrogated by coexpression of KITW42 that is a dominant-negative form of KIT, but not by that of KITWild, suggesting that KITDel-Tyr814 may not function as a monomer but may require receptor dimerization for inducing factor-independent growth. Furthermore, KITDel-Tyr814 was found to be coimmunoprecipitated with KITWild or KITW42 by an ACK2 monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of KIT. Moreover, KITW42 was constitutively associated with a chimeric FMS/KITTyr814 receptor containing the ligand-binding and receptor dimerization domain of c-fms receptor (FMS) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of KITTyr814, but not with a chimeric FMS/KITWild receptor even after stimulation with FMS-ligand. These results suggest that constitutively activating mutation of c-kit at the Asp814 codon may cause a conformation change that leads to receptor self-association not in the extracellular domain and that the receptor self-association of the Asp814 mutant may be important for activation of downstream effectors that are required for factor-independent growth and tumorigenicity.",

          "text": "The disintegrin echistatin inhibits ligand occupancy of the alpha V beta 3 integrin and reduces Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulated migration, DNA synthesis, and receptor autophosphorylation in smooth muscle cells. This suggests that ligand occupancy of the alpha V beta 3 receptor is required for full activation of the IGF-I receptor. Transfection of the full-length beta 3 subunit into CHO cells that have no endogenous beta 3 and do not migrate in response to IGF-I was sufficient for IGF-I to stimulate migration of these anchorage dependent cells. In contrast, transfection of either of two truncated mutant forms of beta 3 (terminating at W(715) or E(731)) or a mutant with substitutions for Tyr(747) Tyr(759) (YY) into either CHO or into porcine smooth muscle cells did not restore the capacity of these cells to migrate across a surface in response to IGF-I. This effect was not due to loss of IGF-I receptor autophosphorylation since the response of the receptor to IGF-I was similar in cells expressing either the full-length or any of the mutant forms of the beta 3 subunit. Echistatin reduced IGF-I receptor phosphorylation in cells expressing the full-length or the YY mutant forms of beta 3 subunit, but it had no effect in cells expressing either of two truncated forms of beta 3. A cell-permeable peptide homologous to the C-terminal region of the beta 3 subunit (amino acids 747-762) reduced IGF-I stimulated migration and receptor autophosphorylation of non-transfected porcine smooth muscle cells. These results demonstrate that the full-length beta 3 with intact tyrosines at positions 747 and 759 is required for CHO cells to migrate in response to IGF-I. Furthermore, a region of critical amino acids between residues 742-762 is required for echistatin to induce its regulatory effect on receptor phosphorylation. Since the IGF-I receptor does not bind to alpha V beta 3 the results suggest that specific but distinct regions of the beta 3 subunit interact with intermediary proteins to facilitate IGF-I stimulated cell migration and echistatin induced inhibition of IGF-I signal transduction.",

The structures of two new complexes with weaker binding ligands chosen based on these results (N-(n-octyl)-GPPPYNH(2) and Ac-PLPPY) comprising the wild-type WW domain of Hu-Yap65 were determined. Comparison of the structures of the three complexes were useful for identifying the molecular basis of high-affinity: hydrophobic and specific interactions between the side-chains of Y28 and W39 and P5' and P4', respectively, and hydrogen bonds between T37 (donnor) and P5' (acceptor) and between W39 (donnor) and T2' (acceptor) stabilize the complex.The structure of the complex L30 K Hu-Yap65 WW domain/GTPPPPYTVG is compared to the published crystal structure of the dystrophin WW domain bound to a segment of the beta-dystroglycan protein and to the solution structure of the first Nedd4 WW domain and its prolin-rich ligand, suggesting that WW sequences bind proline-rich peptides in an evolutionary conserved fashion.

Collaborative studies from our laboratory demonstrated a direct association of 14-3-3 with the meningioma tumor suppressor Protein 4.1B, which was not observed with other members of the Protein 4.1 family, including the NF2 meningioma tumor suppressor, merlin/schwannomin. Given the role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, we sought to determine the functional significance of 14-3-3 binding to Protein 4.1B growth suppression. Based on comparative binding studies performed with additional members of the Protein 4.1 family, we generated specific missense mutations within the minimal growth suppressor fragment of Protein 4.1B (DAL-1, differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung). Complementary in vitro GST affinity chromatography and in vivo interaction experiments demonstrated that the F359Y mutation abrogated binding to 14-3-3, but did not impair DAL-1 binding to other known Protein 4.1B interacting proteins. Similar to wild-type DAL-1, the expression of the F359Y DAL-1 14-3-3-binding mutant resulted in reduced Protein 4.1B-deficient IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN meningioma cell line colony formation. Moreover, similar to wild-type DAL-1, the stable expression of the DAL-1 F359Y mutant significantly reduced cell proliferation in independently isolated IOMM-Lee clones, as assessed by thymidine incorporation. Collectively, these results suggest that binding to 14-3-3 is not essential for the growth suppressor function of Protein 4.1B in meningiomas.",

In this report, we show that Chinese hamster ovary cells that express the integrin alphavbeta3 in the absence of alpha5beta1 demonstrate increased adhesion and migration on fibrinogen. Furthermore, alphavbeta3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen is not augmented by the soluble agonist, MnCl2, suggesting that alphavbeta3 exists in a higher affinity state in these cells. De novo expression of wild-type alpha5beta1 negatively regulates alphavbeta3-mediated adhesion and migration. This effect is not seen with expression of a chimeric alpha5beta1 integrin in which the cytoplasmic portion of the alpha5 integrin subunit is replaced by the cytoplasmic portion of the alpha4 integrin. In addition, it does not require ligation of alpha5beta1 by fibronectin. Cells that express a constitutively active beta3 integrin that contains a point mutation in the conserved membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail, D723R, are resistant to the effect of alpha5beta1 expression. These data provide additional evidence of \"cross-talk\" between the integrins alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3, and support the idea that alpha5beta1 regulates alphavbeta3-mediated ligand binding. This provides a relevant biological mechanism whereby variations in alpha5beta1 expression in vivo may modulate activation of alphavbeta3 to influence its adhesive function.",

A trimeric 75-kDa DJ-1 complex that mass spectrometry shows contained 2-Cys peroxiredoxin also formed and precedes the appearance of the disulfide dimer. These observations may represent peroxiredoxin sensing and transducing the oxidant signal to DJ-1. The dimeric disulfide DJ-1 complex was stabilized by auranofin, suggesting that thioredoxin recycles it in cells. Higher concentrations of H2O2 concomitantly induce DJ-1 Cys-106 hyperoxidation (sulfination or sulfonation) in myocytes, perfused heart, or HEK cells. An oxidation-resistant C53A DJ-1 shows potentiated H2O2-induced Cys-106 hyperoxidation. DJ-1 also forms multiple disulfides with unknown target proteins during H2O2 treatment, the formation of which is also potentiated in cells expressing the C53A mutant. This suggests that the intersubunit disulfide induces a conformational change that limits Cys-106 forming heterodisulfide protein complexes or from hyperoxidizing. High concentrations of H2O2 also induce cell death, with DJ-1 Cys-106 sulfonation appearing causal in these events, as expressionof C53A DJ-1 enhanced both Cys-106 sulfonation and cell death. Nonetheless, expression of the DJ-1 C106A mutant, which fully prevents hyperoxidation, also showed exacerbated cell death responses to H2O2 A rational explanation for these findings is that DJ-1 Cys-106 forms disulfides with target proteins to limit oxidant-induced cell death. However, when Cys-106 is hyperoxidized, formation of these potentially protective heterodimeric disulfide complexes is limited, and so cell death is exacerbated. ",

We further demonstrated that Ubc9 could functionally repress the transcriptional activity of endogenous SOX4 induced by progesterone in T47D cells. The C93S mutant of Ubc9, which abrogates SUMO-1 conjugation activity, did not abolish the ability to repress SOX4 activity.

In this study, we investigated the role of ATF2 phosphorylation in the maintenance of ATF2 stability. Activation of SAPK by forced expression of DeltaMEKK1 increased overall ATF2 ubiquitination, presumably because of the enhanced dimerization of ATF2. Treatment of DeltaMEKK1-expressing cells with okadaic acid led to the increase in N-terminal phosphorylation, protection from ubiquitination, and accumulation of exogenously expressed ATF2, indicating the role of protein phosphatases in balancing the effects of stress kinases. Analysis of ubiquitination and degradation of the constitutively dimerized ATF2 mutant (ATF2(Delta150-248)) showed that activation of JNK or p38 kinase renders ATF2 resistant to ubiquitination and degradation. This effect is mediated by JNK/p38-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 at Thr-69 and Thr-71, because the phosphorylation-deficient mutant (ATF2(Delta150-248-T69A,T71A)) was not protected from ubiquitination and degradation by the activation of SAPK. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid elevated the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced ATF2 level and the extent of its specific N-terminal phosphorylation. Cycloheximide, which activates SAPK, while inhibiting protein synthesis, stabilized endogenous ATF2. However, treatment of cells with the high dose of SB203580, which inhibits JNK and p38 kinase, resulted in efficient degradation of ATF2 in cells exposed to cycloheximide. This degradation was abrogated by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Our findings suggest that N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 dimers protect ATF2 from ubiquitination and degradation. We propose the hypothesis that the balance between SAPK and protein phosphatases affects the duration and magnitude of ATF2 transcriptional output because of the effect on substrate recognition for ubiquitination and degradation.",

Subsequent mutagenesis revealed that Gly-15 (G15A) and Gly-18 (G18A) were critical for Cdc37-Cdk4 complex formation. Gly-15 and Gly-18 of Cdk4 are within the conserved Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif that is required for ATP binding to the kinase. Mutation of either glycine at the equivalent positions of Raf1 (G358A and G361A) also inhibited Cdc37 binding to Raf1. Replacing another conserved residue critical for ATP binding and kinase activity, Lys-35 (K35A), reduced Cdc37-Cdk4 complex formation but to a lesser extent. The interaction of Cdk4 with Cdc37 in vitro was not sensitive to changes in ATP levels. Cell-based assays indicated that Cdk4(G15A) and Cdk4(G18A) were present at the same level as wild type Cdk4. Equivalent amounts of p16 bound to Cdk4(G15A) and Cdk4(G18A) relative to wild type Cdk4, suggesting that Cdk4(G15A) and Cdk4(G18A) adopt significant tertiary structure.

Importantly, overexpression of Cdc37 not only stimulated cyclin D1 binding to wild type Cdk4 but also restored its binding to Cdk4(G15A). Under the same conditions, p16 binding to wild type Cdk4 was suppressed.

The sequence of Ycf3 is conserved in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants and contains three tetratrico-peptide repeats (TPR). TPRs have been shown to function as sites for protein-protein interactions. The mutations Y95A/Y96A and Y142A/W143A in the second and third TPR repeats lead to a modest decrease of PSI, but they prevent photoautotrophic growth and cause enhanced light sensitivity even though the accumulated PSI complex is fully functional. This phenotype can be reversed under anaerobic conditions and appears to be the result of photooxidative damage. A temperature-sensitive ycf3 mutant, generated by random mutagenesis of a conserved region near the N-terminal end of Ycf3, was used in temperature-shift experiments to show that Ycf3 is required for PSI assembly but not for its stability. Immunoblot analysis of thylakoid membranes separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitations shows that Ycf3 interacts directly with the PSI subunits PsaA and PsaD, but not with subunits from other photosynthetic complexes. Thus, Ycf3 appears to act as a chaperone that interacts directly and specifically with at least two of the PSI subunits during assembly of the PSI complex.",

The purified IL4-BP was immobilized via a single biotinylated SH group near the carboxyl end to a biosensor matrix and analysed in real time for interaction with IL-4 and IL-4 variants. IL-4 was bound to IL4-BP at a molar ratio of approximately 1:1. The association and dissociation at pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl had rate constants of 1.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and 2 +/- 1 x 10(-3) s-1, respectively. Glycosylation and engineered amino acid substitutions of IL4-BP did not alter the kinetic constants as shown by a parallel analysis of IL4-BP variants produced in Escherichia coli or Chinese hamster ovary cells. The rate of association was only slightly affected in binding-deficient variants [E9Q]IL-4 and [R88Q]IL-4 and by acidic pH down to values of 4.5, but it was reduced up to fivefold at higher ionic strength. The rate of dissociation was increased 70-fold and 150-fold with the IL-4 variants and fivefold at an acidic pH of 4.5, but it was not affected by high ionic strength. Temperatures between 6 degrees C and 37 degrees C yielded similar rates of IL-4 dissociation and only a marginally reduced rate of IL-4 association at 6 degrees C. These results indicate that the high-affinity binding of IL-4 to its receptor (Kd approximately 100 pM) is mainly the result of an unusually high association rate. The IL-4/IL4-BP interaction appears to be dominated by charge effects. The exceedingly high rate of IL-4/IL4-BP association is augmented by the overall electrostatic potentials of both proteins (electrostatic steering). Localized charges and the formation of ion pairs may control the rate of complex dissociation.",

Truncations containing either the extracellular agonist binding domain plus transmembrane helix 1 (ECD/TMH1-GFP) or the transmembrane domain plus the intracellular carboxyl terminus (TMD/carboxyl terminus-GFP) were used to identify the dimerization domain. ECD/TMH1-GFP was a dimer in the absence of reducing reagents, whereas TMD/carboxyl-terminal GFP was a monomer in the absence or presence of reducing agents, suggesting that dimerization occurs via the ECD. To identify the residue(s) involved in dimerization within the ECD, cysteine --> serine point mutations were made in residues that are conserved between hCaR and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Mutations at positions 60 and 131 were expressed at levels comparable to wild type in HEK 293 cells, had minimal effects on hCaR function, and did not eliminate dimerization, whereas mutations at positions 101 and 236 greatly decreased receptor expression and resulted in significant amounts of monomer in the absence of reducing agents. The double point mutant hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was expressed more robustly than either C101S or C236S and covalent dimerization was eliminated. hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP had a decreased affinity for extracellular Ca2+ and slower response kinetics upon increases or decreases in agonist concentration.

A deeper understanding of the importance of the hydrophobic nature of sequence position 5, and the particular relevance of leucine at that location, was sought by examination of the properties of a series of mutant proteins containing A5, V5, I5, and W5 as replacements for L5 in recombinant (r)-PC and APC. The Ca(2+)- and PL-dependent plasma-based anticoagulant activities of [L5A]r-APC, [L5V]r-APC, [L5I]r-APC, and [L5W]r-APC were determined to be approximately 28%, 51%, 98%, and 105%, respectively, of that of wild-type r-APC. A similar trend in activities of the mutant enzymes was observed in in vitro factor V/Va and factor VIII/VIIIa inactivation assays. Apparently normal Ca(2+)-dependent conformations were adopted by each of the mutant proteins, but the Ca(2+)-bound form of [L5A]r-PC was relatively the most defective of the mutants in its binding to PL. These results confirm the importance of the hydrophobic character at sequence position 5 as critical to the functional binding of PC to PL.",

Smad4 has two important functional domains, MH1 and MH2, that are involved in different biological processes. The MH1 domain comprises a DNA binding domain and the MH2 domain is mainly implicated in transcriptional activation and homo- and heteromeric complex formation among Smad proteins. In the present study, a total of nine Smad4 mutations at both MH1 and MH2 domains were analysed and all of them had a reduced activity to stimulate transcription of a TGF-beta-responsive reporter gene. All four MH1 mutations had a markedly reduced ability to bind a consensus Smad binding element by an in vitro assay using GST fusion proteins. Among the MH2 mutations, R497H, K507Q, and R515G mutations of Smad4 gave rise to a reduced DNA binding capacity. The R497H mutation had a slightly reduced interaction with Smad2 upon activation of TGF-beta receptor. However, the K507Q and R515G mutations greatly lost their ability to associate with Smad2. Using a GST pull-down assay, it was found that the Smad4 MH2 domain bearing R497H and R515G mutations had an enhanced interaction with the MH1 region of the Smad4 protein, indicating that an increased intramolecular interaction by these mutations may alleviate the DNA binding activity at the MH1 domain. Consistent with these observations, the MH2 domain with R497H mutation had an enhanced ability to inhibit TGF-beta receptor-mediated transcription. In addition, the full-length R497H mutation was able to antagonize TGF-beta signaling in a dominant-negative manner. Therefore, these studies revealed novel mechanisms by which the Smad4 mutations utilize to abrogate their functions in transducing the signaling of TGF-beta, which plays an important role in various stages of cancer formation.",

To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we investigated an activity of MEK1 for MyoD. Activated MEK1 associates with MyoD in the nucleus of differentiating myoblasts. In vitro kinase assay using active MEK1, a (32)P-labeled protein band corresponding to GST-MyoD was observed but not to mutant GST-MyoD-Y156F. Tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous MyoD was detected with a specific anti-pMyoD-Y156 antibody; however, this response was blocked by PD184352, a MEK-specific inhibitor. These results indicate that activated MEK1 phosphorylates the MyoD-Y156 residue directly. Interestingly, the protein level of mutant MyoD-Y156F decreased compared with that of wild type but was recovered in the presence of lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor. The protein level of MyoD-Y156E, which mimics phosphorylation at Tyr-156, was above that of wild type, indicating that the phosphorylation protects MyoD from the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation. In addition, the low protein level of MyoD-Y156F was recovered over that of wild type by an additional mutation at Leu-164, a critical binding residue of MAFbx/AT-1, a Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) E3-ubiquitin ligase. The amount of MyoD co-precipitated with MAFbx/AT-1 also was reduced in the presence of active MEK1. Thus, these results suggested that the phosphorylation probably interrupts the binding of MAFbx/AT-1 to MyoD and thereby increases its stability. Collectively, our results suggest that MEK1 activated in differentiating myoblasts stimulates muscle differentiation by phosphorylating MyoD-Y156, which results in MyoD stabilization.",

EGFR-13, but not EGFR-14, increased autophosphorylation (by twofold) of the full-length and two truncated forms (Delta1022-1186 and a constitutively active receptor kinase domain) of the EGFR. EGFR-13 increased the stoichiometry of tyrosine phosphorylation of the full-length receptor from 4.2 to 10.1 mol Pi/mol EGFR and that of EGFRDelta1022-1186 from 1.0 to 2 mol Pi/mol receptor. Increased receptor autophosphorylation in the presence of EGFR-13 cannot solely be attributed to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity because EGFR-14 and polylysine increased tyrosine kinase activity of EGFRDelta1022-1186 and full-length EGFR, respectively, to the same extent as EGFR-13 without any effects on receptor autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of EGFR-13 (P-EGFR-13) on the threonine residue corresponding to Thr654 in EGFR obliterated the ability of the peptide to increase autophosphorylation and markedly diminished its capacity to increase receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Additionally, EGFR-13, but not EGFR-14 or P-EGFR-13, decreased the migration of the receptor on nondenaturing gels, indicating that EGFR-13 induces some conformational change. Phosphopeptide maps of the EGFR phosphorylated in the presence of EGFR-13 or pp60(c-src) demonstrated that the additional sites phosphorylated in the presence of EGFR-13 were the same as those phosphorylated by pp60(c-src) (i.e., Y803, Y845, Y891, Y920, and Y1101). Thus, we conclude that EGFR-13, but not EGFR-14 or P-EGFR-13, competes to disrupt interactions between amino acids 645-657 and some other region(s) on the EGFR to either alleviate a conformational constraint or alter dimer conformation. This change increases the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR and provides access to additional tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the receptor.",

Upon activation by a variety of cellular stresses, p53 transactivates downstream target genes, through which it regulates cell cycle and apoptosis. However, little is known about p53 in invertebrates. Here we report the identification and characterization of a Drosophila p53 homologue gene, dp53. dp53 encodes a 385-amino acid protein with significant homology to human p53 (hp53) in the region of the DNA-binding domain, and to a lesser extent the tetramerization domain. Purified dp53 DNA-binding domain protein was shown to bind to the consensus hp53-binding site by gel mobility analysis. In transient transfection assays, expression of dp53 in Schneider cells transcriptionally activated promoters that contained consensus hp53-responsive elements. Moreover, a mutant dp53 (Arg-155 to His-155), like its hp53 counterpart mutant, exerted a dominant-negative effect on transactivation. Ectopic expression of dp53 in Drosophila eye disk caused cell death and led to a rough eye phenotype. dp53 is expressed throughout the development of Drosophila with highest expression levels in early embryogenesis, which has a maternal component. Consistent with this, dp53 RNA levels were high in the nurse cells of the ovary. It appears that p53 is structurally and functionally conserved from flies to mammals. Drosophila will provide a useful genetic system to the further study of the p53 network.",

A putative cooperation between the GPIb alpha and GPIb beta cytoplasmic domains was investigated by measuring the adhesion under flow to immobilized VWF of K562 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with GPIb/(V)/IX containing mutations in this region. Adhesion of cells carrying a glycine substitution of the GPIb beta Ser166 phosphorylation site was 50% lower than normal and became insensitive to inhibition by RAM.1. In contrast, forskolin or PGE(1) treatment increased both the phosphorylation of GPIb beta and adhesion of control cells, both effects being reversed by RAM.1, but had no influence on cells expressing the Ser166Gly mutation. A role of the GPIb alpha intracellular domain was also apparent as the VWF-dependent adhesion of cells containing deletions of the entire (Delta 518-610) or portions (Delta 535-568, Delta 569-610) of the GPIb alpha cytoplasmic tail was insensitive to RAM.1 inhibition. Cells carrying progressive 11 amino acid deletions spanning the GPIb alpha 535-590 region were equally unresponsive to RAM.1, with the exception of those containing GPIb alpha Delta 569-579, which behaved like control cells. These findings support a role of the GPIb beta intracellular domain in controlling the adhesive properties of the GPIb/V/IX complex through phosphorylation of GPIb beta Ser166 and point to the existence of cross-talk between the GPIb beta and GPIb alpha intracellular domains.",

Inherited mutations in these proteins are associated with cancer predisposition of these patients. We recently discovered that cells from Werner syndrome patients displayed a deficiency in p53-mediated apoptosis and WRN binds to p53. Here, we report that analogous to WRN, BLM also binds to p53 in vivo and in vitro, and the C-terminal domain of p53 is responsible for the interaction. p53-mediated apoptosis is defective in BS fibroblasts and can be rescued by expression of the normal BLM gene. Moreover, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from BS donors are resistant to both gamma-radiation and doxorubicin-induced cell killing, and sensitivity can be restored by the stable expression of normal BLM. In contrast, BS cells have a normal Fas-mediated apoptosis, and in response to DNA damage normal accumulation of p53, normal induction of p53 responsive genes, and normal G(1)-S and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest. BLM localizes to nuclear foci referred to as PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients carrying p53 germline mutations and LCLs lacking a functional p53 have a decreased accumulation of BLM in NBs, whereas isogenic lines with functional p53 exhibit normal accumulation. Certain BLM mutants (C1055S or Delta133-237) that have a reduced ability to localize to the NBs when expressed in normal cells can impair the localization of wild type BLM to NBs and block p53-mediated apoptosis, suggesting a dominant-negative effect. Taken together, our results indicate both a novel mechanism of p53 function by which p53 mediates nuclear trafficking of BLM to NBs and the cooperation of p53 and BLM to induce apoptosis.",

A fragment encompassing the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and downstream sequence (GST-N) bound to G protein beta 1 gamma 2 in an in vitro binding assay, and binding was inhibited by G protein alpha subunit, G alpha i1. This PLC-beta 3 fragment also inhibited G beta gamma-stimulated PLC-beta activity in a reconstitution system, while having no significant effect on G alpha q-stimulated PLC-beta 3 activity. The N-terminal G beta gamma binding region was delineated further to the first 180 amino acids, and the sequence Asn150-Ser180, just distal to the PH domain, was found to be required for the interaction. Mutation of basic residues 154Arg, 155Lys, 159Lys, and 161Lys to Glu within this region reduced G beta gamma binding affinity and specifically reduced the EC50 for G beta gamma-dependent activation of the mutant enzyme 3-fold.

Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) occured 15 h after FGF1 addition. These events were Ras-dependent as they were blocked by a Ras dominant negative form. The Ras activity was promoted by three upstream effectors, growth factor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src cytoplasmic kinase. Ras activation was inhibited by a Grb2 dominant negative form (P49L), by PI3K inhibitors, including wortmannin, LY294002, the N-SH2 domain of p85alpha PI3K and by the SH2 domain of Src. Src activation induced by FGF1 was blocked by the SH2 domain of Src and PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src. The Grb2 adaptor was recruited by the upstream Src homology 2/alpha-collagen-related (Shc) effector, as the SH2-Shc domain prevented the GVBD and the ERK2 phosphorylation induced by FGF1. The importance of another signalling pathway involving phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) was also investigated. The use of the PLCgamma inhibitory peptide, neomycin and the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM on oocytes expressing FGFR1 or the stimulation by PDGF-BB of oocytes expressing PDGFR-FGFR1 mutated on the PLCgamma binding site, prevented GVBD and ERK2 phosphorylation. This study shows that the transduction cascade induced by the FGFR1-FGF1 interaction in Xenopus oocytes represents the sum of Ras-dependent and PLCgamma-dependent pathways. It emphasizes the role played by PI3K and Src and their connections with the Ras cascade in the FGFR1 signal transduction.",

AGR2 is in the protein-disulphide isomerase superfamily containing a single cysteine (Cys-81) that forms covalent adducts with its client proteins. We have found that mutation of Cysteine-81 attenuates its biochemical activity in its sequence-specific peptide docking function, reduces binding to Reptin, and reduces its stability in cells. As such, we evaluated how chemical oxidation of its cysteine affects its biochemical properties. Recombinant AGR2 spontaneously forms covalent dimers in the absence of reductant whilst DTT promotes dimer to monomer conversion. Mutation of Cysteine-81 to alanine prevents peroxide catalysed dimerization of AGR2 in vitro, suggesting a reactive cysteine is central to covalent dimer formation. Both biochemical assays and ESI mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate that low levels of a chemical oxidant promote an intermolecular disulphide bond through formation of a labile sulfenic acid intermediate. However, higher levels of oxidant promote sulfinic or sulfonic acid formation thus preventing covalent dimerization of AGR2. These data together identify the single cysteine of AGR2 as an oxidant responsive moiety that regulates its propensity for oxidation and its monomeric-dimeric state. This has implications for redox regulation of the pro-oncogenic functions of AGR2 protein in cancer cells. ",

Functional analysis of both RM platelets and CHO cells stably expressing this truncated integrin revealed that the alpha(IIb)beta3Arg724Ter complex is able to mediate binding to immobilized fibrinogen, though downstream events, including cytoskeletally-mediated cell spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK, fail to occur.

Our results indicate that P160 BCR is tyrosine phosphorylated at the same site by Bcr-Abl in kinase assays (Puil et al., 1994). We performed experiments to determine whether Bcr, which was tyrosine phosphorylated within cells by activated c-Abl, could also bind Grb2, and whether phosphotyrosine 177 was the major binding site. Complexes between Bcr and Abl were detected in a hemopoietic cell line lacking Bcr-Abl and in COS1 cells coexpressing both Bcr and Abl proteins. P160 BCR was tyrosine phosphorylated in COS1 cells coexpressing Abl and Bcr proteins. Similarly, various deletion mutants of Bcr including BCRN553, BCRN413 and BCRN221 were tyrosine phosphorylated by activated c-Abl whereas BCRN159 was not. Wild-type Bcr and Bcr Y177F were examined under these conditions for their ability to co-precipitate with Grb2. The results showed that while wild-type tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr efficiently bound Grb2, tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr Y177F had greatly reduced Grb2-binding ability. Studies with GST-SH2 (Grb2) revealed that tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr was able to bind to GST SH2 (Grb2) but tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr Y177F was deficient in binding. These results indicate that the Bcr protein when phosphorylated at tyrosine 177 binds Grb2, thereby implicating Bcr as a potantial activator of the Ras pathway.",

Among these are the focal adhesion proteins p130cas (Cas) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Here we identify the kinase(s) mediating integrin-induced Cas phosphorylation and characterize protein-protein interactions mediated by phosphorylated Cas. We found that expression of a constitutively active FAK in fibroblasts results in a consecutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. This effect required the autophosphorylation site of FAK, which is a binding site for Src family kinases. Integrin-mediated phosphorylation of Cas was not, however, compromised in fibroblasts lacking FAK. In contrast, adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was reduced in cells lacking Src, whereas enhanced phosphorylation of Cas was observed Csk- cells, in which Src kinases are activated. These results suggest that Src kinases are responsible for the integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. FAK seems not to be necessary for phosphorylation of Cas, but when autophosphorylated, FAK may recruit Src family kinases to phosphorylate Cas. Cas was found to form complexes with Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling molecules, such as the SH2/SH3 adapter protein Crk, following integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors C3G and Sos were found in the Cas-Crk complex upon integrin ligand binding.

Since SOS2, PKS8 and PKS11 have low enzymatic activities in vitro and their amino acid sequences are homologous to that of CIPK3, it was assumed that CIPK3 would have a low enzymatic activity. To enhance CIPK3 enzyme activity, a constitutively active form, CIPK3T183D, was generated by a Thr(183) to Asp(183) substitution in the activation loop. To obtain proteins for analysis, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein system was used. Although both CIPK3 and CIPK3T183D were successfully expressed, they were found in inclusion bodies with three truncated proteins. Since the truncated proteins had a similar affinity to the GST-Bind Resin as the target protein, the one-step affinity purification could no longer be used. As an alternative, His fusion protein expression system was employed for protein production. Although both His-CIPK3 and His-CIPK3T183D also accumulated in inclusion bodies, they were expressed as a single protein species. A method involving Sarkosyl was developed for isolating and purifying the His fusion proteins. His-CIPK3 and His-CIPK3T183D produced were highly purified and enzymatically active.

Mutations in p53 are rarely found in these diseases before acute leukemia transformation, but this does not rule out a role for p53 deregulation in disease progression. Using Ba/F3-EPOR cells and ex vivo cultured CD34(+) cells from MPN patients, we demonstrate that expression of JAK2(V617F) affected the p53 response to DNA damage. We show that E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 accumulated in these cells, due to an increased translation of MDM2 mRNA. Accumulation of the La autoantigen, which interacts with MDM2 mRNA and promotes its translation, was responsible for the increase in MDM2 protein level and the subsequent degradation of p53 after DNA damage. Downregulation of La protein or cell treatment with nutlin-3, a MDM2 antagonist, restored the p53 response to DNA damage and the cytokine-dependence of Ba/F3-EPOR-JAK2(V617F) cells. Altogether, these data indicate that the JAK2(V617F) mutation affects p53 response to DNA damage through the upregulation of La antigen and accumulation of MDM2. They also suggest that p53 functional inactivation accounts for the cytokine hypersensitivity of JAK2(V617F) MPN and might have a role in disease progression.",

We have identified different mutations in human CXCR4 that prevent efficient infection by one HIV-1 strain (NDK) but not another (LAI) and sought to define these strain-dependent effects at the gp120 level. The lack of activity toward the NDK strain of the HHRH chimeric CXCR4 in which the second extracellular loop (ECL2) derived from the rat CXCR4 and of CXCR4 with mutations at an aspartic acid in ECL2 (D193A and D193R) was apparently due to the sequence of the third variable loop (V3) of gp120, more precisely, to its C-terminal part. Indeed, substitution of the LAI V3 loop or only its C-terminal part in the NDK gp 120 context was sufficient to restore usage of the HHRH, D193A, and D193R receptors. The same result was achieved upon mutation of a single lysine residue of the NDK V3 loop to alanine (K319A) but not to arginine (K319R). These results provide a strong case for a direct interaction between the gp120 V3 loop and the ECL2 domain of CXCR4. By contrast, V3 substitutions had no effect on the inability of NDK to infect cells via a mutant CXCR4 in which the amino-terminal extracellular domain (NT) is deleted. In experiments with a set of chimeric NDK-LAI gp120s, the V1/V2 region from LAI gp120 was both necessary and sufficient for usage of the NT-deleted CXCR4. Different variable domains of gp120 can therefore cooperate for a functional interaction with CXCR4.",

The results of a binding assay using gluthathione S-transferase (GST) fusion alpha-synuclein protein and an immunoprecipitation assay revealed that wild-type or mutant (A30P and A53T) alpha-synuclein (approximately 16 kDa) does not bind to any of these members of the Bcl-2 family. Furthermore, no binding was observed between alpha-synuclein and BAD, regardless of the phosphorylation state of the serine residue in BAD. In contrast, alpha-synuclein was observed to bind to synphilin-1. Although alpha-synuclein has been reported to bind to BAD, modification of alpha-synuclein might be required for such binding to occur.",

The main focus of Raf regulation studies has been on phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and scaffolding proteins; however, Raf also has its own auto-regulatory domain. Removal of the N-terminal regulatory domain, initially discovered in the viral Raf oncogene (v-Raf), results in a kinase domain with high basal activity independent of Ras activation. In this report, we show that activating phosphorylations are still required for activity of the truncated C-terminal kinase domain (called 22W). The interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain is disrupted by activated Ras. Mutations in the Ras binding domain, cysteine-rich domain, or S259A do not affect the inhibition of 22W by the N-terminal domain. When phosphomimetic residues are substituted at the activating sites (DDED) in 22W, this results in a higher basal activity that is no longer inhibited by expression of the N-terminal domain, although binding to the N-terminal domain still occurs. Although the interaction between 22W/DDED and the N-terminal domain may be in a different conformation, the interaction is still disrupted by activated Ras. These data demonstrate that N-terminal domain binding to the kinase domain inhibits the activity of the kinase domain. However, this inhibition is relieved when the C-terminal kinase domain is activated by phosphorylation.",

At least three distinct protein-binding activities have been identified in RB: the large A/B pocket binds E2F, the A/B pocket binds the LXCXE peptide motif, and the C pocket binds the nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase. Substitution of Trp for Arg 661 in the B region of RB (mutant 661) inactivates both E2F and LXCXE binding. The tumor suppression function of mutant 661 is not abolished, because this allele predisposes its carriers to retinoblastoma development with a low penetrance. In cell-based assays, 661 is shown to inhibit G1/S progression. This low-penetrance mutant also induces terminal growth arrest with reduced but detectable activity. We have constructed mutations that disrupt C pocket activity. When overproduced, the RB C-terminal fragment did not induce terminal growth arrest but could inhibit G1/S progression, and this activity was abolished by the C-pocket mutations. In full-length RB, the C-pocket mutations reduced but did not abolish RB function. Interestingly, combination of the C-pocket and 661 mutations completely abolished RB's ability to cause an increase in the percentage of cells in G1 and to induce terminal growth arrest. These results suggest that the A/B or C region can induce a prolongation of G1 through mechanisms that are independent of each other. In contrast, long-term growth arrest requires combined activities from both regions of RB. In addition, E2F and LXCXE binding are not the only mechanisms through which RB inhibits cell growth. The C pocket also contributes to RB-mediated growth suppression.",

In contrast, GST fusions either of Ste7p (a MEK homologue) or the beta-subunit of the mating response G-protein and immunoprecipitated Ste5p were not phosphorylated by the Ste20p immune complexes. Myelin basic protein was identified as an excellent in vitro substrate, whereas histone H1 was only poorly phosphorylated. Evidence was obtained that autophosphorylation might play a regulatory role for the in vitro kinase activity. The in vitro activity was found to be Ca(2+)-independent. Both the in vivo and in vitro activities were abolished by mutational changes of either the conserved lysine residue 649 within the ATP binding site or threonine 777 between the catalytic subdomains VII and VIII. Wild-type Ste20p and the catalytically inactive T777A mutant were identified as phosphoproteins in vivo. The phosphorylation occurred at serine and threonine residues independent of pheromone stimulation.

Levels of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA and protein correlated with telomerase activity. ERK1/2 and Akt kinase (Akt) were activated by IL-2 stimulation. LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, abolished expression of hTERT mRNA and protein expression and abolished hTERT activity, whereas PD98059, which inhibits MEK1/2 and thus ERK1/2, had no effect. In addition, radicicol, an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), blocked IL-2-induced hTERT activity and nuclear translocation of hTERT but not hTERT mRNA expression. hTERT was coimmunoprecipitated with Akt, Hsp90, mTOR, and p70 S6 kinase (S6K), suggesting that these molecules form a physical complex. Immunoprecipitates of Akt, Hsp90, mTOR, and S6K from IL-2-stimulated NK-92 cells contained telomerase activity. Furthermore, the findings that Hsp90 and mTOR immunoprecipitates from primary samples contained telomerase activity are consistent with the results from NK-92 cells. These results indicate that IL-2 stimulation induces hTERT activation and that the mechanism of IL-2-induced hTERT activation involves transcriptional or posttranslational regulation through the pathway including PI3K/Akt, Hsp90, mTOR, and S6K in NK cells.",

Microinjection of dominant/negative p21ras(N17) completely inhibited EGF-induced DNA synthesis in both cell types. EGF stimulated Shc phosphorylation as well as the formation of wild type EGFR.Shc complexes. In contrast, EGF stimulated Shc phosphorylation without formation of Delta973-EGFR.Shc complexes. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc formed complexes with Grb2.Sos, and microinjection of anti-Shc antibody and Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein inhibited EGF stimulation of DNA synthesis in both cell lines. EGF markedly increased ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation in wild type EGFR cells. In Delta973-EGFR cells, ErbB2 was tyrosine phosphorylated in the basal state and EGFR stimulated further phosphorylation of ErbB2. In addition to ErbB2, additional proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated in Delta973-EGFR cells, mostly in the molecular mass range of 120 170 kDa. Taken together with our findings indicating coupling of ErbB2 to Shc, these data suggest the importance of an alternative signaling pathway in Delta973-EGFR cells mediated by the formation of heterodimeric structures between the truncated EGFR and ErbB2, followed by coupling through Shc to Grb2.Sos and the p21ras pathway, ultimately leading to mitogenesis.",

We now show that stress signals initiated by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) induce G(1) arrest through protein stabilization of the CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1). TGF-beta 1 was previously shown to increase p21 protein levels, which in turn mediated G(1) arrest through inactivation of the CDK2-cyclin E complex in HD3 cells (Yan, Z., Kim, G.-Y., Deng, X., and Friedman, E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9870-9879). We now demonstrate that the increase in p21 abundance is caused by a post-transcriptional, SMAD-independent mechanism. TGF-beta1 activated p38 alpha and JNK1, which initiated the phosphorylation of p21. TGF-beta1 treatment increased the half-life of p21 by 3-4-fold. The increase in p21 stability was detected following activation of p38 alpha and JNK1, and treatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 prevented this increase in p21 stability. p38 alpha and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 in vivo, and both p38 alpha and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 at Ser(130) in vitro. Peptide mapping demonstrated that both TGF-beta 1 and p38 alpha induced phosphorylation of p21 at Ser(130) in vivo, and mutation of Ser(130) to alanine rendered p21 less stable than wild-type p21. TGF-beta 1 increased the stability of wild-type p21, but not the p21-S130A mutant.

As these unique drug resistance mutations can compromise the fitness of the virus to replicate, mutations that restore conformational stability and activity while retaining drug resistance are selected on further evolution. Here we identify several compensating mechanisms by which an extreme drug-resistant mutant bearing 20 mutations (PR20) with >5-fold increased Kd and >4000-fold decreased affinity to the PI darunavir functions. (1) PR20 cleaves, albeit poorly, Gag polyprotein substrates essential for viral maturation. (2) PR20 dimer, which exhibits distinctly enhanced thermal stability, has highly attenuated autoproteolysis, thus likely prolonging its lifetime in vivo. (3) The enhanced stability of PR20 results from stabilization of the monomer fold. Both monomeric PR20(T26A) and dimeric PR20 exhibit Tm values 6-7.5 \u00b0C higher than those for their PR counterparts. Two specific mutations in PR20, L33F and L63P at sites of autoproteolysis, increase the Tm of monomeric PR(T26A) by ~8 \u00b0C, similar to PR20(T26A). However, without other compensatory mutations as seen in PR20, L33F and L63P substitutions, together, neither restrict autoproteolysis nor significantly reduce binding affinity to darunavir. To determine whether dimer stability contributes to binding affinity for inhibitors, we examined single-chain dimers of PR and PR(D25N) in which the corresponding identical monomer units were covalently linked by GGSSG sequence. Linking of the subunits did not appreciably change the \u0394Tm on inhibitor binding; thus stabilization by tethering appears to have little direct effect on enhancing inhibitor affinity.",

Here we show that in vitro RK phosphorylates human GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 at Thr25 in the proline-rich N-terminal region Thr222 and Ser272 in the catalytic domain and Thr334 in the C-terminal domain. Using novel methodology we demonstrate that activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 requires the phosphorylation of any two of the three residues Thr222, Ser272 and Thr334. Ser9, Thr25, Thr222, Ser272, Thr334 and Thr338 became 32P-labelled in stressed KB cells and labelling was prevented by the specific RK inhibitor SB 203580, establishing that RK phosphorylates Thr25, Thr222, Ser272 and Thr334 in vivo. The 32P-labelling of Thr338 is likely to result from autophosphorylation. GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 lacking the N-terminal domain was inactive, but activated fully when phosphorylated at Thr222, Ser272 and Thr334 by p42 MAPK or RK. In contrast, full-length GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 was phosphorylated at Thr25 (and not activated) by p42 MAPK, suggesting a role for the N-terminal domain in specifying activation by RK in vivo. The mutant Asp222/Asp334 was 20% as active as phosphorylated MAPKAP kinase-2, and this constitutively active form may be useful for studying its physiological roles.",

The binding of CSBP to MAPKAP kinase-3 was confirmed in vitro by the precipitation of epitope-tagged CSBP1, CSBP2, and CSBP2(D168A) and endogenous CSBP from mammalian cells by a bacterially expressed GST-MAPKAP kinase-3 fusion protein and in vivo by co-precipitation of the epitope-tagged proteins co-expressed in HeLa cells. MAPKAP kinase-3 was phosphorylated by both CSBP1 and CSBP2 and was then able to phosphorylate HSP27 in vitro. Treatment of HeLa cells with sorbitol or TNF resulted in activation of CSBP and MAPKAP kinase-3 and activation of MAPKAP kinase-3 could be blocked by preincubation of cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of CSBP kinase activity.

However, the molecular mechanism of maspin remains illusive, primarily because its molecular targets are unknown. To this end, we used a full-length maspin cDNA bait to screen against both a primary prostate tumor cDNA prey library and a HeLa cDNA prey library by the yeast two-hybrid method. We found that heat shock protein 90, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and heat shock protein 70 interacted with maspin with the highest frequencies. We confirmed the maspin/GST interaction using purified proteins, human epithelial cell lines, and human prostate tissues. A maspin variant that has a point mutation of Arg(340) to Ala (Mas(R340A)) showed a significantly decreased affinity for GST. Although purified maspin had no effect on the activity of purified GST in vitro, intracellular interaction between endogenous maspin and GST correlated with an elevated total GST activity in both MDA-MB-435- and DU145-derived stably transfected cells. Consistently, tumor cells treated with purified wild type maspin, but not Mas(R340A), enhanced cellular GST activity. Maspin expression in cancer cell lines also correlated with decreased basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, H(2)O(2) treatment not only induced GST expression but also increased intracellular maspin/GST interaction, which was inversely correlated with the level of ROS generation. Conversely, maspin knockdown by small interfering RNA increased the basal, as well as H(2)O(2)-induced, ROS generation. Furthermore, the maspin effect on ROS generation was completely abolished by a GST inhibitor, indicating an essential role of GST in maspin-mediated cellular response to oxidative stress. Consistently, oxidative stress-induced vascular endothelial growth factor A expression was significantly inhibited in maspin-expressing cells. Together, our data suggest a new mechanism by which maspin, through its direct interaction with GST, may inhibit oxidative stress-induced ROS generation and vascular endothelial growth factor A induction, thus preventing further adverse effects on tumor genetics and stromal reactivity.",

In this study, we generated several Ang1 and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) variants to define the role of the superclustering and oligomerization domains of the Ang1 protein. Then we analyzed the molecular structure of the variants with SDS-PAGE and rotary metal-shadowing transmission electron microscopy (RMSTEM) and determined the effects of these variants on the binding and activation of Tie2. Ang1 exists as heterogeneous multimers with basic trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric oligomers, whereas Ang2 exists as trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric oligomers. The variant Ang1C265S, consisting of trimers, tetramers, and pentamers without multimeric forms of Ang1, yielded less Tie2 activation than did Ang1, whereas monomeric Ang1 (Ang1/FD), dimeric Ang1 variants (Ang1D2, and Ang1D3), and dimeric and trimeric Ang1 variant (Ang1D1) dramatically lost their ability to bind and activate Tie2. An Ang1 protein in which two cysteines (amino acids 41 and 54) were replaced with serines (Ang1C41S/C54S) formed mostly dimers and trimers that were not able to bind and activate Tie2. In addition, improper creation of a new cysteine in Ang2 (Ang2S263C) dramatically induced Ang2 aggregation without activating Tie2. In conclusion, proper oligomerization of Ang1 having at least four subunits by the intermolecular disulfide linkage involving cysteines 41 and 54 is critical for Tie2 binding and activation. Thus, our data shed a light on the structure-function relationships of Ang1 with Tie2.",

We screened expression libraries by Far Western blotting, using CRK SH3 as a probe, and identified partial cDNA sequences of four distinct proteins, including C3G, DOCK180, EPS15, and clone ST12. The consensus sequence of the CRK SH3 binding sites as deduced from their amino acid sequences was Pro+3-Pro+2-X+1-Leu0-Pro-1-X-2-Lys-3. The interaction of the CRK SH3 domain with the DOCK180 peptide was examined with an optical biosensor, based on the principles of surface plasmon resonance. A low dissociation constant of the order of 10(-7) resulted from a high association rate constant (kassoc = 3 x 10(4)) and low dissociation rate constant (kdiss = 3 x 10(-3)). All CRK-binding proteins except clone ST12 also bound to another adaptor protein, Grb2. Mutational analysis revealed that glycine at position +1 of ST12 inhibited the binding to Grb2 while retaining the high affinity binding to CRK SH3. The result suggests that the amino acid at position +1 also contributes to the high affinity binding of the peptides to the SH3 domain of Grb2, but not to that of CRK.",

This mutation segregated with aortic disease in these families with a combined two-point LOD score of 7.88. The majority of affected individuals presented with acute aortic dissections (63%) at relatively young ages (mean 31 years, range 17-51 years). PRKG1 encodes type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG-1), which is activated upon binding of cGMP and controls SMC relaxation. Although the p.Arg177Gln alteration disrupts binding to the high-affinity cGMP binding site within the regulatory domain, the altered PKG-1 is constitutively active even in the absence of cGMP. The increased PKG-1 activity leads to decreased phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain in fibroblasts and is predicted to cause decreased contraction of vascular SMCs. Thus, identification of a gain-of-function mutation in PRKG1 as a cause of thoracic aortic disease provides further evidence that proper SMC contractile function is critical for maintaining the integrity of the thoracic aorta throughout a lifetime.

Here we show that the human intracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin), protease inhibitor 9 (PI9), inhibits TNF-, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand- and Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis in certain TNF-sensitive cell lines. The reactive center P1 residue of PI9 was required for this inhibition since PI9 harboring a Glu --> Ala mutation in its reactive center failed to impair death receptor-induced cell death. This suggests a classical serpin-protease interaction. Indeed, PI9 inhibited apoptotic death by directly interacting with the intermediate active forms of caspase-8 and -10.

However, how CtIP executes this function remains to be elucidated. Here we show that in NIH 3T3 cells the expression of CtIP is regulated by the E2F/RB pathway during late G(1) and S phases. The presence of wild-type CtIP, but not the E157K mutant form, which failed to interact with RB, enhanced its own promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the recruitment of CtIP to its promoter occurs concomitantly with TFIIB, a component of the RNA polymerase II complex, and with dissociation of RB from the promoter during late G(1) and G(1)/S transition. Similar positive regulation of cyclin D1 expression by CtIP was also observed. Consistently, cells expressing the CtIP(E157K) protein alone exhibited growth retardation, an increase in the G(1) population, and a decrease in the S-phase population. Taken together, these results suggest that, contrary to the postulated universal corepressor role, CtIP activates a subset of E2F-responsive promoters by releasing RB-imposed repression and therefore promotes G(1)/S progression.",

The average of the pairwise root-mean-square deviations of the individual NMR conformers relative to the mean coordinates is 0.50 A for the backbone atoms N, C alpha and C' of residues 8 to 53.

Comparisons with the structure of the mutant Antennapedia homeodomain with Cys39 replaced by Ser, Antp (C39S), shows that the two proteins contain the same molecular fold for residues 8 to 53, whereas the more flexible fourth helix comprising residues 53 to 59 in the Antp (C39S) homeodomain has no counterpart in the ftz homeodomain. Considering that important intermolecular interactions in the DNA complexes with the Antp, engrailed and Mat alpha 2 homeodomains involve the fourth helix, it was rather unexpected that the stability of the complex of ftz with the BS2 operator site was found to be comparable to or even somewhat higher than that of the Antp complex with BS2.

Several basic amino acid residues interact with the triphosphate moiety of the substrate. The structure of the His112Ser mutant in complex with an undefined mixture of nucleotides determined at a resolution of 2.1A afforded additional details of the peptide folding.

E42A and D88N Hsp90\u03b2 variants bind but do not hydrolyze ATP, whereas E42A has increased and D88N decreased ATP affinity, compared with WT Hsp90\u03b2. Nevertheless, both of these mutants interact with WT p53 with a similar affinity. Surprisingly, in the case of WT, but also E42A Hsp90\u03b2, the presence of ATP stimulates dissociation of Hsp90-p53 complexes and results in p53 binding to the promoter sequence. D88N Hsp90\u03b2 is not efficient in both of these reactions. Using a trap version of the chaperonin GroEL, which irreversibly captures unfolded proteins, we show that Hsp90 chaperone action on WT p53 results in a partial unfolding of the substrate. The ATP-dependent dissociation of p53-Hsp90 complex allows further folding of p53 protein to an active conformation, able to bind to the promoter sequence. Furthermore, in support of these results, the overproduction of WT or E42A Hsp90\u03b2 stimulates transcription from the WAF1 gene promoter in H1299 cells. Altogether, our research indicates that ATP binding to Hsp90\u03b2 is a sufficient step for effective WT p53 client protein chaperoning.",

HSCR is a congenital complex genetic disorder characterised by a lack of enteric ganglia along a variable length of the intestine. The receptor tyrosine kinase gene (RET) is the major HSCR gene and its expression is crucial for ENS development. We have previously reported that (i) HOXB5 transcription factor mediates RET expression, and (ii) mouse with defective HOXB5 activity develop HSCR phenotype. In this study, we (i) elucidate the underlying mechanisms that HOXB5 mediate RET expression, and (ii) examine the interactions between HOXB5 and other transcription factors implicated in RET expression. We show that human HOXB5 binds to the promoter region 5' upstream of the binding site of NKX2-1 and regulates RET expression. HOXB5 and NKX2-1 form a protein complex and mediate RET expression in a synergistic manner. HSCR associated SNPs at the NKX2-1 binding site (-5G>A rs10900296; -1A>C rs10900297), which reduce NKX2-1 binding, abolish the synergistic trans-activation of RET by HOXB5 and NKX2-1. In contrast to the synergistic activation of RET with NKX2-1, HOXB5 cooperates in an additive manner with SOX10, PAX3 and PHOX2B in trans-activation of RET promoter. Taken together, our data suggests that HOXB5 in coordination with other transcription factors mediates RET expression. Therefore, defects in cis- or trans-regulation of RET by HOXB5 could lead to reduction of RET expression and contribute to the manifestation of the HSCR phenotype.",

GpIb/IX/V also functions to stimulate transmembranous signaling, leading to platelet activation and the expression of a ligand-receptive GpIIb-IIIa complex. The highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of GpIbalpha binds directly to a dimeric 14-3-3 adapter protein zeta isoform. To explore structural determinants of GpIb/IX/V binding to 14-3-3zeta, the authors examined 14-3-3zeta interactions with GpIbalpha and GpIbbeta in heterologous cells and platelets. Truncations of GpIbalpha at amino acid 542 or 594, or deletions of residues 542 through 590, inhibited binding of 14-3-3zeta. Deletion of GpIbalpha from Trp(570) to Ser(590) eliminated 14-3-3zeta binding, and deletion of the sequence from Arg(542)-Trp(570) enhanced binding of 14-3-3zeta to GpIbalpha. All GpIbalpha mutations that eliminated GpIbalpha binding to the GST-14-3-3zeta fusion protein also eliminated GpIbbeta binding to the fusion protein. Forskolin treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type GpIbalpha/beta/IX resulted in the phosphorylation of GpIbbeta associated with enhanced binding of GpIbbeta to GST-14-3-3zeta fusion protein and increased 14-3-3zeta coimmunoprecipitated with GpIbalpha. When intact human platelets aggregated in response to 90 dynes/cm(2) shear stress, 14-3-3zeta disassociated from GpIbalpha. Prostacyclin treatment of platelets inhibited shear stress-induced aggregation and the release of 14-3-3zeta from GpIbalpha. These data demonstrate that amino acid residues in the cytoskeletal interaction domains of GpIbalpha regulate 14-3-3zeta binding to GpIbalpha/beta/IX, and suggest that protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of GpIbbeta enhances 14-3-3zeta binding to the GpIb/IX/V complex in human platelets.

One cis element that drives polyadenylation is the CPE, which is bound by the protein CPEB. Polyadenylation is stimulated by Aurora A (Eg2)-catalyzed CPEB serine 174 phosphorylation, which occurs soon after oocytes are exposed to progesterone. Here, we show that insulin also stimulates Aurora A-catalyzed CPEB S174 phosphorylation, cytoplasmic polyadenylation, translation, and oocyte maturation. However, these insulin-induced events are uniquely controlled by PI3 kinase and PKC-zeta, which act upstream of Aurora A. The intersection of the progesterone and insulin signaling pathways occurs at glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), which regulates the activity of Aurora A. GSK-3 and Aurora A interact in vivo, and overexpressed GSK-3 inhibits Aurora A-catalyzed CPEB phosphorylation. In vitro, GSK-3 phosphorylates Aurora A on S290/291, the result of which is an autophosphorylation of serine 349. GSK-3 phosphorylated Aurora A, or Aurora A proteins with S290/291D or S349D mutations, have reduced or no capacity to phosphorylate CPEB. Conversely, Aurora A proteins with S290/291A or S349A mutations are constitutively active. These results suggest that the progesterone and insulin stimulate maturation by inhibiting GSK-3, which allows Aurora A activation and CPEB-mediated translation.",

In the present study performed in HEK-293 cells, we demonstrated that different topological domains of PTHR are implicated in agonist-dependent receptor internalization; truncation of the cytoplasmic tail (PTHR-TR), selective mutations of the cytoplasmic tail to remove the sites of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-stimulated phosphorylation (PTHR-PD), and mutations in the third transmembrane helix (N289A) or in the third cytoplasmic loop (K382A) resulted in a 30-60% reduction in (125)I-PTH-related protein internalization. To better define the role of these internalization determinants, we have tested the ability of these mutant PTHRs to associate with beta-arrestins by using three different methodological approaches: 1) ability of overexpression of beta-arrestins to restore the internalization of (125)I-PTH-related protein for the mutant PTHRs; 2) visualization of PTH-mediated trafficking of beta-arrestin1 and -2 fused to the green fluorescent protein with receptors by confocal microscopy; 3) quantification of beta-arrestin1-green fluorescent protein translocation by Western blot. Our data reveal that the receptor' cytoplasmic tail contains determinants of beta-arrestin interaction that are distinct from the phosphorylation sites and are sufficient for transient association of beta-arrestin2, but stable association requires receptor phosphorylation. Determinants in the receptor's core (Asn-289 and Lys-382) appear to regulate internalization of the receptor/beta-arrestin complex toward early endocytic endosomes during the initial step of endocytosis.",

Here, we show that phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 on EGFR is required for proliferation and transformation using several cell models of breast cancer. Overexpression of EGFR-Y845F or treating cells with the SFK inhibitor dasatinib abrogated tyrosine 845 phosphorylation, yet had little to no effect on other EGFR phosphorylation sites or EGFR kinase activity. Abrogation of Y845 phosphorylation inhibited cell proliferation and transformation, even though extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt remained active under these conditions. Importantly, cotransfection of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 3 and p38 MAPK restored cell proliferation in the absence of EGFR tyrosine 845 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel role for p38 MAPK signaling downstream of EGFR tyrosine 845 phosphorylation in the regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and transformation and implicate SFK inhibitors as a potential therapeutic mechanism for overcoming EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in breast cancer.",

Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) that are coupled to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation and the release of intracellular Ca(2+) stores play an important role in regulating neuronal function. We show here that mGluRs interact with the Htt-binding protein optineurin that is also linked to normal pressure open angled glaucoma and, when expressed in HEK 293 cells, optineurin functions to antagonize agonist-stimulated mGluR1a signaling. We find that Htt is co-precipitated with mGluR1a and that mutant Htt functions to facilitate optineurin-mediated attenuation of mGluR1a signaling. In striatal cell lines derived from Htt(Q111/Q111) mutant knock-in mice mGluR5-stimulated inositol phosphate formation is also severely impaired when compared with striatal cells derived from Htt(Q7/Q7) knock-in mice. In addition, we show that a missense single nucleotide polymorphism optineurin H486R variant previously identified to be associated with glaucoma is selectively impaired in mutant Htt binding. Although optineurin H486R retains the capacity to bind to mGluR1a, optineurin H486R-dependent attenuation of mGluR1a signaling is not enhanced by the expression of mutant Htt. Because G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) protein expression is relatively low in striatal tissue, we propose that optineurin may substitute for GRK2 in the striatum to mediate mGluR desensitization. Taken together, these studies identify a novel mechanism for mGluR desensitization and an additional biochemical link between altered glutamate receptor signaling and Huntington disease.",

Immortalized human WRN(-/-) WS fibroblasts, lacking a functional wrn gene, are impaired for basal and Tat-activated HIV-1 transcription. Overexpression of wild-type WRN transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in the absence of Tat, and WRN cooperates with Tat to promote high-level LTR transactivation. Ectopic WRN induces HIV-1 p24(Gag) production and retroviral replication in HIV-1-infected H9(HIV-1IIIB) lymphocytes. A dominant-negative helicase-minus mutant, WRN(K577M), inhibits LTR transactivation and HIV-1 replication. Inhibition of endogenous WRN, through co-expression of WRN(K577M), diminishes recruitment of p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF) and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to Tat/transactivation response-RNA complexes, and immortalized WRN(-/-) WS fibroblasts exhibit comparable defects in recruitment of PCAF and P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR.

DDR1 also has a major splice form, which has a 37 amino acid insert in the JM region with a consensus Shc PTB site that is lacking in the shorter receptor. One class of ligands for the DDR receptors has recently been identified as being derived from the collagen family, but neither native PC12 cells, which express modest amounts of DDR1, nor transfected PC12 cells, which express much larger amounts of DDR1, respond to this ligand. A chimeric receptor, containing the extracellular domain of hPDGFRbeta fused to the transmembrane and intracellular regions of DDR1, also fails to mediate neuronal-like differentiation in stably transfected PC12 cells and is only weakly autophosphorylated. However, chimeric receptors, which are composed of combinations of intracellular regions from DDR1 and TrkA (with the extracellular domain of hPDGFRbeta), in some cases provided ligand (PDGF) -inducible receptor responses. Those with the TrkA kinase domain and the DDR1 JM regions were able to produce differentiation to varying degrees, whereas the opposite combination did not. Analysis of the signaling responses of the two chimeras with DDR1 JM sequences (with and without the insert) indicated that the shorter sequence bound and activated FRS2 whereas the insert-containing form activated Shc instead. Both activated PLCgamma through the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of the TrkA domain (Y785 in TrkA residue numbering). Mutation of this site (Y-->F) eliminated PLCgamma activation (indicating there are no other cryptic binding sites for PLCgamma in the DDR1 sequences) and markedly reduced the differentiative activity of the receptor. This is in contrast to TrkA (or PDGFRbeta/TrkA chimeras), where ablation of this pathway has no notable effect on PC12 cell morphogenic responses. Thus, the activation of FRS2 and Shc (leading to MAPK activation) is weaker in the DDR1/TrkA chimeras than in TrkA alone, and the PLCgamma contribution becomes essential for full response. Nonetheless, both DDR1 JM regions contain potentially usable signaling sites, albeit they apparently are not activated directly in DDR1 (or DDR1 chimeras) in a ligand-dependent fashion. These findings suggest that the DDR1 receptors do have signaling capacity but may require additional components or altered conditions to fully activate their kinase domains and/or sustain the activation of the JM sites.",

Overexpression of cyclins promotes cell proliferation and cancer. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which cyclins regulate the expression of cell cycle promoting genes including subsequent cyclins. LIN-9 and the pocket proteins p107 and p130 are members of the DREAM complex that in G0 represses cell cycle genes. Interestingly, little is know about the regulation and function of LIN-9 after phosphorylation of p107,p130 by Cyclin D/Cdk4 disassembles the DREAM complex in early G1. In this report, we demonstrate that cyclin E1/Cdk3 phosphorylates LIN-9 on Thr-96. Mutating Thr-96 to alanine inhibits activation of cyclins A2 and B1 promoters, whereas a phosphomimetic Asp mutant strongly activates their promoters and triggers accelerated entry into G2/M phase in 293T cells. Taken together, our data suggest a novel role for cyclin E1 beyond G1/S and into S/G2 phase, most likely by inducing the expression of subsequent cyclins A2 and B1 through LIN-9.",

We have recently shown that the SH2 containing tyrosine phosphatase, Syp, binds directly to both the tyrosine phosphorylated form of the Epo receptor (EpoR) and to Grb2 after Epo stimulation of M07e cells engineered to express high levels of human EpoRs (T. Tauchi, et al: J Biol Chem 270:5631, 1995). To determine which tyrosine within the EpoR is responsible for binding Syp, we examined DA-3 cell lines expressing full-length mutant EpoRs bearing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions for each of the eight tyrosines within the intracellular domain of the EpoR. We found that: (1) all Epo-stimulated mutant EpoRs, except for the Y425F EpoR, coimmunoprecipitated with Syp; (2) all Epo-stimulated mutant EpoRs, except for the Y425F EpoR, bound to a GST-fusion protein containing both SH2 domains of Syp; (3) Jak2 could phosphorylate GST-Syp in vitro after Epo stimulation of wild-type (wt) EpoR expressing DA-3 cells; (4) Epo-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Syp in vivo was markedly reduced in Y425F EpoR expressing DA-3 calls; and (5) DA-3 cells expressing the Y425F EpoR grow less well in response to Epo than wt EpoR expressing cells. These results suggest that Syp binds via its SH2 domains to phosphorylated Y425 within the EpoR and is then phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by Jak2. Moreover, Y425 in the EpoR reduces the Epo requirement for Syp tyrosine phosphorylation and promotes proliferation.",

The overall time-dependent activation of EGFR autophosphorylation was identical in cells treated with 1 nm BTC or 1.5 nm EGF. Analysis of site-specific EGFR phosphorylation demonstrated that the BTC and EGF tyrosine phosphorylation of Y1086 was not significantly different. In contrast, the autophosphorylation of Y1173 was markedly reduced in BTC-stimulated cells, compared with EGF stimulation that directly correlated with a reduced BTC stimulation of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, Ras, and Raf-1 activation. On the other hand, Y1068 phosphorylation was significantly increased after BTC stimulation, compared with EGF in parallel with a greater extent of Erk phosphorylation. Expression of a dominant interfering MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) and Y1068F EGFR more efficiently blocked the enhanced Erk activation by BTC, compared with EGF. Interestingly BTC had a greater inhibitory effect on apoptosis, compared with EGF, and expression of Y1068F EGFR abolished this enhanced inhibitory effect. Together, these data indicated that although BTC and EGF share overlapping signaling properties, the ability of BTC to enhance Erk activation occurs independent of Ras. The increased BTC activation results from a greater extent of Y1068 EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent increased recruitment of the Grb2-MEKK1 complex to the plasma membrane, compared with EGF stimulation.

Kinetic analysis of the enzyme reveals that AnsA is positively cooperative, displaying a sigmoidal substrate dependence curve with an [S](0.5) of 1 mM L-asparagine and a Hill coefficient (n(H)) of 2.6. Binding of L-asparagine to an allosteric site was observed in the crystal structure concomitant with a reorganization of the quarternary structure, relative to the apo enzyme. The carboxyl group of the bound asparagine makes salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to Arg240, while the N(delta2) nitrogen interacts with Thr162. Mutation of Arg240 to Ala increases the [S](0.5) value to 5.9 mM, presumably by reducing the affinity of the site for L-asparagine, although the enzyme retains cooperativity. Mutation of Thr162 to Ala results in an active enzyme with no cooperativity. Transmission of the signal from the allosteric site to the active site appears to involve subtle interactions at the dimer-dimer interface and relocation of Gln118 into the vicinity of the active site to position the probable catalytic water molecule. These data define the structural basis for the cooperative regulation of the intracellular asparaginase that is required for proper functioning within the cell.",

CaMKII binds to GluN2B around S1303, the major CaMKII phosphorylation site on GluN2B. We show here that a phospho-mimetic S1303D mutation inhibited CaM-induced CaMKII binding to GluN2B in vitro, presenting a conundrum how binding can occur within cells, where high ATP concentration should promote S1303 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, addition of ATP actually enhanced the binding. Mutational analysis revealed that this positive net effect was caused by four modulatory effects of ATP, two positive (direct nucleotide binding and CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation) and two negative (GluN2B S1303 phosphorylation and CaMKII T305/6 autophosphorylation). Imaging showed positive regulation by nucleotide binding also within transfected HEK cells and neurons. In fact, nucleotide binding was a requirement for efficient CaMKII interaction with GluN2B in cells, while T286 autophosphorylation was not. Kinetic considerations support a model in which positive regulation by nucleotide binding and T286 autophosphorylation occurs faster than negative modulation by GluN2B S1303 and CaMKII T305/6 phosphorylation, allowing efficient CaMKII binding to GluN2B despite the inhibitory effects of the two slower reactions.",

NPM/ALK encodes a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that belongs to the family of tyrosine kinases activated by chromosomal translocations. Our studies showed that NPM/ALK, similar to other members of this family, activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector, serine/threonine kinase (Akt). PI3K was found in complex with NPM/ALK. Both PI3K and Akt kinase were permanently activated in NPM/ALK-transfected BaF3 murine hematopoietic cells and in NPM/ALK-positive, but not in NPM/ALK-negative, patient-derived anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell lines. In addition, Akt was phosphorylated/activated in protein samples isolated from four patients diagnosed with ALK-positive T/null-cell lymphomas. The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 induced apoptosis in NPM/ALK+ cells but exerted only minor effects on the control BaF3 parental cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by growth factors. Furthermore, retroviral infection of NPM/ALK+ BaF3 cells with a dominant-negative PI3K mutant (delta p85) or a dominant-negative Akt mutant (K179M) inhibited proliferation and clonogenic properties of the infected cells. Finally, the Akt mutant (K179M) suppressed the tumorigenicity of NPM/ALK-transfected BaF3 cells injected into syngeneic mice. In conclusion, our data indicate that NPM/ALK constitutively activates the PI3K-Akt pathway and that this pathway plays an important role in the NPM/ALK-mediated malignant transformation.",

          "text": "PURPOSE: Neural retina leucine-zipper (NRL), a member of the basic motif leucine zipper family of transcription factors, is preferentially expressed in rod photoreceptors of the mammalian retina. Mutations in NRL are associated with retinopathies; many of these are suggested to change phosphorylation status and alter NRL-mediated transactivation of rhodopsin promoter. The purpose of this study was to identify potential kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of NRL and determine if such kinase-dependent phosphorylation is altered in disease-associated NRL mutations. METHODS: Metabolic labeling with 33P-orthophosphate was used to study phosphorylation of NRL in transfected COS-1 cells. NRL or NRL mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins and used as substrate to screen various kinases by in vitro phosphorylation assays. CV-1 cells were co-transfected with rhodopsin promoter-reporter construct and expression plasmids, with or without specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, to examine their effect on NRL-mediated transactivation. Expression of activated MAPKs in postnatal mice retina was determined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: Metabolic labeling of NRL produces multiple phosphorylated protein bands in transfected COS-1 cells. Fewer but more intense radiolabeled bands are observed for NRL-S50T, -S50A, and -P51L mutants compared to wild-type NRL. We show that MAPK2 and p38 induce specific phosphorylation of NRL, but this pattern is altered in NRL mutants. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from developing mouse retina reveals enhanced expression of activated MAPK2 at postnatal day 0-3, concordant with the reported phosphorylation pattern of NRL in vivo. Inhibition of MAPK signaling pathways decreases NRL and CRX-mediated synergistic activation of rhodopsin promoter in transfected CV-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that multiple MAPKs can phosphorylate NRL and this phosphorylation pattern is altered by disease-associated NRL mutations. As inhibition of MAPK signaling pathways decreases NRL-mediated transactivation of rhodopsin promoter, we propose that phosphorylation changes associated with NRL mutations perturb gene expression in rods, leading to photoreceptor degeneration in retinopathies.",

Herein, using various biophysical methods, we show that while the WW1 domain of WWOX binds to PPXY motifs located within the ICD of ErbB4 in a physiologically relevant manner, the WW2 domain does not. Importantly, while the WW1 domain absolutely requires the integrity of the PPXY consensus sequence, nonconsensus residues within and flanking this motif do not appear to be critical for binding. This strongly suggests that the WW1 domain of WWOX is rather promiscuous toward its cellular partners. We also provide evidence that the lack of binding of the WW2 domain of WWOX to PPXY motifs is due to the replacement of a signature tryptophan, lining the hydrophobic ligand binding groove, with tyrosine (Y85). Consistent with this notion, the Y85W substitution within the WW2 domain exquisitely restores its binding to PPXY motifs in a manner akin to the binding of the WW1 domain of WWOX. Of particular significance is the observation that the WW2 domain augments the binding of the WW1 domain to ErbB4, implying that the former serves as a chaperone within the context of the WW1-WW2 tandem module of WWOX in agreement with our findings reported previously. Altogether, our study sheds new light on the molecular basis of an important WW-ligand interaction involved in mediating a plethora of cellular processes.",

          "text": "PURPOSE: To determine the effects of protein kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma) on phosphorylation of Cx43, the gap junction protein of lens epithelial cells, and on cell surface assembly/disassembly of Cx43-gap junction complexes. METHODS: Association and phosphorylation of Cx43 by PKCgamma was determined using co-immunoprecipitation and reaction with phosphoserine antisera. Activation of PKCgamma was with 200 nM phorbol ester for 30 to 60 min. Effects of specific PKC isoforms was determined after overexpression of either PKCalpha or PKCgamma for 24 h in N/N 1003A rabbit lens epithelial cells or in two retinal cell lines, WERI and Y79. Gap junction plaques were counted on the cell surface by immunolabeling of Cx43 using confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Co-immunoprecipitation of Cx43 with PKCgamma was observed only in cells over expressing PKCgamma and in cells activated with phorbol ester. Both overexpression and phorbol ester produced a rapid phosphorylation of Cx43 on serine. Cx43 cell surface gap junction plaques decreased in cells over expressing PKCgamma and in cells treated with phorbol ester. Similar results were observed using the retinal cell lines, WERI and Y79. The effect of PKCgamma overexpression was persistent for 7 days but total cell Cx43 was not decreased. Overexpression of PKCa resulted in an increase in cell surface gap junction plaques. CONCLUSIONS: PKCgamma can be co-immunoprecipitated with Cx43 from lens epithelial cells using phorbol ester activation. PKCgamma phosphorylates Cx43 on serine and this causes disassembly and loss of gap junction Cx43 from the cell surface. Overexpression of PKCgamma confirmed that only this PKC isoform caused the loss of cell surface Cx43. Overexpression of PKCalpha, the other major lens PKC isoform, caused an increase in cell surface Cx43. The presence of PKCgamma and loss of surface Cx43 from two retinal cell lines, WERI and Y79, upon phorbol ester activation further suggests that activation of PKCgamma may be a common mechanism for control of cell surface Cx43.",

In addition to identifying 36 known CaM-binding proteins, including CaM kinases, calcineurin, nNOS, the IP(3) receptor, and Ca(2+)-ATPase, we identified an ER transmembrane protein, wolframin [the product of the Wolfram syndrome gene (WFS1)] as interacting. A CaM overlay and an immunoprecipitation assay revealed that wolframin is capable of binding the Ca(2+)/CaM complex in vitro and in transfected cells. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and zero-length cross-linking showed that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 2-285) of wolframin binds to an equimolar unit of CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner with a K(D) for CaM of 0.15 muM. Various truncation and deletion mutants showed that the Ca(2+)/CaM binding region in wolframin is located from Glu90 to Trp186. Furthermore, we demonstrated that three mutations (Ala127Thr, Ala134Thr, and Arg178Pro) associated with Wolfram syndrome completely abolished CaM binding of wolframin. This observation may indicate that CaM binding is important for wolframin function and that impairment of this interaction by mutation contributes to the pathology seen in Wolfram syndrome.",

METHODS: Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing two SH2 domains of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K-GST-p85 (N-SH2), GST-p85 (C-SH2), and respective SH2 mutants (N-SH2, R358A, and C-SH2, R649A)-were prepared and used to pull down tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in bovine ROS. Protein identity was established by Western blot analysis. PI3K activity was determined in the pull-down mixtures and in immunoprecipitates by incubation with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P(2)) and [gamma(32)P]adenosine triphosphate (ATP). RESULTS: The GST pull-down assays indicated the binding of a 97-kDa protein by GST-p85 (N-SH2) in tyrosine-phosphorylated (PY)-ROS that was not present in nonphosphorylated (N)-ROS. Binding was completely abolished when the Arg 358 in the N-SH2 domain was mutated to Ala. Increased binding of the p110alpha catalytic subunit to GST-p85 (N-SH2) fusion protein was also observed in the presence of the 97-kDa phosphorylated protein. Biochemical evidence indicated that the 97-kDa protein was the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor beta-subunit (IRbeta). Immunoprecipitates of PY-ROS and N-ROS with anti-PY antibodies, probed with anti-IRbeta, indicated the presence of IRbeta only in PY-ROS. Immunoprecipitates of PY-ROS and N-ROS with anti-IRbeta antibodies, probed with anti-p85 and anti-p110alpha antibodies, indicated increased amounts of both p85 and p110alpha in PY-ROS compared to N-ROS. Treatment of ROS with insulin, followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-IRbeta or anti-PY, resulted in increased PI3K activity. Expression and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of retina insulin receptor showed direct involvement with the p85 subunit of PI3K in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor is involved in the regulation of PI3K activity in ROS.",

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a rare genetic muscle disorder, but one of the most common among the congenital myopathies. NM is caused by mutations in at least nine genes: Nebulin (NEB), \u03b1-actin (ACTA1), \u03b1-tropomyosin (TPM3), \u03b2-tropomyosin (TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), cofilin-2 (CFL2), Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain-containing 13 (KBTBD13), and Kelch-like family members 40 and 41 (KLHL40 and KLHL41). Nebulin is a giant (600 to 900\u00a0kDa) filamentous protein constituting part of the skeletal muscle thin filament. Around 90% of the primary structure of nebulin is composed of approximately 35-residue \u03b1-helical domains, which form super repeats that bind actin with high affinity. Each super repeat has been proposed to harbor one tropomyosin-binding site. METHODS: We produced four wild-type (WT) nebulin super repeats (S9, S14, S18, and S22), 283 to 347 amino acids long, and five corresponding repeats with a patient mutation included: three missense mutations (p.Glu2431Lys, p.Ser6366Ile, and p.Thr7382Pro) and two in-frame deletions (p.Arg2478_Asp2512del and p.Val3924_Asn3929del). We performed F-actin and tropomyosin-binding experiments for the nebulin super repeats, using co-sedimentation and GST (glutathione-S-transferase) pull-down assays. We also used the GST pull-down assay to test the affinity of WT nebulin super repeats for WT \u03b1- and \u03b2-tropomyosin, and for \u03b2-tropomyosin with six patient mutations: p.Lys7del, p.Glu41Lys, p.Lys49del, p.Glu117Lys, p.Glu139del and p.Gln147Pro. RESULTS: WT nebulin was shown to interact with actin and tropomyosin. Both the nebulin super repeats containing the p.Glu2431Lys mutation and nebulin super repeats lacking exon 55 (p.Arg2478_Asp2512del) showed weak affinity for F-actin compared with WT fragments. Super repeats containing the p.Ser6366Ile mutation showed strong affinity for actin. When tested for tropomyosin affinity, super repeats containing the p.Glu2431Lys mutation showed stronger binding than WT proteins to tropomyosin, and the super repeat containing the p.Thr7382Pro mutation showed weaker binding than WT proteins to tropomyosin. Super repeats containing the deletion p.Val3924_Asn3929del showed similar affinity for actin and tropomyosin as that seen with WT super repeats. Of the tropomyosin mutations, only p.Glu41Lys showed weaker affinity for nebulin (super repeat 18). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time the existence of direct tropomyosin-nebulin interactions in vitro, and show that nebulin interactions with actin and tropomyosin are altered by disease-causing mutations in nebulin and tropomyosin.",

While limb and skin-specific p63 transcriptional targets are being discovered, little is known of the post-translation modifications controlling \u0394Np63\u03b1 functions. Here we show that the p300 acetyl-transferase physically interacts in vivo with \u0394Np63\u03b1 and catalyzes its acetylation on lysine 193 (K193) inducing \u0394Np63\u03b1 stabilization and activating specific transcriptional functions. Furthermore we show that Fibroblast Growth Factor-8 (FGF8), a morphogenetic signaling molecule essential for embryonic limb development, increases the binding of \u0394Np63\u03b1 to the tyrosine kinase c-Abl as well as the levels of \u0394Np63\u03b1 acetylation. Notably, the natural mutant \u0394Np63\u03b1-K193E, associated to the Split-Hand/Foot Malformation-IV syndrome, cannot be acetylated by this pathway. This mutant \u0394Np63\u03b1 protein displays promoter-specific loss of DNA binding activity and consequent altered expression of development-associated \u0394Np63\u03b1 target genes. Our results link FGF8, c-Abl and p300 in a regulatory pathway that controls \u0394Np63\u03b1 protein stability and transcriptional activity. Hence, limb malformation-causing p63 mutations, such as the K193E mutation, are likely to result in aberrant limb development via the combined action of altered protein stability and altered promoter occupancy.

Both Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) and Ob-Ra(269 gln-->pro) have decreased cell-surface expression and decreased leptin binding affinity.

PKC zeta, the other member of the atypical PKC subfamily, could also bind FRS2. The association between FRS2 and PKC lambda is likely to be direct as shown by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The C-terminal fragments of FRS2 (amino acid residues 300-508) and SNT2 (amino acids 281-492), an isoform bearing 50% identity to FRS2, interacted with PKC lambda at a region (amino acids 240-562) that encompasses the catalytic domain. In vitro kinase assays revealed neither FRS2 nor SNT2 was a substrate of PKC lambda or zeta. Mutation of the alanine residue (Ala-120) to glutamate in the pseudo-substrate region of PKC lambda results in a constitutively active kinase that exhibited more than 2-fold greater binding to FRS2 in vitro than its \"closed\" wild-type counterpart. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 did not affect its binding to the constitutively active PKC lambda mutant, suggesting that the activation of PKC lambda is necessary and sufficient for its association with FRS2. It is likely that FRS2 serves as an anchoring protein for targeting activated atypical PKCs to the cell plasma membrane in signaling pathways.",

Mutation of Tyr-1062 (Y1062F) in the cytoplasmic tail of c-Ret abolished receptor binding and phosphorylation of the adaptor Shc and eliminated activation of Ras by GDNF. Phosphorylation of Erk kinases was also greatly attenuated but not eliminated by this mutation. This residual wave of Erk phosphorylation was independent of the kinase activity of c-Ret. Mutation of Tyr-1096 (Y1096F), a binding site for the adaptor Grb2, had no effect on Erk activation by GDNF. Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector Akt was also reduced in the Y1062F mutant but not completely abolished unless Tyr-1096 was also mutated. Ligand stimulation of neuronal cells induced the assembly of a large protein complex containing c-Ret, Grb2, and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of Shc, p85(PI3K), the adaptor Gab2, and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. In agreement with Ras-independent activation of PI3K by GDNF in neuronal cells, survival of sympathetic neurons induced by GDNF was dependent on PI3K but was not affected by microinjection of blocking anti-Ras antibodies, which did compromise neuronal survival by nerve growth factor, suggesting that Ras is not required for GDNF-induced survival of sympathetic neurons. These results indicate that upon ligand stimulation, at least two distinct protein complexes assemble on phosphorylated Tyr-1062 of c-Ret via Shc, one leading to activation of the Ras/Erk pathway through recruitment of Grb2/Sos and another to the PI3K/Akt pathway through recruitment of Grb2/Gab2 followed by p85(PI3K) and SHP-2. This latter complex can also assemble directly onto phosphorylated Tyr-1096, offering an alternative route to PI3K activation by GDNF.",

Chronically infected hosts are asymptomatic and transmit disease to na\u00efve hosts via fecal shedding of bacteria, thereby serving as a critical reservoir for disease. We show that the bacterial effector protein SseI (also called SrfH), which is translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS), is required for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI inhibits normal cell migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro, and such inhibition requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), an important regulator of cell migration. SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. The C-terminal domain of SseI is similar to PMT/ToxA, a bacterial toxin that contains a cysteine residue (C1165) that is critical for activity. Mutation of the corresponding residue in SseI (C178A) eliminates SseI function in vitro and in vivo, but not binding to IQGAP1. In addition, infection with wild-type (WT) S. typhimurium suppressed DC migration to the spleen in vivo in an SseI-dependent manner. Correspondingly, examination of spleens from mice infected with WT S. typhimurium revealed fewer DC and CD4(+) T lymphocytes compared to mice infected with Delta sseI S. typhimurium. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which ultimately counteracts the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria.",

We report that the intracellular loop immediately distal to the pore-forming P-loop M2 (M2-3 loop), as well as a short region in the C terminus, are involved in NR2-subunit specificity. Within the M2-3 loop, substitution of residue 619 in NR2A (valine) for the corresponding NR2C residue (isoleucine) reduced inactivation without affecting calcium permeability of the channel. In contrast, a Q620E mutation in NR2A reduced the relative calcium permeability without altering inactivation. Mutation of three serine/threonine residues in the M2-3 loop also reduced inactivation, as did substitution of the intracellular C terminus of NR2A for NR2C. We speculate that the M2-3 loop of NR2 modulates calcium-dependent inactivation by interacting with the NR1 C terminus, a region known to be essential for inactivation.",

Fibroblasts isolated from ILK-VT/GG mice contained mutant ILK in FAs, showed normal adhesion to and spreading on extracellular matrix substrates but displayed impaired migration. Biochemical analysis revealed that VT/GG substitutions decreased ILK protein stability leading to decreased ILK levels and reduced binding to paxillin and \u03b1-parvin. Because paxillin depletion did not affect ILK localization to FAs, the embryonic lethality and the in vitro migration defects are likely due to the reduced levels of ILK-VT/GG and diminished binding to parvins.",

Despite the high similarity in structure and function with p53, p63, and p73 function in tumor suppression is still controversial. Here, we show that TAp73alpha, a transcriptionally active p73 isoform, is able to synergize p53 tumor suppressor function in thyroid cancer cells. Indeed, depletion of p73 by small interfering RNA in thyroid cancer cells resulted in a reduced transcriptional activity of p53. Ectopic coexpression of both p53 and TAp73alpha in thyroid cancer cells resulted in increased transcription and tumor suppressor function compared with p53 or TAp73alpha alone, as well as in increased p53 protein levels. The enhancing effect of TAp73alpha on p53 activity is Mdm2 dependent because it is prevented by Mdm2 depletion by small interfering RNA. At least two mechanisms may explain the interference of TAp73alpha with p53 function. First, in thyroid cancer cells, TAp73alpha inhibits the effect of p53 on Mdm2 induction by antagonizing p53 at the Mdm2 promoter level. Second, a TAp73alpha mutant (G264W), which is devoid of DNA binding capability, is still able to increase p53 protein levels by competing with p53 for Mdm2 protein binding. Taken together, these results indicate that in thyroid cancer cells, TAp73alpha is able to increase p53 protein level and function by interfering with Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. These results may be useful for designing gene therapies aimed at restoring a normal p53 function in thyroid cancer cells.",

This phosphorylation of APS is observed in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and transfected cells. The insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of APS was inhibited by a PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY290004, a specific protein kinase B (PKB) inhibitor, deguelin, and knockdown of Akt. Serine 588 of APS is contained in a protein kinase B consensus sequence for phosphorylation conserved in APS across multiple species but not found in other members of this family, including SH2-B and Lnk. Mutation of serine 588 to alanine abolished the insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of APS and prevented the localization of APS to membrane ruffles. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 534-621 of APS was phosphorylated by purified PKB in vitro, and mutation of serine 588 abolished the PKB-mediated phosphorylation of APS in vitro. Taken together, this study identifies APS as a novel physiological substrate for PKB and the first serine phosphorylation site on APS.

Autophosphorylated CaMKII binds directly to NMDAR subunits, co-localizes with NMDARs in the postsynaptic density, and phosphorylates NR2B subunits at Ser1303. Here, we demonstrate that CaMKIIalpha enhances the extent and/or rate of desensitization of NMDA-induced macroscopic currents in HEK293 cells co-expressing NR2B with either the NR1(011) or NR1(101) splice variants, without significantly changing other current parameters.

Kinases harboring K42R (inactive kinase) or T286A (autophosphorylation-deficient) mutations are defective in enhancing the desensitization of NR1/NR2B channels. In addition, the CaMKII-dependent enhancement of NR1/NR2B channel desensitization is abrogated by intracellular loading with BAPTA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the amino acids of MDM2 that are critical for binding to p53, a modified two-hybrid screen was performed in yeast. Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed to identify MDM2 residues important for p53 interaction. Mutant MDM2 proteins were subsequently tested for their ability to bind to p53 in vitro and for their ability to regulate p53-mediated transcription in vivo. RESULTS: The yeast genetic screen yielded two Mdm2 mutations (G58D and C77Y) which disrupted binding to p53 in vitro without altering the conformation of MDM2 as determined with conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Site-directed mutagenesis yielded mutations of two additional amino acids of MDM2 (D68 and V75) that prevented binding to p53 in vitro. The mutant MDM2 proteins were unable to inhibit p53-dependent transcription in vivo, which is consistent with prior indications that a physical interaction between the two proteins is required for MDM2's inhibition of p53. Finally, the crystal structure of the MDM2-p53 complex shows that two of the four critical residues identified here contact p53 directly, while the remaining two residues play important structural roles in the MDM2 domain. CONCLUSIONS: MDM2 residues G58, D68, V75, and C77 are critical for MDM2's interaction with the p53 protein. Mutation of these residues to alanine prevents MDM2's interaction with p53 in vitro, and MDM2's regulation of p53's transcriptional activity in vivo.",

The transcriptional synergy was also affected by changes in the orientation of the Maf recognition sequence that had no detectable effect on binding affinity. The interaction between Maf and Sox proteins was visualized in living cells by bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis.

Cajal bodies and gemini of coiled bodies were closely associated with the foci occupied by R288P Maf. Wild-type Maf formed complexes with Sox proteins in the nucleoplasm, whereas R288P Maf recruited Sox proteins as well as other interaction partners to the nuclear foci.

Their expressions were demonstrated by Western blotting method. Then we used Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) methods to demonstrate the interaction of HIP-55 and 14-3-3 in HEK293 cells. Moreover, the 14-3-3 antagonist peptide, R18 and HIP-55 protein mutant plasmid HIP-55AA were used to detect the protein synthesis of HIP-55 at different time points induced by puromycin, an inhibitor of protein production. RESULTS: The HEK293 cells expressed HIP-55 protein respectively, after being transected with PDEST-N-Venus-HIP-55WT,PDEST-N-Venus-HIP-55AA,PDEST-GST-HIP-55WT plasmids and expressed 14-3-3 protein after being transected with PDEST-C-Venus-14-3-3\u03c4 plasmids. We could detect venus fluorescence of venus-HIP-55 protein via confocal microscopy in HEK 293 cells transfected with N-Venus-HIP-55 and C-14-3-3\u03c4 plasmids by BiFC, but not in HEK 293 cells transfected with N-Venus-HIP-55 AA (mutants S269A/T291A) and C-14-3-3\u03c4 plasmids. The results of BiFC suggested that 14-3-3 interacted with HIP-55 through HIP-55 S269/T291 sites. At the same time, the data of co-IP showed that there were endogenous interactions between 14-3-3 and HIP-55. Furthermore, puromycin had no influence in HIP-55 protein synthesis at hours 0, 4, or 8 in HEK 293 cells expressing GST-HIP-55WT and 14-3-3 plasmids, while puromycin blocked HIP-55 protein synthesis in HEK 293 cells transfected with N-Venus-HIP-55AA (mutants S269A/T291A) and C-14-3-3\u03c4 plasmids. The results indicated that the 14-3-3/HIP-55 complex could contributed to the stability of HIP-55.

Previous mutagenesis studies identified Val42 and Leu174 as residues that selectively affect binding of Cdc42 to ACK and WASP but not to PAK. However, it is unclear whether these discriminatory residues are sufficient determinants of specificity. In this study we sought to introduce \"gain-of function\" mutations into Rac to allow it to bind to ACK and WASP, thereby revealing all specificity determinants. Thirteen mutations were made changing Rac residues to those in Cdc42. Equilibrium binding constants of all mutant Rac proteins to ACK, WASP, and PAK were measured. A combination of seven mutations (S41A, A42V, N43T, D47G, N52T, W56F, and R174L) was determined to be necessary to change the binding affinity of Rac for ACK from negligible (K(d) < 1 microM) to a comparable affinity to Cdc42 (K(d) 25 nM). These mutations are not confined to interface residues. We interpret these data to indicate the importance of the structure of regions of the protein distinct from the contact residues. None of these mutant Rac proteins bound WASP with a similar affinity to Cdc42. Hence, residues as yet unidentified, outside the interface, must be necessary for binding WASP.",

PTEN disruption results in unrestrained fork progression upon replication stalling, which is similar to the phenotype of cells expressing the phosphomimic MCM2 mutant S41D. Moreover, PTEN is necessary for prevention of chromosomal aberrations under replication stress. This study demonstrates that PTEN regulates DNA replication through MCM2 and loss of PTEN function leads to replication defects and genomic instability. We propose that PTEN plays a critical role in maintaining genetic stability through a replication-specific mechanism, and this is a crucial facet of PTEN tumor suppressor activity. ",

In vitro translation of the cRNA generated p53 which was immunoprecipitable with all five monoclonal antibodies tested (PAb122, PAb421, PAb242, PAb246, and PAb248). The p53 sedimented at about 8-10 S in sucrose gradients, possibly corresponding to a tetramer. T-antigen-p53 complexes were produced by the addition of immunoaffinity-purified T antigen to p53-containing translation lysates. Equivalent amounts of p53 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-T-antigen antibodies PAb416, PAb419, and PAb101, suggesting that in vitro made p53 complexed mostly to a population of T-antigen molecules that had matured at least 15 min in the cell. The complexes sedimented at 18-20 S in sucrose gradients. In order to map the p53 binding site on T antigen, p53 was complexed in vitro to labeled proteolytic fragments of T antigen. A 46K fragment, spanning residues 131-517, was immunoprecipitated with the anti-p53 monoclonal PAb122 and therefore is likely to contain the p53 binding site. This region contains T-antigen sequences necessary for the efficient transformation of nonpermissive cells and for the induction of cellular rRNA synthesis. It also contains the binding sites for DNA polymerase alpha and ATP. We suggest a possible role for T-p53 complexes in T-antigen-associated functions.",

Expression of [Q71L]ARL1 in mammalian cells led to altered Golgi structure similar to, but less dramatic than, that reported previously for [Q71L]ARF1. Two previously identified partners of ARFs, MKLP1 and Arfaptin2/POR1, also bind ARL1 but not ARL2 or ARL3. Two-hybrid screens of human cDNA libraries with dominant active mutants of human ARL1, ARL2, and ARL3 identified eight different but overlapping sets of binding partners. Specific interactions between ARL1 and two binding proteins, SCOCO and Golgin-245, are defined and characterized in more detail. Like ARFs and ARL1, the binding of SCOCO to Golgi membranes is rapidly reversed by brefeldin A, suggesting the presence of a brefeldin A-sensitive ARL1 exchange factor.

We have screened 108 GJB2 heterozygous Chinese patients for mutations in GJB3 by sequencing. We have excluded the possibility that mutations in exon 1 of GJB2 and the deletion of GJB6 are the second mutant allele in these Chinese heterozygous probands. Two different GJB3 mutations (N166S and A194T) occurring in compound heterozygosity with the 235delC and 299delAT of GJB2 were identified in three unrelated families (235delC/N166S, 235delC/A194T and 299delAT/A194T). Neither of these mutations in Cx31 was detected in DNA from 200 unrelated Chinese controls. Direct physical interaction of Cx26 with Cx31 is supported by data showing that Cx26 and Cx31 have overlapping expression patterns in the cochlea. In addition, by coimmunoprecipitation of mouse cochlear membrane proteins, we identified the presence of heteromeric Cx26/Cx31 connexons. Furthermore, by cotransfection of mCherry-tagged Cx26 and GFP-tagged Cx31 in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, we demonstrated that the two connexins were able to co-assemble in vitro in the same junction plaque.

Insulin or IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation of Ser(302) in various cell backgrounds and in murine muscle.

We have recently shown that the E3-10.4K/14.5K (RIDalpha/beta) complex downregulates tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) expression at the plasma membrane. To study the role of the RIDbeta tyrosine sorting motif in the removal of surface TNFR1, tyrosine 122 on RIDbeta was mutated to alanine or phenylalanine. Both RIDbeta mutations not only abolished the downregulation of surface TNFR1 but paradoxically increased surface TNFR1 levels. RID also downregulates other death receptors, such as FAS; however, surface FAS expression was not increased by RIDbeta mutants, suggesting that regulation of TNFR1 and that of FAS by RID are mechanistically different. In the mixing experiments, the wild-type (WT) RID-mediated TNFR1 downregulation was partially inhibited in the presence of RIDbeta mutants, indicating that the mutants compete for TNFR1 access. Indeed, an association between RIDbeta and TNFR1 was shown by coimmunoprecipitation. In contrast, the mutants did not affect the WT RID-induced downregulation of FAS. These differential effects support a model in which RID associates with TNFR1 on the plasma membrane, whereas RID probably associates with FAS in a cytoplasmic compartment. By using small interfering RNA against the mu2 subunit of adaptor protein 2, dominant negative dynamin construct K44A, and the lysosomotropic agents bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride, we also demonstrated that surface TNFR1 was internalized by RID by a clathrin-dependent process involving mu2 and dynamin, followed by degradation of TNFR1 via an endosomal/lysosomal pathway.",

This response was abrogated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed a direct interaction of cytosol-localized thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1 and the p85alpha subunit of PI3K. T3 treatment rapidly increased PI3K activity by 52 +/- 3% (p < 0.005), which resulted in increased phosphorylation of downstream kinases Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This effect was abrogated by pretreatment with wortmannin or LY294002. Phosphorylation of p70(S6K), a known target of mTOR, occurred rapidly following T3 treatment and was inhibited by rapamycin and wortmannin. In contrast, phosphorylation of the p85 variant of S6K in response to T3 was not blocked by LY294002, wortmannin, or rapamycin, thus supporting a T3-activated pathway independent of PI3K and mTOR. 40 S ribosomal protein S6, a target of p70(S6K), and 4E-BP1, a target of mTOR, were both phosphorylated within 15-25 min of T3 treatment and could be inhibited by wortmannin and rapamycin.

NKCC1 function, which we measured in Xenopus laevis oocytes under both isosmotic (basal) and hyperosmotic (stimulated) conditions, was unaffected when SPAK and WNK4 were expressed alone. In contrast, expression of both kinases with NKCC1 resulted in a significant increase in cotransporter activity and an insensitivity to external osmolarity or cell volume. NKCC1 activation is dependent on the catalytic activity of SPAK and likely also of WNK4, because mutations in their catalytic domains result in an absence of cotransporter stimulation. The results of our yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that WNK4 does not interact directly with NKCC1 but does interact with SPAK. Functional experiments demonstrated that the binding of SPAK to WNK4 was also required because a SPAK-interaction-deficient WNK4 mutant (Phe997Ala) did not increase NKCC1 activity. We also have shown that the transport function of K+-Cl- cotransporter type 2 (KCC2), a neuron-specific KCl cotransporter, was diminished by the expression of both kinases under both isosmotic and hyposmotic conditions.

Data from bone marrow transplantation models suggest that STAT5 activation does not account for the entire disease phenotype induced by TEL-JAK2. This study examined additional signaling pathways that are activated by TEL-JAK2. TEL-JAK2 expression in Ba/F3 cells results in constitutive association and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and Ship-1 and, consequently, recruitment of Grb2 to TEL-JAK2. Direct Grb2 recruitment is also possible because a putative Grb2 binding site, Tyr314, is present on TEL-JAK2(5-19) and TEL-JAK2(5-12). Studies with a TEL-JAK2(5-19)Tyr314Phe mutant support a role for Tyr314 in Grb2 recruitment, because Grb2 association with TEL-JAK2(5-19)Tyr314Phe is significantly reduced. Interestingly, TEL-JAK2(5-19)Tyr314Phe shows reduced Ras activation when compared with TEL-JAK2(4-17), TEL-JAK2(5-12), and TEL-JAK2(5-19).

We investigated whether this domain might itself regulate G protein activity by assessing the abilities of G18 and mutants thereof to modulate the nucleotide binding and hydrolytic properties of Galpha(i1) and Galpha(o). Surprisingly, in the presence of fluoroaluminate (AlF(4)(-)) both G proteins bound strongly to full-length G18 (G18wt) and to its isolated N-terminal domain (G18DeltaC) but not to its GoLoco region (DeltaNG18). Thus, it appears that its N-terminal domain promotes G18 binding to fluoroaluminate-activated Galpha(i/o). Neither G18wt nor any G18 mutant affected the GTPase activity of Galpha(i1) or Galpha(o). In contrast, complex effects were noted with respect to nucleotide binding. As inferred by the binding of [(35)S]GTPgammaS (guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) to Galpha(i1), the isolated GoLoco region as expected acted as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, whereas the N-terminal region exhibited a previously unknown guanine nucleotide exchange factor effect on this G protein. On the other hand, the N terminus inhibited [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(o), albeit to a lesser extent than the effect of the GoLoco region on Galpha(i1). Taken together, our results identify the N-terminal region of G18 as a novel G protein-interacting domain that may have distinct regulatory effects within the G(i/o) subfamily, and thus, it could potentially play a role in differentiating signals between these related G proteins.",

These experiments demonstrate that homotypic D4 interactions probably mediated by salt bridges between Arg-385 and Glu-390 play an important role in activation of PDGFRbeta and all type III receptor tyrosine kinases. We also used a chemical cross-linking agent to covalently cross-link PDGF-stimulated cells to demonstrate that a Glu390Ala mutant of PDGFRbeta undergoes typical PDGF-induced receptor dimerization. However, unlike WT PDGFR that is expressed on the surface of ligand-stimulated cells in an active state, PDGF-induced Glu390Ala dimers are inactive. Although the conserved amino acids that are required for mediating D4 homotypic interactions are crucial for PDGFRbeta activation, these interactions are dispensable for PDGFRbeta dimerization. Moreover, PDGFRbeta dimerization is necessary but not sufficient for tyrosine kinase activation.",

Previously we have demonstrated the utility of F29W and F105W mutants of TnC for measurement of binding affinities of inhibitory peptide TnI(96-116) to its regulatory N and structural C domains, both in isolation and in the intact TnC molecule [Pearlstone, J. R. & Smillie, L. B. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6932-6940]. This approach is now extended to fragment TnI(96-148). Curve-fitting analyses of fluorescence changes induced in the intact TnC mutants and the isolated N and C domains by increasing [TnI(96-148)] have permitted the assignments of K(D) values (designated K(D,N) and K(D,C)) to the interaction of TnI(96-148) with the N and C domains, respectively, of intact TnC. Taken together with the previous data for TnI(96-116) binding, it can be concluded that, within TnI(96-148), residues 96-116 are primarily responsible for binding to C domain of intact TnC and residues 117-148 to its N domain. Inspection of the available mammalian and avian skeletal muscle TnI amino acid sequences reveals a previously unrecognized conserved motif repeated 3-fold, once in the inhibitory peptide region (approximately residues 101-114; designated alpha) and twice more in the region of residues approximately 121-132 (beta) and approximately 135-146 (gamma). The number and distribution of these motifs have important structural implications for the TnI x C complex. In the beta motif of cardiac TnI, as compared with skeletal, several changes in charged amino acids are suggested as candidates responsible for the greater sensitivity of cardiac Ca2+-regulated actomyosin to acidic pH as in ischemia.",

A key negative regulator of circadian rhythm in mammals is the PER2 (mammalian PERIOD 2) protein. Its daily degradation at the end of the night accompanies de-repression of transcription. CKI (casein kinase I ) has been identified as the kinase that phosphorylates PER2, targeting it for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. We now report that PER2 degradation is also negatively regulated by PP1 (protein phosphatase 1)-mediated dephosphorylation. In Xenopus egg extract, PP1 inhibition by Inhibitor-2 accelerated mPER2 degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PER2 bound to PP1c in transfected HEK-293 cells. PP1 immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cells, mouse liver and mouse brain, dephosphorylated CKI-phosphorylated PER2, showing that PER2 is a substrate for mammalian endogenous PP1. Moreover, over-expression of the dominant negative form of PP1c, the D95N mutant, accelerated ubiquitin and proteasome-mediated degradation of PER2, and shortened the PER2 half-life in HEK-293 cells. Over-expression of the PP1 inhibitors, protein phosphatase 1 holoenzyme inhibitor-1 and Inhibitor-2, confirmed these results. Thus PP1 regulates PER2 stability and is therefore a candidate to regulate mammalian circadian rhythms.",

METHODS: N/N1003A lens epithelial cells, bovine primary lens epithelial cells, and stably transfected N/N1003A lens epithelial cells were used. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were used to detect protein expression and their interactions. Cav-1-containing lipid rafts and redistribution of Cav-1, PKCgamma, and Cx43 were analyzed by sucrose gradients and by consequent Western blot analysis. Cell surface gap junction Cx43 plaques were detected by confocal microscopy. PKCgamma activity was measured with a PKC assay kit. RESULTS: Cav-1 and -2 were found in N/N1003A and bovine primary lens epithelial cells. Cx43 was associated with Cav-1 in lipid rafts. Phorbol ester (TPA) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 recruited PKCgamma into Cav-1-containing lipid rafts and stimulated the interactions of PKCgamma with Cav-1 and Cx43. TPA and IGF-1 induced redistribution of Cav-1 and Cx43 from light-density fractions to higher density fractions on sucrose gradients. PKCgamma redistributed with Cav-1- and Cx43-containing fractions on stimulation with TPA or IGF-1. Overexpression of PKCgamma-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) increased the interaction of PKCgamma-EGFP with Cav-1 and Cx43 and decreased gap junction Cx43 plaques without exogenous growth factors. Overexpression of a loss-of-function PKCgamma mutant did not decrease gap junction Cx43 plaques or cause redistribution in lipid rafts, even though the PKCgamma mutant still interacted with Cav-1 and Cx43. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of PKCgamma by TPA or IGF-1 stimulated the interaction of PKCgamma with Cav-1 and Cx43 in lipid rafts, causing Cx43, Cav-1, and PKCgamma to redistribute within the lipid rafts, and this resulted in a decrease in gap junction plaques.",

Peptide mass fingerprinting of peptides defined by MALDI-MS was then utilized to identify phosphorylated proteins detected by autoradiography. Six candidate substrates were identified, including the p16 subunit of the seven-member Arp2/3 complex (p16-Arc).

To further study the effect of Cytc phosphorylation in vitro, we generated T28E phosphomimetic Cytc, revealing superior behavior regarding protein stability and its ability to degrade reactive oxygen species compared with wild-type unphosphorylated Cytc Introduction of T28E phosphomimetic Cytc into Cytc knock-out cells shows that intact cell respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), and ROS levels are reduced compared with wild type.

Structure-function studies of the 551 amino acid PKR kinase from human cells have revealed that catalytic-deficient PKR mutants such as PKR(1-551)K296R display a dominant negative behavior when expressed in transfected cells. The potential for PKR to form protein multimers has therefore been examined. Three types of studies, including both genetic and biochemical analyses, demonstrated that PKR from human cells undergoes an intermolecular association that is not dependent upon RNA. First, the intermolecular association of PKR in vitro was demonstrated in the context of an enzyme-substrate interaction. Purified recombinant histidine-tagged PKR(1-551)K296R mutant protein was phosphorylated by purified wild-type PKR; this intermolecular phosphorylation of PKR was dependent on double-stranded RNA. At a fixed RNA concentration, high concentrations of the HIS-PKR(1-551)K296R mutant both impaired the autophosphorylation of wild-type PKR and blocked the trans-phosphorylation of itself. Second, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to probe the intermolecular association of PKR in vivo. Coexpression of the full-length catalytic-deficient phosphotransfer mutant PKR(1-551)K296R as a fusion protein with the Gal4 activation domain and the Gal4 DNA binding domain resulted in the expression of two Gal4-responsive reporter genes, HIS3 and lacZ. The full-length RNA-binding deficient PKR(1-551)K64E/K296R double mutant also interacted with PKR(1-551)K296R sufficiently to activate Gal4-responsive reporter genes; however, other PKR mutants including PKR(1-280)wt and PKR(281-551)K296R as well as p53, RAS, and BCL2 did not. Third, both PKR(1-551)K296R and PKR(1-551)K64E/K296R enhanced the expression of the reovirus S1 gene and S1/S4 chimeric gene in cotransfected COS cells. By contrast, the expression of the reovirus S4 gene was not enhanced by cotransfection with either PKR(1-551)K296R or PKR(1-551)K64E/K296R. These results indicate that PKR interacts with itself in an intermolecular manner both in vivo and in vitro, and that RNA binding is neither necessary nor sufficient for PKR multimerization.",

Despite their importance, the signalling cascades that regulate cilium formation remain incompletely understood. Here we report that prostaglandin signalling affects ciliogenesis by regulating anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT). Zebrafish leakytail (lkt) mutants show ciliogenesis defects, and the lkt locus encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCC4). We show that Lkt/ABCC4 localizes to the cell membrane and exports prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a function that is abrogated by the Lkt/ABCC4(T804M) mutant. PGE2 synthesis enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 and its receptor, EP4, which localizes to the cilium and activates the cyclic-AMP-mediated signalling cascade, are required for cilium formation and elongation. Importantly, PGE2 signalling increases anterograde but not retrograde velocity of IFT and promotes ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings lead us to propose that Lkt/ABCC4-mediated PGE2 signalling acts through a ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor, EP4, to upregulate cAMP synthesis and increase anterograde IFT, thereby promoting ciliogenesis.",

Inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi) have shown high response rates and extended survival in patients with melanoma who bear tumors that express mutations encoding BRAF proteins mutant at Val600, but a vast majority of these patients develop drug resistance. Here we show that loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK). Our studies unveil a previously unknown genetic mechanism of BRAFi resistance and provide new insights into the tumor suppressor function of STAG2 and STAG3.",

Recent work has demonstrated direct interaction of Homer proteins with type 1 and type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoforms. Moreover, Homer proteins have been shown to modulate RyR-dependent Ca2+ release in isolated channels as well as in whole cell preparations. We now show that long and short forms of Homer H1 (H1c and H1-EVH1) are potent activators of Ca2+ release via RyR in skeletal muscle fibers (e.g. Ca2+ sparks) and potent modulators of ryanodine binding to membranes enriched with RyR, with H1c being significantly more potent than H1-EVH1. Homer did not significantly alter the spatio-temporal properties of the sparks, demonstrating that Homer increases the rate of opening of RyRs, with no change in the overall RyR channel open time and amount of Ca2+ released during a spark. No changes in Ca2+ spark frequency or properties were observed using a full-length H1c with mutation in the EVH1 binding domain (H1c-G89N). One novel finding with each Homer agonist (H1c and H1-EVH1) was that in combination their actions on [3H]ryanodine binding was additive, an effect also observed for these Homer agonists in the Ca2+ spark studies. Finally, in Ca2+ spark studies, excess H1c-G89N prevented the effects of H1c in a dominant negative manner. Taken together our results suggest that the EVH1 domain is critical for the agonist behavior on Ca2+ sparks and ryanodine binding, and that the coiled-coil domain, present in long but not short form Homer, confers an increase in agonist potential apparently through the multimeric association of Homer ligand.",

Raf/Arg89 in the center of the binding interface plays an important role determining Ras-Raf binding affinity. We have investigated experimentally and computationally the Raf-R89K mutation, which abolishes signaling in vivo. The binding to [gamma-35S]GTP-Ras of a fusion protein between the Raf-binding domain (RBD) of Raf and GST was reduced at least 175-fold by the mutation, corresponding to a standard binding free energy decrease of at least 3.0 kcal/mol. To compute this free energy and obtain insights into the microscopic interactions favoring binding, we performed alchemical simulations of the RBD, both complexed to Ras and free in solution, in which residue 89 is gradually mutated from Arg into Lys. The simulations give a standard binding free energy decrease of 2.9+/-1.9 kcal/mol, in agreement with experiment. The use of numerous runs with three different force fields allows insights into the sources of uncertainty in the free energy and its components. The binding decreases partly because of a 7 kcal/mol higher cost to desolvate Lys upon binding, compared to Arg, due to better solvent interactions with the more concentrated Lys charge in the unbound state. This effect is expected to be general, contributing to the lower propensity of Lys to participate in protein-protein interfaces. Large contributions to the free energy change also arise from electrostatic interactions with groups up to 8 A away, namely residues 37-41 in the conserved effector domain of Ras (including 4 kcal/mol from Ser39 which loses a bifurcated hydrogen bond to Arg89), the conserved Lys84 and Lys87 of Raf, and 2-3 specific water molecules.

Unlike the WT beta1-AR, intrinsic activities of full and partial agonists in activating the Lys324-->Ala beta1-AR (K324A) mutant were correlated with their binding affinities to the K324A mutant. In assays, such as agonist-mediated phosphorylation and recycling, the K324A mutant and the WT beta1-AR behaved similarly. However, in fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays that determined the proximity between the WT beta1-AR or the K324A mutant to G(s)alpha, there were significant differences. The conceptual framework of the ternary complex model could not adequately account for the behavior of the K324A mutant except under assumptions of low receptor-G protein binding affinities. The single low-affinity binding site of the K324A mutant to isoproterenol was converted by the C-terminal 11-amino-acid peptide of G(s)alpha, which acts a GDP-bound G(s)alpha mimic, to high- and low-affinity sites. Based upon the three-dimensional architecture of the human beta1-AR, the distance between Lys324 and the Asp/Glu-Arg-Tyr motif in helix 3 was the shortest among the various amino acids in helix 6. These findings indicate that Lys324 lies in a groove between helices 3 and 6, and its mutagenesis generates a mutant receptor with very low binding affinity for the GDP-bound isoform of G(s).",

Recent evidence has established that the cation-independent (CI) and cation-dependent (CD) mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) bind specifically to the VHS domains of the GGAs through acidic cluster-dileucine motifs at the carboxyl ends of their cytoplasmic tails. However, the CD-MPR binds the VHS domains more weakly than the CI-MPR. Alignment of the C-terminal residues of the two receptors revealed a number of non-conservative differences in the acidic cluster-dileucine motifs and the flanking residues. Mutation of these residues in the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail to the corresponding residues in the CI-MPR conferred either full binding (H63D mutant), intermediate binding (R60S), or unchanged binding (E56F/S57H) to the GGAs as determined by in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Furthermore, the C-terminal methionine of the CD-MPR, but not the C-terminal valine of the CI-MPR, inhibited GGA binding. Addition of four alanines to the C-terminal valine of the CI-MPR also severely reduced GGA binding, demonstrating the importance of the spacing of the acidic cluster-dileucine motif relative to the C terminus for optimal GGA interaction. Mouse L cells stably expressing CD-MPRs with mutations that enhance GGA binding sorted cathepsin D more efficiently than wild-type CD-MPR. These studies provide an explanation for the observed differences in the relative affinities of the two MPRs for the GGA proteins. Furthermore, they indicate that the GGAs participate in lysosomal enzyme sorting mediated by the CD-MPR.",

SAP97 and alphaCaMKII display a high co-localization pattern in hippocampal neurons as well as in transfected COS-7 cells. Metabolic labeling of hippocampal cultures reveals that N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activation induces CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97; co-incubation with the CaMKII-specific inhibitor KN-93 reduces SAP97 phosphorylation to basal levels. Our results show that SAP97 directly interacts with the NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor both in an in vitro \"pull-out\" assay and in co-immunoprecipitation experiments from homogenates and synaptosomes purified from hippocampal rat tissue. Interestingly, in the postsynaptic density fraction, SAP97 fails to co-precipitate with NR2A. We show here that SAP97 is directly associated with NR2A through its PDZ1 domain, and CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 disrupts NR2A interaction both in an in vitro pull-out assay and in transfected COS-7 cells. Moreover, expression of SAP97(S232D) mutant has effects similar to those observed upon constitutively activating CaMKII.

We here examined the functions of these three mutants of Csx/Nkx-2.5.

They are subject to post-translational modification by phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine residues. Recent evidence suggested that STATs are methylated on a conserved arginine residue within the N-terminal region. STAT arginine methylation has been described to be important for STAT function and loss of arginine methylation was discussed to be involved in interferon resistance of cancer cells. Here we provide several independent lines of evidence indicating that the issue of arginine methylation of STATs has to be reassessed. First, we show that treatment of melanoma and fibrosarcoma cells with inhibitors used to suppress methylation (N-methyl-2-deoxyadenosine, adenosine, dl-homocysteine) had profound and rapid effects on phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 but also on p38 and Erk signaling cascades which are known to cross-talk with the Jak/STAT pathway. Second, we show that anti-methylarginine antibodies did not precipitate specifically STAT1 or STAT3. Third, we show that mutation of Arg(31) to Lys led to destabilization of STAT1 and STAT3, implicating an important structural role of Arg(31). Finally, purified catalytically active protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1, -2, -3, -4, and -6) did not methylate STAT proteins, and cotransfection with PRMT1 did not affect STAT1-controlled reporter gene activity. Taken together, our data suggest the absence of arginine methylation of STAT1 and STAT3.",

Cleavage of CHL1-Fc in the 125-kDa fragment was not detectable under non-reducing conditions arguing that cleavage resulting in the 165-kDa fragment is more relevant in releasing soluble CHL1 in vivo. In cells transfected with full-length ADAM8, membrane proximal cleavage of CHL1 was similar and not stimulated by phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and pervanadate. No cleavage of CHL1 was observed in cells expressing either inactive ADAM8 with a Glu330 to Gln exchange (EQ-A8), or active ADAM10 and ADAM17. Consequently, processing of CHL1 was hardly detectable in brain extracts of ADAM8-deficient mice but enhanced in a neurodegenerative mouse mutant. CHL1 processed by ADAM8 in supernatants of COS-7 cells and in co-culture with cerebellar granule neurons was very potent in stimulating neurite outgrowth and suppressing neuronal cell death, not observed in cells co-transfected with CHL1/EQ-A8, CHL1/ADAM10, or CHL1/ADAM17.

Separate kinase-inactivating mutations in the EGF receptor and ErbB2 proteins abolished ErbB3 phosphorylation and signal transduction activated by EGF and HRG respectively.

For the cleavage of eIF4GI, caspase-3 activity is both necessary and sufficient in vivo, in a process which does not require signaling through the p38 MAP kinase pathway. We now show that activation of the Fas/CD95 receptor promotes an early, transient increase in the level of eIF2alpha phosphorylation, which is temporally correlated with the onset of the inhibition of translation. This is associated with a modest increase in the autophosphorylation of the protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA. Using a Jurkat cell line that is deficient in caspase-8 and resistant to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis, we show that whilst the cleavage of eIF4GI is caspase-8-dependent, the enhancement of eIF2alpha phosphorylation does not require caspase-8 activity and occurs prior to the cleavage of eIF4GI. In addition, activation of the Fas/CD95 receptor results in the caspase-8-dependent dephosphorylation and degradation of p70(S6K), the enhanced binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E, and, at later times, the cleavage of eIF2alpha. These data suggest that apoptosis impinges upon the activity of several polypeptides which are central to the regulation of protein synthesis and that multiple signaling pathways are involved in vivo.",

SARA, a FYVE finger protein, binds to membrane lipids suggesting that activated receptors may interact with downstream signaling molecules at discrete endocytic locations. In the present study, we reveal a critical role for the early endocytic compartment in regulating Smad-dependent signaling. Not only is SARA localized on early endosomes, but also its minimal FYVE finger sequence is sufficient for early endosomal targeting. Expression of a SARA mutant protein lacking the FYVE finger inhibits downstream activin A signaling in endothelial cells. Moreover, a dominant-negative mutant of Rab5, a crucial protein for early endosome dynamics, causes phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smads leading to constitutive (i.e. ligand independent) transcriptional activation of a Smad-dependent promoter in endothelial cells. As inhibition of endocytosis using the K44A negative mutant of dynamin and RN-tre did not lead to activation of Smad-dependent transcription, the effects of the dominant-negative Rab5 are likely to be a consequence of altered membrane trafficking of constitutively formed TGFbeta/activin type I/II receptor complexes at the level of early endosomes. The results suggest an important interconnection between early endosomal dynamics and TGFbeta/activin signal transduction pathways.",

It interacts with elastin, fibrillin-1 and collagen IV as well as with lysyl oxidases and is involved in elastogenesis and cross-link formation. To date, several mutations in the fibulin-4 gene (FBLN4/EFEMP2) are known in patients whose major symptoms are vascular deformities, aneurysm, cutis laxa, joint laxity, or arachnodactyly. The pathogenetic mechanisms how these mutations translate into the clinical phenotype are, however, poorly understood. In order to elucidate these mechanisms, we expressed fibulin-4 mutants recombinantly in HEK293 cells, purified the proteins in native forms and analyzed alterations in protein synthesis, secretion, matrix assembly, and interaction with other proteins in relation to wild type fibulin-4. Our studies show that different mutations affect these properties in multiple ways, resulting in fibulin-4 deficiency and/or impaired ability to form elastic fibers. The substitutions E126K and C267Y impaired secretion of the protein, but not mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the E126K mutant showed less resistance to proteases, reduced binding to collagen IV and fibrillin-1, as well as to LTBP1s and LTBP4s. The A397T mutation introduced an extra O-glycosylation site and deleted binding to LTBP1s. We show that fibulin-4 binds stronger than fibulin-3 and -5 to LTBP1s, 3, and 4s, and to the lysyl oxidases LOX and LOXL1; the binding of fibulin-4 to the LOX propeptide was strongly reduced by the mutation E57K. These findings show that different mutations in the fibulin-4 gene result in different molecular defects affecting secretion rates, protein stability, LOX-induced cross-linking, or binding to other ECM components and molecules of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, and thus illustrate the complex role of fibulin-4 in connective tissue assembly.",

We used a novel approach to detect changes in the hormone-binding domain of ERalpha, based on the evidence that antiestrogens, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (ZOHT) and ICI 182,780, block the function of ERalpha by binding and folding the AF-2 transcriptional domain in a way that inhibits its association with coactivator proteins. We have identified a Helix 12 mutation, M543V, which leads to greater ERalpha transcription with ZOHT and other antiestrogens (including 1,1-dichloro-2,2,3-triarylcyclopropanes, DTACs) than with 17-beta estradiol (E2). We also found an independent mutation at the same position, M543I, which did not show this inverted ligand phenotype. In comparison to further Helix 12 mutations made in vitro, it appears that relative hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains on the inner face of Helix 12 is key to maintaining the transcriptionally active, agonist conformation with bound E2. This active conformation can be induced, resulting in increased transcription, by adding excess p160 coactivator AIB1 in transcriptional assays with E2-bound receptors, while the ZOHT-bound receptors were not further activated by AIB1. Other experiments show that the cross talk between ERalpha and AP-1 protein from AP-1-binding sites is not dependent on Helix 12 integrity. We show that two alleles containing a proline substitution in Helix 12 that inactivate AF-2 function of ERalpha at EREs have little negative effect on function through AP-1 elements, supporting a prominent role for the N-terminal AF-1 of ERalpha in AP-1/ERalpha transcriptional cross talk.",

Here, we show that the Cspg2(Delta3/Delta3) fibroblasts within 20 passages proliferate more slowly and acquire senescence. Whereas the extracellular matrix of the wild type fibroblasts exhibited a network structure of hyaluronan and versican, that of the Cspg2(Delta3/Delta3) fibroblasts exhibited approximately 35 and approximately 85% deposition of versican and HA, without such a structure. The Cspg2(Delta3/Delta3) fibroblasts showed a substantial increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression of senescence markers p53, p21, and p16. Treatment of wild type fibroblasts with hyaluronidase and exogenous hyaluronan enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and treatment with an anti-CD44 antibody that blocks HA-CD44 interaction inhibited the phosphorylation.

We screened a kinase inhibitor library, using A549 cells that are transduced with a lentivirus keratin 18 (K18) construct, to identify compounds that normalize filament disruption due to K18 Arg90Cys mutation at the conserved arginine. High-throughput screening showed that PKC412, a multikinase inhibitor, ameliorated K18 Arg90Cys-mediated keratin filament disruption in cells and in the livers of previously described transgenic mice that overexpress K18 Arg90Cys. Furthermore, PKC412 protected cultured A549 cells that express mutant or wild-type K18 and mouse livers of the K18 Arg90Cys-overexpressing transgenic mice from Fas-induced apoptosis. Proteomic analysis of proteins that associated with keratins after exposure of K18-expressing A549 cells to PKC412 showed that nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIA (NMHC-IIA) partitions with the keratin fraction. The nonmuscle myosin-IIA (NM-IIA) association with keratins was confirmed by immune staining and by coimmunoprecipitation. The keratin-myosin association is myosin dephosphorylation-dependent; occurs with K8, the obligate K18 partner; is enhanced by PKC412 in cells and mouse liver; and is blocked by hyperphosphorylation conditions in cultured cells and mouse liver. Furthermore, NMHC-IIA knockdown inhibits PKC412-mediated normalization of K18 R90C filaments. CONCLUSION: The inhibitor PKC412 normalizes K18 Arg90Cys mutation-induced filament disruption and disorganization by enhancing keratin association with NM-IIA in a myosin dephosphorylation-regulated manner. Targeting of intermediate filament disorganization by compounds that alter keratin interaction with their associated proteins offers a potential novel therapeutic approach for keratin and possibly other intermediate filament protein-associated diseases.",

Here we report that RTKs can directly modulate the function of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) through post-translational modification. In vitro kinase assays revealed that both the epidermal growth factor and platelet derived growth factor receptors (EGFR and PDGFR, respectively) tyrosine phosphorylate PKA-C. Mass spectrometry identified tyrosine 330 (Y330) as a receptor-mediated phosphorylation site and mutation of Y330 to phenylalanine (Y330F) all but abolished the RTK-mediated phosphorylation of PKA-C in vitro. Y330 resides within a conserved region at the C-terminal tail of PKA-C that allosterically regulates enzymatic activity. Therefore, the effect of phosphorylation at Y330 on the activity of PKA-C was investigated. The K(m) for a peptide substrate was markedly decreased when PKA-C subunits were tyrosine phosphorylated by the receptors as compared to un-phosphorylated controls. Importantly, tyrosine-phosphorylated PKA-C subunits were detected in cells stimulated with EGF, PDGF, and Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and in fibroblasts undergoing PDGF-mediated chemotaxis. These results demonstrate a direct, functional interaction between RTKs and PKA-C and identify tyrosine phosphorylation as a novel mechanism for regulating PKA activity.",

          "text": "INTRODUCTION: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta suppresses breast cancer formation by preventing cell cycle progression in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). During the course of mammary tumorigenesis, genetic and epigenetic changes negate the cytostatic actions of TGF-beta, thus enabling TGF-beta to promote the acquisition and development of metastatic phenotypes. The molecular mechanisms underlying this conversion of TGF-beta function remain poorly understood but may involve signaling inputs from integrins. METHODS: beta3 Integrin expression or function in MECs was manipulated by retroviral transduction of active or inactive beta3 integrins, or by transient transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against beta3 integrin. Altered proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) stimulated by TGF-beta in control and beta3 integrin manipulated MECs was determined. Src involvement in beta3 integrin mediated alterations in TGF-beta signaling was assessed by performing Src protein kinase assays, and by interdicting Src function pharmacologically and genetically. RESULTS: TGF-beta stimulation induced alphavbeta3 integrin expression in a manner that coincided with EMT in MECs. Introduction of siRNA against beta3 integrin blocked its induction by TGF-beta and prevented TGF-beta stimulation of EMT in MECs. beta3 integrin interacted physically with the TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR) type II, thereby enhancing TGF-beta stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and of Smad2/3-mediated gene transcription in MECs. Formation of beta3 integrin:TbetaR-II complexes blocked TGF-beta mediated growth arrest and increased TGF-beta mediated invasion and EMT. Dual beta3 integrin:TbetaR-II activation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TbetaR-II, a phosphotransferase reaction mediated by Src in vitro. Inhibiting Src activity in MECs prevented the ability of beta3 integrin to induce TbetaR-II tyrosine phosphorylation, MAPK activation, and EMT stimulated by TGF-beta. Lastly, wild-type and D119A beta3 integrin expression enhanced and abolished, respectively, TGF-beta stimulation of invasion in human breast cancer cells. CONCLUSION: We show that beta3 integrin alters TGF-beta signaling in MECs via Src-mediated TbetaR-II tyrosine phosphorylation, which significantly enhanced the ability of TGF-beta to induce EMT and invasion. Our findings suggest that beta3 integrin interdiction strategies may represent an innovative approach to re-establishing TGF-beta mediated tumor suppression in progressing human breast cancers.",

Here, we demonstrate the utility of the protein-based inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin Portland (alpha1-PDX) as an antipathogenic agent that can be used prophylactically to block furin-dependent cell killing by Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Biochemical analysis of the specificity of a bacterially expressed His- and FLAG-tagged alpha1-PDX (alpha1-PDX/hf) revealed the selectivity of the alpha1-PDX/hf reactive site loop for furin (Ki, 600 pM) but not for other proprotein convertase family members or other unrelated endoproteases. Kinetic studies show that alpha1-PDX/hf inhibits furin by a slow tight-binding mechanism characteristic of serpin molecules and functions as a suicide substrate inhibitor. Once bound to furin's active site, alpha1-PDX/hf partitions with equal probability to undergo proteolysis by furin at the C-terminal side of the reactive center -Arg355-Ile-Pro-Arg358- downward arrow or to form a kinetically trapped SDS-stable complex with the enzyme. This partitioning between the complex-forming and proteolytic pathways contributes to the ability of alpha1-PDX/hf to differentially inhibit members of the proprotein convertase family. Finally, we propose a structural model of the alpha1-PDX-reactive site loop that explains the high degree of enzyme selectivity of this serpin and which can be used to generate small molecule furin inhibitors.",

The molecular requirements for high affinity inhibition by PKI were deduced from the crystal structure of the cAMP kinase/PKI complex. A prominent site of interaction are residues Tyr235 and Phe239 in the catalytic subunit, which from a sandwich-like structure with Phe10 of the PKI(5-24) peptide. To increase the sensitivity for PKI, the cGMP kinase codons at the corresponding sites, Ser555 and Ser559, were changed to Tyr and Phe. The mutant cGMP kinase was stimulated half maximally by cGMP at 3-fold higher concentrations (240 nM) than the wild type (77 nM). Wild type and mutant cGMP kinase did not differ significantly in their Km and Vmax for three different substrate peptides. The PKI(5-24) peptide inhibited phosphotransferase activity of the mutant cGMP kinase with higher potency than that of wild type, with Ki values of 42 +/- .3 microM and 160 +/- .7 microM, respectively. The increased affinity of the mutant cGMP kinase was specific for the PKI(5-24) peptide. Mutation of the essential Phe10 in the PKI(5-24) sequence to an Ala yielded a peptide that inhibited mutant and wild type cGMP kinase with similar potency, with Ki values of 160 +/- 11 and 169 +/- 27 microM, respectively.

SHP-1 is a trkA phosphatase that dephosphorylates trkA at tyrosines (Y) 674 and 675. p53 can induce trkA activation and tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of NGF stimulation. In breast cancer tumours trkA expression is associated with increased patient survival. TrkA protein expression is higher in breast-cancer cell lines than in normal breast epithelia. In cell lines (but not in normal breast epithelia) trkA is functional and can be NGF-stimulated to promote cell proliferation. This study investigates the functional relationship between trkA, p53 and SHP-1 in breast-cancer, and reveals that in wild-type (wt) trkA expressing breast-cancer cells both endogenous wtp53, activated by therapeutic agents, and transfected wtp53 repress expression of SHP-1 through the proximal CCAAT sequence of the SHP-1-P1-promoter and the transcription factor NF-Y. In these cells trkA-Y674/Y675 phosphorylation is detected when SHP-1 protein levels decrease in a wtp53-dependent manner. Proliferation and cell-cycle assays, with cells expressing endogenous or transfected wt-trkA and a temperature-sensitive p53 grown at 32 degrees C (when p53 is in the wt configuration), show suppressed cell proliferation. Suppression is not detected when grown at 37 degrees C (when p53 is in the mutant configuration). A release from suppression is observed when these cells are transiently transfected with wt-SHP-1 and grown at 32 degrees C. Suppression is also detected when, as control, wt-trkA-expressing cells are transiently transfected with SHP-1-siRNA, but not when a dominant-negative (DN) mutant trkA is used to abolish wt-trkA activity. Importantly, suppression is not seen with control trkA-negative breast-cancer cells (expressing wtp53, wt-SHP-1 and undetectable trkA), transfected with Y674F/Y675F mutant-trkA. BrdU-incorporation experiments reveal lack of incorporation in cells expressing wt-trkA and wtp53, or wt-trkA and SHP-1-siRNA. However, BrdU is incorporated in the presence of Y674F/Y675F mutant trkA or DN mutant trkA. These results indicate that p53 repression of SHP-1 expression leads to trkA-Y674/Y675 phosphorylation and trkA-dependent suppression of breast-cancer cell proliferation. These data provide an explanation as to why high trkA levels are associated with favourable prognosis.",

          "text": "The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex constitutively expressed on the platelet plasma membrane mediates initial adhesion of circulating platelets to vessel wall matrix at high shear, and shear-induced platelet aggregation. In both cases, this involves binding of GP Ib-IX-V to the adhesive glycoprotein, von Willebrand Factor (vWF). vWF binding to GP Ib-IX-V rapidly induces platelet activation, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement, shape change, and secretion that enables alphaIIbbeta3 integrin (GP IIb-IIIa)-dependent platelet aggregation. All these events are critical in (patho)physiological thrombus formation. The recent discovery that the signaling protein, 14-3-3 zeta, copurifies with the GP Ib-IX complex (minus GP V) [Du, X., Harris, S. J., Tetaz, T. J., Ginsberg, M. H., & Berndt, M. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18287-18290] indicated a potential mechanism for vWF-dependent signaling. The aim of the present study was to identify discrete amino acid sequences that bind 14-3-3 zeta within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. As an initial screening assay, overlapping synthetic peptides based on the cytoplasmic domains of GP Ibalpha (100 residues), GP Ibbeta (34 residues), GP IX (5 residues), and GP V (16 residues) were immobilized and assessed for the ability to bind purified 14-3-3 zeta. The C-terminal sequence GHSL of GP Ibalpha was identified as one 14-3-3 zeta interactive sequence, consistent with previous results [Du, X., Fox, J. E., & Pei, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 7362-7367]. Binding of 125I-labeled 14-3-3 zeta to GHSL-containing peptides was inhibitable by unlabeled 14-3-3 zeta and by anti-14-3-3 zeta IgG. Ala-walking through the GHSL sequence suggested all residues were necessary for optimal binding. In addition, 14-3-3 zeta bound with lower affinity to a peptide based on the central region of the GP Ibalpha cytoplasmic domain (Arg-557-Gly-575), whereas peptide sequences within the cytoplasmic domains of GP Ibbeta (Arg-160-Arg-175) and GP V (Lys-529-Gly-544) bound 14-3-3 zeta with comparable affinity to the GHSL-containing peptide. Soluble GHSL-containing peptides, GP Ibbeta- and GP V-based peptides semidissociated 14-3-3 zeta from GP Ib-IX-V or GP Ib-IX in platelet extracts as analyzed by immunoprecipitation, suggesting these sequences, at least partially, mediate the GP Ib-IX-V-14-3-3 zeta interaction in cells. Further, phosphorylation of the GP Ibbeta peptide at a site corresponding to a protein kinase A phosphorylation site (Ser-166) enhanced the affinity of 14-3-3 zeta binding by approximately 8-fold, suggesting phosphorylation as a potential mechanism for regulating 14-3-3 zeta association with the GP Ib-IX-V complex.",

We report here that, upon pervanadate (PV) treatment, Siglec-7 recruited the protein tyrosine phosphatases Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and SHP-2 less efficiently than did other inhibitory receptors such as Siglec-9 and leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor (LAIR-1). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the two Siglecs revealed only three amino acids difference in these motifs. To identify the amino acid(s) critical to recruitment efficiency, we prepared a series of Siglec-7-based mutants in which each of the three amino acids were replaced with the corresponding one of Siglec-9 (I435L, P439S, and N458T mutants). P439S and N458T mutants showed pronounced enhancement of SHP recruitment, but I435L mutant had little effect. A double mutant (P439S, N458T) or triple mutant (I435L, P439S, N458T) recruited SHPs as much as did Siglec-9, indicating that Pro439 in the proximal motif and Asn458 in the distal motif of Siglec-7 attenuate its ability to recruit phosphatases.

Recently we reported that Tax inhibits p53 function in Jurkat cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts through a mechanism involving the nuclear factor kappa B pathway and correlates with phosphorylation on serines 15 and 392 of p53. However, several groups have also observed a mechanism that correlates with p300 binding of Tax. To address this controversy and to determine the mechanism by which Tax inhibits p53 function, we examined the activation functions of Tax required for p53 inhibition. In HeLa and H1299 cells the cAMP-response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor activation function is essential, as demonstrated by the Tax mutants M47 and K88A. In addition, expression of exogenous p300 in H1299 cells allows full recovery of p53 transactivation in the presence of Tax. Consistent with p300 being a limiting factor in H1299, Saos-2, and HeLa cells, we found that the level of endogenous p300 is relatively low in these cells compared with Jurkat cells or the human T-lymphotropic virus type I-infected C81 and MT2 cells. Thus our data suggests that Tax utilizes distinct mechanisms to inhibit p53 function that are cell type-dependent.",

Several previous reports have indicated that Daxx is induced upon oxidative stress and is then subjected to phosphorylation-based functional modification. However, the precise molecular events underlying these phosphorylation events remain largely unknown. We report in our current study that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is highly overexpressed in malignant human gliomas and inhibits Daxx-mediated cellular apoptosis. The targeted inhibition of Pin1 by small interfering RNA in A172 glioblastoma cells significantly enhances the apoptotic response induced by hydrogen peroxide or stimulatory Fas antibodies. This is in turn accompanied by the increased induction of Daxx and the activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Furthermore, Pin1 binds to the phosphorylated Ser178-Pro motif in the Daxx protein, and Pin1 overexpression results in the rapid degradation of Daxx via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, a Daxx-S178A mutant, which cannot interact with Pin1, demonstrates higher proapoptotic activity and is refractory to Pin1-mediated antiapoptotic effects. We further found that the expression levels of Pin1 inversely correlate with the degree of Daxx nuclear accumulation in human glioblastoma tissues. These results together indicate that Pin1-mediated prolyl isomerization plays an important role in the negative regulation of Daxx and thereby inhibits the oxidative stress-induced cellular apoptotic response, particularly in malignant tumor cells where Pin1 is often overexpressed.",

To determine the molecular mechanism by which this polymorphism may be linked to insulin resistance, we produced recombinant peptides comprising amino acid residues 925-1008 from IRS-1 that contain either a glycine or arginine at codon 972 and the two nearby tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sites (EY(941)MLM and DY(989)MTM), which are known binding sites for the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The wild type peptide could be phosphorylated at these sites in vitro by purified insulin receptor. Introduction of the G972R polymorphism into the peptide reduced the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation by >60%. Pull-down experiments indicated that there was an association between the IRS-1-(925-1008) peptide and the insulin receptor that was markedly enhanced by the presence of the G972R polymorphism. The use of additional overlapping fragments localized this interaction to domains between residues 950-986 of IRS-1 and residues 966-1271 of the insulin receptor, containing the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor. In addition, the IRS-1-(925-1008) G972R peptide acted as a competitive inhibitor of insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor autophosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that the G972R naturally occurring polymorphism of IRS-1 not only reduces phosphorylation of the substrate but allows IRS-1 to act as an inhibitor of the insulin receptor kinase, producing global insulin resistance.",

Classification of missense variants as neutral or disease causing is still a challenge and has major implications for genetic counseling. BRCA1 is organized in an N-terminal ring-finger domain and two BRCT (breast cancer C-terminus) domains, involved in protein-protein interaction. The integrity of the C-terminal, BRCT repeat region is also critical for BRCA1 tumor suppressor function. Several molecular partners of BRCA1 have so far been identified; among them, the tumor suppressor protein p53 seems to play a major role. This study was aimed at evaluating the impact of two missense mutations, namely the W1837R and the S1841N, previously identified in BOC patients and located in the BRCT domain of the BRCA1 gene, on the binding capacity of this protein to p53. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of E. coli-expressed wild-type and mutated BRCTs challenged with a HeLa cell extract revealed, for the S1841N variant a significant reduction in the binding activity to p53, while the W1837R mutant showed an inverse effect. Furthermore, a clonogenic soft agar growth assay performed on HeLa cells stably transfected with either wild-type or mutant BRCA1 showed a marked decrease of the growth in wild-type BRCA1-overexpressing cells and in BRCA1S1841N-transfected cells, while no significant changes were detected in the BRCA1W1837R-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that: i) distinct single nucleotide changes in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 affect binding of this protein to the tumor suppressor p53, and ii) the two missense mutations here described are likely to play a role in breast tumorigenesis. We suggest that in vitro/in vivo experiments testing the effects of unclassified BRCA1 gene variants should therefore be taken in to consideration and that increased surveillance should be adopted in individuals bearing these two BRCA1 missense alterations.",

It has been suggested that KCNE2 has the most promiscuity of function which can interact with multiple-subunits of voltage-dependent cation channels and modulate their functions. However, whether KCNE2 regulates voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2)(+) channel (LCC) remains unknown. This study investigated the possible role of KCNE2 in regulating cardiac LCCs and the pathophysiological relevance of this regulation. We found that overexpression of KCNE2 in Sprague-Dawley rat cardiomyocytes decreased L-type Ca(2+)current (ICa,L), whereas KCNE2 knockdown by RNA interference increased ICa,L. Upregulation of KCNE2 caused a slight positive shift of the voltage-dependent activation and a negative shift of the steady-state voltage-dependent inactivation, and slowed the recovery from inactivation of ICa,L, while knockdown of KCNE2 had the contrary effects. Similar regulation of ICa,L magnitude had been observed in transfected HEK 293 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization assays in both cardiomyocytes and the transfected cell line suggest that Cav1.2 physically interacted with KCNE2. Deletion of the N-terminal inhibitory module (NTI) of Cav1.2 results in the large loss of KCNE2 regulation of ICa,L and interaction with Cav1.2. Furthermore, we found that the familial atrial fibrillation related KCNE2 mutation R27C enhanced the effect of KCNE2 on suppressing ICa,L. Taken together, our findings indicate that KCNE2 modulates ICa,L by regulating NTI function of Cav1.2. The KCNE2 mutation R27C may induce familial atrial fibrillation partially through enhancing the suppression of ICa,L.",

Phosphoproteomic studies have identified 13 sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in emerin. We validated one study, confirming that emerin is hyper-tyrosine-phosphorylated in Her2-overexpressing cells. We discovered that non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src and Abl each phosphorylate emerin and a related protein, LAP2beta, directly. Src phosphorylated emerin specifically at Y59, Y74 and Y95; the corresponding triple Y-to-F (;FFF') mutation reduced tyrosine phosphorylation by approximately 70% in vitro and in vivo. Substitutions that removed a single hydroxyl moiety either decreased (Y19F, Y34, Y161F) or increased (Y4F) emerin binding to BAF in cells. Y19F, Y34F, Y161F and the FFF mutant also reduced recombinant emerin binding to BAF from HeLa lysates, demonstrating the involvement of both LEM-domain and distal phosphorylatable tyrosines in binding BAF. We conclude that emerin function is regulated by multiple tyrosine kinases, including Her2, Src and Abl, two of which (Her2, Src) regulate striated muscle. These findings suggest roles for emerin as a downstream effector and ;signal integrator' for tyrosine kinase signaling pathway(s) at the nuclear envelope.",

Although the role of oncogenic Ras in a variety of cellular responses including transformation, cell survival, differentiation, and migration is well documented, the direct Ras/effector interactions that contribute to the different Ras biological end points have not been as clearly defined. Observations by other groups in which Ras-dependent transformation can be blocked by expression of either dominant negative forms of Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase or PTEN, a 3-phosphoinositide-specific phosphatase, support an essential role for PI 3-kinase and its lipid products in the transformation process. These observations coupled with the in vitro observations that the catalytic subunits of PI 3-kinase, the p110 isoforms, bind directly to Ras-GTP foster the implication that a direct interaction between an oncogenic Ras protein and PI 3-kinase are causal in the oncogenicity of mutant Ras proteins. Using an activated Ha-Ras protein (Y64G/Y71G/F156L) that fails to interact with PI 3-kinase, we demonstrate that oncogenic Ha-Ras does not require a direct interaction with PI 3-kinase to support anchorage-independent growth of IEC-6 epithelial cells. We do find, however, that IEC-6 cells expressing an oncogenic Ha-Ras protein that no longer binds PI 3-kinase are greatly impaired in their ability to migrate toward fibronectin.",

Prereplication complexes are assembled on all origins in G(1) phase, and yet only a subset of complexes is activated during S phase by DDK (for Dbf4-dependent kinase) (Cdc7-Dbf4). The yeast mcm5-bob1 (P83L) mutation bypasses DDK but results in reduced intrinsic firing efficiency at 11 endogenous origins and at origins located on minichromosomes. Origin efficiency may result from Mcm5 protein assuming an altered conformation, as predicted from the atomic structure of an archaeal MCM (for minichromosome maintenance) homologue. Similarly, an intragenic mutation in a residue predicted to interact with P83L suppresses the mcm5-bob1 bypass phenotype. We propose DDK phosphorylation of the MCM complex normally results in a single, highly active conformation of Mcm5, whereas the mcm5-bob1 mutation produces a number of conformations, only one of which is permissive for origin activation. Random adoption of these alternate states by the mcm5-bob1 protein can explain both how origin firing occurs independently of DDK and why origin efficiency is reduced. Because similar mutations in mcm2 and mcm4 cannot bypass DDK, Mcm5 protein may be a unique Mcm protein that is the final target of DDK regulation.",

To examine the role of I(134)-H(145) in the ligand-C5aR interaction, we connected this peptide to the C-terminus of C5a (C5a/RP S19) and found that it endowed the second binding moiety of RP S19 (L(131)DR) with a relatively higher binding affinity to the C5aR on a human mast cell line, HMC-1. In contrast to the C5aR, the second C5aR C5L2 worked as a decoy receptor. As a result, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) downstream of the Gi protein exchanged extracellular-signal regulated kinase for p38MAPK. This alternative p38MAPK activation could be pharmacologically suppressed not only by the downregulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by LY294002, but also by the over-activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The activation was reproduced upon C5a-C5aR interaction by a simultaneous suppression of PI3K and phospholipase C with LY294002 and U73122 at low concentrations. Moreover, p38MAPK phosphorylation upstream of the pertussis toxin-dependent extracellular Ca(2+) entry was also suppressed by high concentrations of MgCl(2), which blocks melastatin-type transient receptor potential Ca(2+) channels (TRPMs). The active conformation of C5aR upon the ligation by C5a, at least on HMC-1 cells, is changed by the additional interaction of the I(134)-H(145) peptide, which seems to guide the alternative activation of p38MAPK. This activation is then amplified by a novel positive feedback loop between p38MAPK and TRPM.",

Protein kinase casein kinase II (CK2) is increased in response to diverse growth stimuli and is aberrantly elevated in a variety of human cancers. Rhabdomyosarcoma tumors are the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in childhood. In this investigation, we demonstrate that CK2 is a key survival factor that protects tumor cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We have demonstrated that inhibition of CK2 phosphorylation events by 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB) resulted in dramatic sensitization of tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. CK2 inhibition also induced rapid cleavage of caspase-8, -9, and -3, as well as the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase after TRAIL treatment. Overexpression of Bcl-2 protected cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the presence of the CK2 inhibitor. Death signaling by TRAIL in these cells was Fas-associated death domain and caspase dependent because dominant negative Fas-associated death domain or the cowpox interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor protein cytokine response modifier A prevented apoptosis in the presence of DRB. Analysis of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation demonstrated that inhibition of CK2 by DRB increased the level of recruitment of procaspase-8 to the DISC and enhanced caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid, thereby increasing the release of the proapoptotic factors cytochrome c, HtrA2/Omi, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria, with subsequent degradation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). To further interfere with CK2 function, JR1 and Rh30 cells were transfected with either short hairpin RNA targeted to CK2alpha or kinase-inactive CK2alpha (K68M) or CK2alpha' (K69M). Data show that the CK2 kinase activity was abrogated and that TRAIL sensitivity in both cell lines was increased. Silencing of CK2alpha expression with short hairpin RNA was also associated with degradation of XIAP. These findings suggest that CK2 regulates TRAIL signaling in rhabdomyosarcoma by modulating TRAIL-induced DISC formation and XIAP expression.",

Here, we report a KCNQ1 allele encoding an A590T mutation [KCNQ1(A590T)] found in a 39-year-old female with a mild QT prolongation. A590 is located in the C-terminal \u03b1 helical region of KCNQ1 that mediates subunit tetramerization, membrane trafficking, and interaction with Yotiao. This interaction is known to be required for the proper modulation of IKs by cAMP. Since previous studies reported that mutations in the vicinity of A590 impair IKs channel surface expression and function, we examined whether and how the A590T mutation affects the IKs channel. Electrophysiological measurements in HEK-293T cells showed that the A590T mutation caused a reduction in IKs density and a right-shift of the current-voltage relation of channel activation. Immunocytochemical and immunoblot analyses showed the reduced cell surface expression of KCNQ1(A590T) subunit and its rescue by coexpression of the wild-type KCNQ1 [KCNQ1(WT)] subunit. Moreover, KCNQ1(A590T) subunit interacted with Yotiao and had a cAMP-responsiveness comparable to that of KCNQ1(WT) subunit. These findings indicate that the A590 of KCNQ1 subunit plays important roles in the maintenance of channel surface expression and function via a novel mechanism independent of interaction with Yotiao.",

In vitro, p38 kinase phosphorylated p53 at Ser33 and Ser46, a newly identified site. Mutation of these sites decreased p53-mediated and UV-induced apoptosis, and the reduction correlated with total abrogation of UV-induced phosphorylation on Ser37 and a significant decrease in Ser15 phosphorylation in mutant p53 containing alanine at Ser33 and Ser46. Inhibition of p38 activation after UV irradiation decreased phosphorylation of Ser33, Ser37 and Ser15, and also markedly reduced UV-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.

Loss of PTEN function is associated with constitutive survival signaling through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway. Therefore, we asked if reconstitution of PTEN function would lead to the reversal of resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of PTEN completely suppressed constitutive Akt activation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and enhanced apoptosis induced by a broad range of apoptotic stimuli. PTEN expression sensitized cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor, anti-Fas antibody, and TRAIL. PTEN also sensitized cells to non-receptor mediated apoptosis induced by a kinase inhibitor staurosporine and chemotherapeutic agents mitoxantrone and etoposide. PTEN-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and was inhibited by a broad specificity caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Bcl-2 overexpression also blocked PTEN-mediated apoptosis. Lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for apoptosis as the PTEN G129E mutant selectively deficient in lipid phosphatase activity was unable to sensitize cells to apoptosis. PTEN-mediated apoptosis involves a FADD-dependent pathway for both death receptor-mediated and drug-induced apoptosis as coexpression of a dominant negative FADD mutant blocked PTEN-mediated apoptosis. Since in death receptor signaling, FADD mediates activation of caspase-8, which in turn cleaves BID, and since caspase-8 is activated in PTEN-mediated apoptosis, we examined BID cleavage in PTEN-mediated apoptosis. PTEN facilitated BID cleavage after treatment with low doses of staurosporine and mitoxantrone. BID cleavage was inhibited by dominant negative FADD. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that PTEN promotes drug-induced apoptosis by facilitating caspase-8 activation and BID cleavage through a FADD-dependent pathway.",

Here we report the effects of mutations in the 2nd and 3rd intracellular loops of AT2 on AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Mutating the highly conserved DRY motif (D141G-R142G-Y143A) of the 2nd ICL implicated in activating G(alpha) subunit of trimeric G-proteins did not affect AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Moreover, anti-Gialpha antibody or phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX did not inhibit AT2-mediated cGMP reduction, suggesting that Gialpha activation and subsequent phosphodiesterase activation are not involved in this function. In contrast, mutations T250R-R251N and L255F-K256R located in the C-terminus of the 3rd ICL of AT2 retained ligand-binding properties of the wild-type AT2, and its ability to interact with the ErbB3 in yeast two-hybrid assay, but abolished AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Similarities in the roles of ICLs of AT2 in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in oocytes, and AT2-mediated SHP1 activation in COS-7 cells, (need of 3rd ICL for both functions and lack of involvement of DRY motif), suggest that the cascade of events in these two signaling mechanisms could be similar, and that an oocyte-specific SHP1-like protein may be involved in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in these cells.",

The Ras homologue Rap1A is incapable of activating Raf-1 and even antagonizes Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. We proposed previously that this property of Rap1A may be attributable to its greatly enhanced interaction with Raf-1 CRD compared to Ras. On the other hand, B-Raf, another Raf family member, is activatable by both Ras and Rap1A. When interactions with Ras and Rap1A were measured, B-Raf CRD did not exhibit the enhanced interaction with Rap1A, suggesting that the strength of interaction at CRDs may account for the differential action of Rap1A on Raf-1 and B-Raf. The importance of the interaction at the CRD is further supported by a domain-shuffling experiment between Raf-1 and B-Raf, which clearly indicated that the nature of CRD determines the specificity of response to Rap1A: Raf-1, whose CRD is replaced by B-Raf CRD, became activatable by Rap1A, whereas B-Raf, whose CRD is replaced by Raf-1 CRD, lost its response to Rap1A. Finally, a B-Raf CRD mutant whose interaction with Rap1A is selectively enhanced was isolated and found to possess the double mutation K252E/M278T. B-Raf carrying this mutation was not activated by Rap1A but retained its response to Ras. These results indicate that the strength of interaction with Ras and Rap1A at its CRD may be a critical determinant of regulation of the Raf kinase activity by the Ras family small GTPases.",

Previous research has demonstrated a requirement for SNARE-dependent membrane traffic in integrin trafficking, as well as cell adhesion and migration. The goal of the present research was to ascertain whether SNARE-dependent membrane trafficking is required specifically for integrin-mediated signaling. Membrane traffic was inhibited in Chinese hamster ovary cells by expression of dominant-negative (E329Q) N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) or a truncated form of the SNARE SNAP23. Integrin signaling was monitored as cells were plated on fibronectin under serum-free conditions. E329Q-NSF expression inhibited phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on Tyr397 at early time points of adhesion. Phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr576, Tyr861 and Tyr925 was also impaired by expression of E329Q-NSF or truncated SNAP23, as was trafficking, localization and activation of Src and its interaction with FAK. Decreased FAK-Src interaction coincided with reduced Rac activation, decreased focal adhesion turnover, reduced Akt phosphorylation and lower phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels in the cell periphery. Over-expression of plasma membrane-targeted Src or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) rescued cell spreading and focal adhesion turnover. The results suggest that SNARE-dependent trafficking is required for integrin signaling through a FAK/Src/PI3K-dependent pathway.",

This pathway leads to persistent PKC activation and is important for sustaining fibroblast migration. However, questions remain regarding how G\u03b112 specifically activates ARAF, which transcription factor is involved in G\u03b112-mediated RFFL expression, and whether RFFL is important for cell migration stimulated by other signaling mechanisms that can activate ERK. In this study, we show that replacement of the G\u03b112 residue Arg-264 with Gln, which is the corresponding G\u03b113 residue, abrogates the ability of G\u03b112 to interact with or activate ARAF. We also show that G\u03b112 can no longer interact with and activate an ARAF mutant with its C-terminal sequence downstream of the kinase domain being replaced with the corresponding CRAF sequence. These results explain why G\u03b112, but not G\u03b113, specifically activates ARAF but not CRAF. Together with our finding that recombinant G\u03b112 is sufficient for stimulating the kinase activity of ARAF, this study reveals an ARAF activation mechanism that is different from that of CRAF. In addition, we show that this G\u03b112-ARAF-ERK pathway stimulates RFFL transcription through the transcription factor c-Myc. We further demonstrate that EGF, which signals through CRAF, and an activated BRAF mutant also activate PKC and stimulate cell migration through up-regulating RFFL expression.

The predicted drug- and ATP-binding sites reside at the interface between the TMDs and NBDs, respectively. Crystal structures and EM projection images suggest that the two halves of P-gp are separated by a central cavity that closes upon binding of nucleotide. Binding of drug substrates may induce further structural rearrangements because they stimulate ATPase activity.

It was found that cross-linking of cysteines that lie close to the LSGGQ (P517C) and Walker A (I1050C) sites of NBD1 and NBD2, respectively, as well as the cytoplasmic extensions of TM segments 3 (D177C or L175C) and 9 (N820C) with a short cross-linker activated ATPase activity over 10-fold. A pyrylium compound that inhibits ATPase activity blocked cross-linking at these sites. Cross-linking between the NBDs was not inhibited by tariquidar, a drug transport inhibitor that stimulates P-gp ATPase activity but is not transported. Cross-linking between extracellular cysteines (T333C/L975C) predicted to lock P-gp into a conformation that prevents close NBD association inhibited ATPase activity.

Only DDK substrates important for replication and recombination have been identified. Consequently, the mechanism by which DDK regulates mutagenesis is unknown. The yeast mcm5-bob1 mutation that bypasses DDK's essential role in DNA replication was used here to examine whether loss of DDK affects spontaneous as well as induced mutagenesis. Using the sensitive lys2\u0394A746 frameshift reversion assay, we show DDK is required to generate \"complex\" spontaneous mutations, which are a hallmark of the Pol\u03b6 translesion synthesis DNA polymerase. DDK co-immunoprecipitated with the Rev7 regulatory, but not with the Rev3 polymerase subunit of Pol\u03b6. Conversely, Rev7 bound mainly to the Cdc7 kinase subunit and not to Dbf4. The Rev7 subunit of Pol\u03b6 may be regulated by DDK phosphorylation as immunoprecipitates of yeast Cdc7 and also recombinant Xenopus DDK phosphorylated GST-Rev7 in vitro. In addition to promoting Pol\u03b6-dependent mutagenesis, DDK was also important for generating Pol\u03b6-independent large deletions that revert the lys2\u0394A746 allele. The decrease in large deletions observed in the absence of DDK likely results from an increase in the rate of replication fork restart after an encounter with spontaneous DNA damage. Finally, nonepistatic, additive/synergistic UV sensitivity was observed in cdc7\u0394 pol32\u0394 and cdc7\u0394 pol30-K127R,K164R double mutants, suggesting that DDK may regulate Rev7 protein during postreplication \"gap filling\" rather than during \"polymerase switching\" by ubiquitinated and sumoylated modified Pol30 (PCNA) and Pol32.",

The activation of MLKL occurs in a multimolecular complex (the 'necrosome'), which is comprised of MLKL, receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase (RIPK)-3 (RIPK3) and, in some cases, RIPK1. Within this complex, RIPK3 phosphorylates the activation loop of MLKL, promoting conformational changes and allowing the formation of MLKL oligomers, which migrate to the plasma membrane. Previous studies suggested that RIPK3 could phosphorylate the murine MLKL activation loop at Ser345, Ser347 and Thr349. Moreover, substitution of the Ser345 for an aspartic acid creates a constitutively active MLKL, independent of RIPK3 function. Here we examine the role of each of these residues and found that the phosphorylation of Ser345 is critical for RIPK3-mediated necroptosis, Ser347 has a minor accessory role and Thr349 seems to be irrelevant. We generated a specific monoclonal antibody to detect phospho-Ser345 in murine cells. Using this antibody, a series of MLKL mutants and a novel RIPK3 inhibitor, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Ser345 is not required for the interaction between RIPK3 and MLKL in the necrosome, but is essential for MLKL translocation, accumulation in the plasma membrane, and consequent necroptosis.",

We recently reported that these regions may interact when Ser-23/Ser-24 are phosphorylated, weakening the interaction of cTnI with cardiac TnC. Little is known about how these mutations influence the affinity of cardiac TnC for cTnI (KC-I) or contractile kinetics during \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Here, we tested how cTnI(R146G) or cTnI(R21C) influences contractile activation and relaxation and their response to protein kinase A (PKA). Both mutations significantly increased Ca(2+) binding affinity to cTn (KCa) and KC-I. PKA phosphorylation resulted in a similar reduction of KCa for all complexes, but KC-I was reduced only with cTnI(WT). cTnI(WT), cTnI(R146G), and cTnI(R21C) were complexed into cardiac troponin and exchanged into rat ventricular myofibrils, and contraction/relaxation kinetics were measured \u00b1 PKA phosphorylation. Maximal tension (Tmax) was maintained for cTnI(R146G)- and cTnI(R21C)-exchanged myofibrils, and Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension (pCa50) was increased. PKA phosphorylation decreased pCa50 for cTnI(WT)-exchanged myofibrils but not for either mutation. PKA phosphorylation accelerated the early slow phase relaxation for cTnI(WT) myofibrils, especially at Ca(2+) levels that the heart operates in vivo. Importantly, this effect was blunted for cTnI(R146G)- and cTnI(R21C)-exchanged myofibrils. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest both mutations inhibit formation of intra-subunit contacts between the N terminus and the inhibitory peptide of cTnI that is normally seen with WT-cTn upon PKA phosphorylation. Together, our results suggest that cTnI(R146G) and cTnI(R21C) blunt PKA modulation of activation and relaxation kinetics by prohibiting cardiac-specific N-terminal interaction with the cTnI inhibitory peptide.",

Here we report studies on the interaction of the PH domain of PLC-gamma1 with translational elongation factor (EF)-1alpha, which has been shown to be a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activator. By pull-down of cell extract with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with various domains of PLC-gamma1 followed by peptide sequence analysis, we identified EF-1alpha as a binding partner of a split PH domain of PLC-gamma1. Analysis by site-directed mutagenesis of the PH domain revealed that the beta2-sheet of a split PH domain is critical for the interaction with EF-1alpha. Moreover, Dot-blot assay shows that a split PH domain specifically binds to phosphoinositides including phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). So the PH domain of PLC-gamma1 binds to both EF-1alpha and PIP(2). The binding affinity of EF-1alpha to the GST.PH domain fusion protein increased in the presence of PIP(2), although PIP(2) does not bind to EF-1alpha directly. This suggests that EF-1alpha may control the binding affinity between the PH domain and PIP(2). PLC-gamma1 is substantially activated in the presence of EF-1alpha with a bell-shaped curve in relation to the molar ratio between them, whereas a double point mutant PLC-gamma1 (Y509A/F510A) that lost its binding affinity to EF-1alpha shows basal level activity. Taken together, our data show that EF-1alpha plays a direct role in phosphoinositide metabolism of cellular signaling by regulating PLC-gamma1 activity via a split PH domain.",

Under saturating conditions the rate constant for the RanGAP1 stimulated GTPase reaction is 2.1 s-1 at 25 degrees C, which is a 10(5)-fold stimulation, whereas RanGAP1 has no effect on Ran(Q69L). The intrinsic guanine nucleotide dissociation rates of Ran are also very low and are likewise increased 10(5)-fold by the exchange factor RCC1.

The Ran(T24N) mutant, which is analogous to the S17N mutant of p21ras, has decreased relative affinities for both GDP/GTP and favors GDP binding.

Previous studies indicate that ZIC3 protein can bind to the GLI consensus binding site (GLIBS) and physically interact with GLI3, a transcription factor involved in multiple aspects of neural and skeletal development. We investigated in vitro interactions of ZIC3 with GLI3 and the effect of ZIC3 mutations identified in patients with either heterotaxy or isolated cardiovascular malformations. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that all five intact zinc finger (ZF) domains were necessary for binding of ZIC3 to GLIBS. Inclusion of GLIBS upstream of a basal TK promoter had no effect on the activation of the promoter by ZIC3 alone, but it enhanced the synergistic activation of ZIC3 and GLI3. Wild-type (WT) ZIC3 showed specific binding to GLI3 in GST-pull-down assays. Nonsense and frameshift ZIC3 mutants lacking one or more of the zinc finger domains did not physically interact with GST-GLI3; however, two missense mutants c.1213A>G (p.K405E, fifth ZF domain), and c.649C>G (p.P217A, conserved N-terminal domain) retained binding. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that both p.P217A and p.K405E mutants also retained coactivation with GLI3 of reporter gene expression activity, while all the GLI3-nonbinding ZIC3 mutants lacked this activity. Interestingly, no CNS or skeletal abnormalities were observed in patients bearing the p.P217A or p.K405E mutations.",

It has been shown that GluR1-containing AMPA receptors are inserted into synapses following stimuli leading to plasticity and that GluR2/GluR3-containing receptors replace existing synaptic AMPA receptors continuously and may act to maintain synaptic efficacy. Maintaining GluR2/GluR3 receptors level in synapse requires interactions of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) with GluR2. To assess possible roles of NSF-GluR2 interaction in rat lateral amygdala (LA) in fear memory formation we used a specific GluR2-NSF interaction inhibitory peptide (pep-R845A). This inhibitory peptide, composed of a modified NSF binding site of GluR2, was previously shown to interact specifically with NSF and to affect AMPA-mediated synaptic efficacy. The inhibitory peptide was linked to a TAT peptide (TAT-pep-R845A) to facilitate internalization into LA cells. Infusion of the TAT-pep-R845A inhibitory peptide into LA 30 min before fear conditioning led to a significant impairment of long-term fear memory formation. In contrast, the control TAT peptide alone had no effect on fear memory. Injection of TAT-pep-R845A peptide into LA had no effect on short-term fear memory. In addition, the inhibitory peptide had no effect on memory retrieval when injected into LA 30 min before fear memory test. Furthermore, maintenance of memory was not impaired when the peptide was injected 24 h after fear conditioning and fear memory was tested 48 h afterward. These results show that GluR2-NSF interaction in LA is necessary for fear memory consolidation but not retrieval or persistence.",

Abnormal RyR2 channel function results in the generation of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanistic basis of RyR2 dysfunction in inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present several lines of complementary evidence, indicating that the arrhythmia-associated L433P mutation disrupts RyR2 N-terminus self-association. A combination of yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and chemical cross-linking assays collectively demonstrate that a RyR2 N-terminal fragment carrying the L433P mutation displays substantially reduced self-interaction compared with wild type. Moreover, sucrose density gradient centrifugation reveals that the L433P mutation impairs tetramerization of the full-length channel. [(3)H]Ryanodine-binding assays demonstrate that disrupted N-terminal intersubunit interactions within RyR2(L433P) confer an altered sensitivity to Ca(2+) activation. Calcium imaging of RyR2(L433P)-expressing cells reveals substantially prolonged Ca(2+) transients and reduced Ca(2+) store content indicating defective channel closure. Importantly, dantrolene treatment reverses the L433P mutation-induced impairment and restores channel function. CONCLUSION: The N-terminus domain constitutes an important structural determinant for the functional oligomerization of RyR2. Our findings are consistent with defective N-terminus self-association as a molecular mechanism underlying RyR2 channel deregulation in inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. Significantly, the therapeutic action of dantrolene may occur via the restoration of normal RyR2 N-terminal intersubunit interactions.",

Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is phosphorylated on multiple sites, and stimulation of a number of growth factor receptors and/or protein kinases leads to ligand-independent and/or synergistic increase in transcriptional activation by ERalpha in the presence of estrogen. Here we show that ERalpha is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) on serine-236 within the DNA binding domain. Mutation of serine-236 to glutamic acid prevents DNA binding by inhibiting dimerization by ERalpha, whereas mutation to alanine has little effect on DNA binding or dimerization. Furthermore, PKA overexpression or activation of endogenous PKA inhibits dimerization in the absence of ligand. This inhibition is overcome by the addition of 17beta-estradiol or the partial agonist 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. Interestingly, treatment with the complete antagonist ICI 182,780 does not overcome the inhibitory effect of PKA activation. Our results indicate that in the absence of ligand ERalpha forms dimers through interaction between DNA binding domains and that dimerization mediated by the ligand binding domain only occurs upon ligand binding but that the complete antagonist ICI 182,780 prevents dimerization through the ligand-binding domain. Heterodimer formation between ERalpha and ERbeta is similarly affected by PKA phosphorylation of serine 236 of ERalpha. However, 4-hydroxytamoxifen is unable to overcome inhibition of dimerization by PKA. Thus, phosphorylation of ERalpha in the DNA binding domain provides a mechanism by which dimerization and thereby DNA binding by the estrogen receptor is regulated.",

The effect of simultaneous replacement of both His-75 and His-84 was neither additive nor synergistic.

IbTX-D19Y/Y36F and [127I]IbTX-D19Y/Y36F block maxi-K channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with equal potency as wild-type IbTX (Kd approximately 1 nM). Under low ionic strength conditions, [125I]IbTX-D19Y/Y36F binds with high affinity to smooth muscle sarcolemmal maxi-K channels (Kd of 5 pM as determined by either equilibrium binding or kinetic binding analysis), and with a binding site density of 0.45 pmol/mg of protein. Competition studies with wild-type IbTX, IbTX-D19Y/Y36F or charybdotoxin (ChTX) result in complete inhibition of binding whereas toxins selective for voltage-gated K+ channels (margatoxin (MgTX) or alpha-dendrotoxin (alpha-DaTX) do not have any effect on IbTX binding. Indole diterpene alkaloids, which are selective inhibitors of maxi-K channels, and potassium ions both modulate [125I]IbTX-D19Y/Y36F binding in a complex manner. This pattern is also reflected during covalent incorporation of the radiolabeled toxin into the 31 kDa beta-subunit of the maxi-K channel in the presence of a bifunctional cross-linking reagent. In rat brain membranes, IbTX-D19Y/Y36F does not displace binding of [125I]MgTX or [125I]-alpha-DaTX to sites associated with voltage-gated K+ channels, nor do these latter toxins inhibit [125I]IbTX-D19Y/Y36F binding. Taken together, these results demonstrate that [125I]IbTX-D19Y/Y36F is the first selective radioligand for maxi-K channels with high specific activity.",

The phosphorylation of Tau is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A, which in turn is regulated by inhibitor 2, I2(PP2A). In acidic conditions such as generated by brain ischemia and hypoxia, especially in association with hyperglycemia as in diabetes, I2(PP2A) is cleaved by asparaginyl endopeptidase at Asn-175 into the N-terminal fragment (I2NTF) and the C-terminal fragment (I2CTF). Both I2NTF and I2CTF are known to bind to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and inhibit its activity. Here we show that the level of activated asparaginyl endopeptidase is significantly increased, and this enzyme and I2(PP2A) translocate, respectively, from neuronal lysosomes and nucleus to the cytoplasm where they interact and are associated with hyperphosphorylated Tau in Alzheimer disease brain. Asparaginyl endopeptidase from Alzheimer disease brain could cleave GST-I2(PP2A), except when I2(PP2A) was mutated at the cleavage site Asn-175 to Gln. Finally, an induction of acidosis by treatment with kainic acid or pH 6.0 medium activated asparaginyl endopeptidase and consequently produced the cleavage of I2(PP2A), inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, and hyperphosphorylation of Tau, and the knockdown of asparaginyl endopeptidase with siRNA abolished this pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest the involvement of brain acidosis in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and asparaginyl endopeptidase-I2(PP2A)-protein phosphatase 2A-Tau hyperphosphorylation pathway as a therapeutic target.",

Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with endotoxin induced the association of PU.1 and the TLR4 promoter in a time-dependent manner, and this was closely tied to interactions between the TLR4 promoter and the PIP interferon regulatory factors (IRF)4 and IRF8. PU.1 binding was related to increases in steady-state TLR4 mRNA and total TLR4 protein in RAW cells. Endotoxemia in animals caused the similar inducible interaction between PU.1 and IRF4 and the TLR4 promoter in lung tissue of mice that was treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin. PU.1 binding to the TLR4 promoter was not enhanced in the lung tissue of endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice in response to endotoxemia.

HEY1 acts as a positive regulator of the tumour suppressor p53 via still unknown mechanisms. A MALDI-TOF/TOF\u00a0MS analysis has uncovered a novel HEY1 regulatory phosphorylation event at Ser-68. Strikingly, this single phosphorylation event controls HEY1 stability and function: simulation of HEY1 Ser-68 phosphorylation increases HEY1 protein stability but inhibits its ability to enhance p53 transcriptional activity. Unlike wild-type HEY1, expression of the phosphomimetic mutant HEY1-S68D failed to induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and it did not sensitize U2OS cells to p53-activating chemotherapeutic drugs. We have identified two related kinases, STK38 (serine/threonine kinase 38) and STK38L (serine/threonine kinase 38 like), which interact with and phosphorylate HEY1 at Ser-68. HEY1 is phosphorylated at Ser-68 during mitosis and it accumulates in the centrosomes of mitotic cells, suggesting a possible integration of HEY1-dependent signalling in centrosome function. Moreover, HEY1 interacts with a subset of p53-activating ribosomal proteins. Ribosomal stress causes HEY1 relocalization from the nucleoplasm to perinucleolar structures termed nucleolar caps. HEY1 interacts physically with at least one of the ribosomal proteins, RPL11, and both proteins cooperate in the inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation resulting in a synergistic positive effect on p53 transcriptional activity. HEY1 itself also interacts directly with MDM2 and it is subjected to MDM2-mediated degradation. Simulation of HEY1 Ser-68 phosphorylation prevents its interaction with p53, RPL11 and MDM2 and abolishes HEY1 migration to nucleolar caps upon ribosomal stress. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism for cross-talk between Notch signalling and nucleolar stress.",

Till date, limited information is available for cytosol to nuclear shuttling of p53; except microtubule-based trafficking route, which utilizes minus-end directed motor dynein.

Histidine-tag pull-down assay using purified p53(1-393)-His and G-actin confirms direct physical association between p53 and monomeric G-actin. Co-immunoprecipitation data supports the same. Confocal imaging explores intense perinuclear colocalization between p53 and G-actin. To address atomistic details of the complex, constraint-based docked model of p53:G-actin complex was generated based on crystal structures. MD simulation reveals that p53 DNA-binding domain arrests very well the G-actin protein. Docking benchmark studies have been carried out for a known crystal structure, 1YCS (complex between p53DBD and BP2), which validates the docking protocol we adopted. Co-immunoprecipitation study using \"hot-spot\" p53 mutants suggested reduced G-actin association with cancer-associated p53 conformational mutants (R175H and R249S). Considering these findings, we hypothesized that point mutation in p53 structure, which diminishes p53:G-actin complexation results in mutant p53 altered subcellular localization.

Despite an identity of 87% of the amino acid sequences, both receptors show marked functional differences upon stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells: the mV(2)R displayed a 5-fold higher affinity for [(3)H]AVP than the human ortholog; similar differences were found for the AVP-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. Saturation binding experiments with transiently transfected intact COS.M6 cells showed that the mV(2)R was 3- to 5-fold less abundantly expressed at the cell surface than the hV(2)R. Laser scanning microscopy of fusion proteins consisting of the V(2)Rs and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (mV(2)R/GFP, hV(2)R/GFP) demonstrated that the hV(2)R/GFP was efficiently transported to the plasma membrane, whereas the mV(2)R/GFP was localized mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum. Chimeric hV(2)Rs, in which the first and/or second extracellular loop(s) were replaced by the corresponding loop(s) of the mV(2)R, revealed that the second extracellular loop accounts for the differences in ligand binding, but the first extracellular loop accounts for the reduced cell surface expression. The exchange of lysine 100 by aspartate in the first extracellular loop of hV(2)R was sufficient to reduce cell surface expression, which was accompanied by intracellular retention as observed in laser scanning microscopy analysis. Conversely, the exchange of aspartate 100 by lysine in the mV(2)R increased the cell surface expression and resulted in predominant plasma membrane localization. Thus, a single amino acid difference in the first extracellular loop between mV(2)R and hV(2)R determines the efficiency of cell surface expression.",

The primary membrane contains nonglycosylated proteins, appears as crescents in the cytoplasm, and delimits immature and mature intracellular virions. The secondary or wrapping membrane contains glycoproteins, is derived from virus-modified trans-Golgi or endosomal cisternae, forms a loose coat around some intracellular mature virions, and becomes the envelope of extracellular virions. Although the mode of formation of the wrapping membrane is partially understood, we know less about the primary membrane. Recent reports posit that the primary membrane originates from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). According to this model, viral primary membrane proteins are cotranslationally inserted into the ER and accumulate in the ERGIC. To test the ERGIC model, we employed Sar1(H79G), a dominant negative form of the Sar1 protein, which is an essential component of coatomer protein II (COPII)-mediated cargo transport from the ER to the ERGIC and other post-ER compartments. Overexpression of Sar1(H79G) by transfection or by a novel recombinant vaccinia virus with an inducible Sar1(H79G) gene resulted in retention of ERGIC 53 in the ER but did not interfere with localization of viral primary membrane proteins in factory regions or with formation of viral crescent membranes and infectious intracellular mature virions. Wrapping of intracellular mature virions and formation of extracellular virions did not occur, however, because some proteins that are essential for the secondary membrane were retained in the ER as a consequence of Sar1(H79G) overexpression. Our data argue against an essential role of COPII-mediated cargo transport and the ERGIC in the formation of the viral primary membrane. Instead, viral membranes may be derived directly from the ER or by a novel mechanism.",

Previous study has shown that the G60A mutation perturbs GTP-induced conformational changes of H-Ras. We found that the G60A mutation decreases GTPase activity of H-Ras without significantly affecting GTP/GDP binding. The reduction in GTPase activity is most dramatic in the presence of GAP or NF1. Interestingly, the G60A mutation does not appear to alter the affinity of H-Ras for GAP or NF1. The G60A mutation moderately reduces the binding of H-Ras to Raf-1 Ras binding domain; however, the binding of H-Ras to ralGDS Ras binding domain was more significantly affected by the same mutation. These results indicate that although GAP, NF1, Raf-1, and ralGDS all interact with H-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and they are able to compete against each other for binding to H-Ras, these factors share overlapping but not identical binding domains on H-Ras.

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) can amplify hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) vasculogenic activity through an NH(2)-terminal mTOR binding (TOS) motif. We hypothesized that this mechanism coordinates vasculogenesis with the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10/FGF-receptor2b/Spry2 regulator of airway branching. First, we tested if the HIF-1\u03b1 TOS motif participated in epithelial-mesenchymal vascular signaling. mTORC1 activation by insulin significantly amplified HIF-1\u03b1 activity at fetal Po(2) (23 mmHg) in human bronchial epithelium (16HBE14o-) and induced vascular traits (Flk1, sprouting) in cocultured human embryonic lung mesenchyme (HEL-12469). This enhanced activation of HIF-1\u03b1 by mTORC1 was abolished on expression of a HIF-1\u03b1 (F99A) TOS-mutant and also suppressed vascular differentiation of HEL-12469 cocultures. Next, we determined if vasculogenesis in fetal lung involved regulation of mTORC1 by the FGF-10/FGFR2b/Spry2 pathway. Fetal airway epithelium displayed distinct mTORC1 activity in situ, and its hyperactivation by TSC1(-/-) knockout induced widespread VEGF expression and disaggregation of Tie2-positive vascular bundles. FGF-10-coated beads grafted into fetal lung explants from Tie2-LacZ transgenic mice induced localized vascular differentiation in the peripheral mesenchyme. In rat fetal distal lung epithelial (FDLE) cells cultured at fetal Po(2), FGF-10 induced mTORC1 and amplified HIF-1\u03b1 activity and VEGF secretion without induction of ERK1/2. This was accompanied by the formation of a complex between Spry2, the cCBL ubiquitin ligase, and the mTOR repressor, TSC2, which abolished GTPase activity directed against Rheb, the G protein inducer of mTORC1. Thus, mTORC1 links HIF-1\u03b1-driven vasculogenesis with the FGF-10/FGFR2b/Spry2 airway branching periodicity regulator.",

To define the involvement of specific polar amino acids within residues 420-434, we studied in parallel synthetic protein S peptides and recombinant protein S variants containing the same amino acid replacements, K423E, E424K, Q427E and K429E. Synthetic peptide analogs of peptide PSP-420 (residues 420-434) were assayed for binding C4BP and as inhibitors of complex formation. The PSP-420 peptide and the analogous peptide with the substitution E424K, but not the peptides containing the substitutions K423E and K429E, were able to bind C4BP. Recombinant proteins with mutations of K423E, Q427E and K429E showed reduced affinity for C4BP compared to plasma protein S, recombinant wild type protein S, or E424K-protein S. These results suggest that Lys-423, Gln-427 and Lys-429 of protein S are important for normal binding to C4BP.

This suggests that both in the peptide PSP-420 and in protein S, Lys-423 and Lys-429 significantly contribute to binding to antibody LJ-56. These results demonstrate that protein S residues 423, 427 and 429, but not residue 424, are involved in binding to both the antibody LJ-56 and to C4BP. When peptides PSP 420 and SL-6 (residues 447-460) with carboxyterminal amide or carboxylate moieties were compared to their ability to inhibit C4BP-protein S complexation, PSP-420-amide was the most potent. This finding together with the other results described here supports the hypothesis that the residues 420 and 434 in protein S provides a major binding site for C4BP.",

Here, we show that ATM, an upstream activator of p53 after DNA damage, is essential for p53 centrosomal localization and is required for the activation of the postmitotic checkpoint after spindle disruption. In mitosis, p53 failed to associate with centrosomes in two ATM-deficient, ataxiatelangiectasia-derived cell lines. Wild-type ATM gene transfer reestablished the centrosomal localization of p53 in these cells. Furthermore, wild-type p53 protein, but not the p53-S15A mutant, not phosphorylatable by ATM, localized at centrosomes when expressed in p53-null K562 cells. Finally, Ser15 phosphorylation of endogenous p53 was detected at centrosomes upon treatment with phosphatase inhibitors, suggesting that a p53 dephosphorylation step at centrosome contributes to sustain the cell cycle program in cells with normal mitotic spindles. When dissociated from centrosomes by treatments with spindle inhibitors, p53 remained phosphorylated at Ser15. AT cells, which are unable to phosphorylate p53, did not undergo postmitotic proliferation arrest after nocodazole block and release. These data demonstrate that ATM is required for p53 localization at centrosome and support the existence of a surveillance mechanism for inhibiting DNA reduplication downstream of the spindle assembly checkpoint",

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), YAP, Src family tyrosine kinases, Shc, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-\u03b31 (PLC\u03b31) have all been implicated in MT transformation. Mutant dl1015, with deletion of residues 338 to 347 in the C-terminal region, has been an enigma, because the basis for its transformation defect has not been apparent. This work probes the dl1015 region of MT. Because the region is proline rich, the hypothesis that it targets Src homology domain 3 (SH3) domains was tested, but mutation of the putative SH3 binding motif did not affect transformation. During this work, two point mutants, W348R and E349K, were identified as transformation defective. Extensive analysis of the E349K mutant is described here. Similar to wild-type MT, the E349K mutant associates with PP2A, YAP, tyrosine kinases, Shc, PI3 kinase, and PLC\u03b31. The E349K mutant was examined to determine the mechanism for its transformation defect. Assays of cell localization and membrane targeting showed no obvious difference in localization. Src association was normal as assayed by in vitro kinase and MT phosphopeptide mapping. Shc activation was confirmed by its tyrosine phosphorylation. Association of type 1 PI3K with MT was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation, showing both PI3K subunits and in vitro activity. Nonetheless, expression of the mutants failed to lead to the activation of two known downstream targets of PI3K, Akt and Rac-1. Strikingly, despite normal association of the E349K mutant with PI3K, cells expressing the mutant failed to elevate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) in mutant-expressing cells. These results indicate a novel unsuspected aspect to PI3K control. IMPORTANCE: The gene coding for middle T antigen (MT) is the murine polyomavirus oncogene most responsible for tumor formation. Its study has a history of uncovering novel aspects of mammalian cell regulation. The importance of PI3K activity and tyrosine phosphorylation are two examples of insights coming from MT. This study describes new mutants unable to transform like the wild type that point to novel regulation of PI3K signaling. Previous mutants were defective in PI3K because they failed to bind the enzyme and bring the activity to the membrane. These mutants recruit PI3K activity like the wild type, but fail to elevate the cellular level of PIP3, the product used to signal downstream of PI3K. As a result, they fail to activate either Akt or Rac1, explaining the transformation defect.",

However, the compartmentalization of KDR in EC and the mechanisms regulating this process have not been well defined. Here, we demonstrate that KDR is present on the plasma membrane, on endosomes, and in the perinuclear region of EC and colocalizes with early endosomal antigen (EEA1), caveolin-1, and dynamin-2, a signal transducing GTPase involved in receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, we also observed that dynamin-2 coimmunoprecipitates with KDR and is required for EC signaling/survival. Interestingly, EC overexpressing a mutant form of dynamin deficient in GTP binding (K44A) caused a selective inhibition in KDR protein level and endosomal vesicle formation and induced cell cycle arrest by inducing p21. Taken together, our findings suggest that dynamin-2 regulates KDR expression and function and hence plays an important role in VPF/VEGF mediated angiogenesis.",

Moreover, Gcs1 and the Snc v-SNAREs colocalize to subcellular structures that correspond to the trans-Golgi and endosomal compartments.

We show that GFP-Snc1 recycling to the trans-Golgi is impaired in gcs1Delta cells and these COPI mutants.

Analysis revealed that this function is mediated by Bcl-2 family proteins: Cytoplasmic p53 binds Bcl-w, liberating Bax, which then binds ND5, a subunit of respiratory complex-I, thereby suppressing complex-I activity and thus ROS production. The G13289A mutation of ND5, identified in cancer patients, prevents Bax/ND5 interactions and promotes ROS production and cell invasion. We also showed that Bcl-XL and Bak can substitute for Bcl-w and Bax, respectively, regulating complex-I activity and supporting the cytoplasmic function of p53; nuclear p53 also suppresses complex-I activity by inducing Bax expression. Studies in animal models support the notion that p53 and Bcl-2 family proteins exhibit these functions in vivo. This study demonstrates a link between p53 and Bcl-2 proteins as regulators of ROS production and cellular invasiveness, and reveals complex-I, especially ND5, as their functional target.",

It has been assumed that T20 inhibits HIV-1 infection by binding to the trimer formed by the N-terminal helical region (HR1) of gp41, preventing the formation of a six helix bundle by the N- and C-terminal helical regions of gp41. In addition to binding to gp41, T20 was found to bind to gp120 of X4 viruses and this binding was suggested to be responsible for an alternative mechanism of HIV-1 inhibition by this peptide. In the present study, T20 also was found to bind R5 gp120. Using NMR spectroscopy, the segments of T20 that interact with both gp120 and a gp120/CD4M33 complex were mapped. A peptide corresponding to the fourth constant region of gp120, sC4, was found to partially recapitulate gp120 binding to T20 and the segment of this peptide interacting with T20 was mapped. The present study concludes that an amphiphilic helix on the T20 C-terminus binds through mostly hydrophobic interactions to a nonpolar gp120 surface formed primarily by the C4 region. The ten- to thousand-fold difference between the EC50 of T20 against viral fusion and the affinity of T20 to gp120 implies that binding to gp120 is not a major factor in T20 inhibition of HIV-1 fusion.

Since analysis of the signaling pathways used by kinase-defective receptors could reveal otherwise masked capabilities, we examined in detail the tyrosine phosphorylations and enzymes of the MAP kinase pathway induced by kinase-defective EGF receptors. Following EGF stimulation of B82L cells expressing a kinase-defective EGF receptor mutant (K721M), we found that ERK2 and ERK1 MAP kinases, as well as MEK1 and MEK2 were all activated, and SHC became prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated. By contrast, kinase-defective receptors failed to induce detectable phosphorylations of GAP (GTPase-activating protein), p62, JAK1, or p91STAT1, all of which were robustly phosphorylated by wild-type receptors. These data demonstrate that kinase-defective receptors induce several protein tyrosine phosphorylations, but that these represent only a subset of those seen with wild-type receptors. This suggests that kinase-defective receptors activate a heterologous tyrosine kinase with a specificity different from the EGF receptor. We found that kinase-defective receptors induced ErbB2/c-Neu enzymatic activation and ErbB2/c-Neu binding to SHC at a level even greater than that induced by wild-type receptors. Thus, heterodimerization with and activation of endogenous ErbB2/c-Neu is a possible mechanism by which kinase-defective receptors stimulate the MAP kinase pathway.",

We recently described an extranuclear mechanism of TH action that consists of the association of TH-liganded TRbeta with p85alpha [regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)] in the cytosol and subsequent activation of the PI3K, generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. This initiates the activation of a signaling cascade by phosphorylation of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its substrate p70(S6K), leading to the stimulation of ZAKI-4alpha synthesis, a calcineurin inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that this same mechanism leads to induction of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha), and its target genes, glucose transporter (GLUT)1, platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP), and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4. These genes are of special interest, because their products have important roles in cellular glucose metabolism, from glucose uptake (GLUT1) to glycolysis (PFKP) and lactate export (MCT4).

It also induces the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. These processes are believed to be important in KSHV-GPCR-related oncogenesis. We have characterized the signaling pathways mediated by KSHV-GPCR in a reconstituted 293T cell model in which the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) was ectopically expressed. RAFTK has been shown to play an important role in growth factor signaling in endothelium and in B cell antigen receptor signaling in B lymphocytes. KSHV-GPCR induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. Expression of wild-type RAFTK enhanced GPCR-mediated JNK/SAPK activation, whereas dominant-negative mutant constructs of RAFTK, such as K457A (which lacks kinase activity) and Y402F (a Src-binding mutant), inhibited KSHV-GPCR-mediated activation of JNK/SAPK. RAFTK also mediated the KSHV-GPCR-induced activation of Lyn, a Src family kinase. However, RAFTK did not mediate the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase induced by KSHV-GPCR. Human interferon gamma-inducible protein-10, which is known to inhibit KSHV-GPCR activity, was found to reduce RAFTK phosphorylation and JNK/SAPK activation. These results suggest that in cells expressing RAFTK/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, such as endothelial and B cells, RAFTK can act to enhance KSHV-GPCR-mediated downstream signaling to transcriptional regulators such as JNK/SAPK.",

These observations prompted us to analyze whether Dmp53 sumoylation at this site has any functional role in vivo. Genetic assays showed that deleting one copy of genes involved in sumoylation (lwr, Su(var)2-10 or smt3 heterozygosity) enhanced slightly the mutator phenotype of Dmp53. We compared the in vivo effects of wild type and K302R Dmp53 overproduced from transgenes and determined that similar levels of expression of the mutant and wild type proteins resulted in similar phenotype, and the two proteins showed similar cellular localization. The half life and the trans-activator activity of K302R mutant and wild type Dmp53 were also comparable. Lastly, by analyzing wild type and K302R Dmp53 expressed at different levels in animals and in S2 cells we detected no differences between the mobility of the mutant and wild-type protein. From these data we conclude that under normal developmental conditions the loss of SUMO modification at K302 does not affect Dmp53 function significantly.",

The replicative helicase of eukaryotic organisms is composed of the six paralogs MCM2-7, which form a heterohexameric ring structure. In contrast, the structure of the archaean replicative MCM helicase is a single Mcm protein that forms a homohexameric complex. Atomic structures of archaeal MCMs have identified multiple beta-finger structures in Mcm proteins whose in vivo function is unknown. In the present study, we have investigated the physiological role of the pre-sensor 1 beta-hairpin (PS1-hp) beta-fingers of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm4p and Mcm5p in DNA replication initiation and elongation in vivo. The PS1-hp beta-finger mutant of Mcm5p (mcm5-HAT K506A::URA3) has a growth defect at both 18\u00b0 and 37\u00b0. Mutation of the Mcm4p PS1-hp beta-finger (mcm4-HA K658A::TRP1) does not have a growth defect, indicating different functional contributions of the PS1-hp beta-finger structures of different MCM helicase subunits. Both Mcm4p and Mcm5p PS1-hp beta-finger mutants can coimmunoprecipitate Mcm2p, indicating the formation of the hexameric MCM helicase complex. Both PS1-hp beta-finger mutants have a plasmid loss phenotype that is suppressible by origin dosage, indicating a defective replication initiation. Surprisingly, a defect in the binding of PS1-hp MCM mutants to origins of DNA replication was not found by chromatin immunoprecipitation, suggesting a novel interpretation in which the defect is in a subsequent step of DNA strand separation by the MCM helicase.

Remarkably, bone marrow myeloid progenitors from Gab2 (-/-) mice are resistant to transformation by BCR/ABL, whereas lymphoid transformation is diminished as a consequence of markedly increased apoptosis.

          "text": "BACKGROUND: While protease-activated-receptor 1 (PAR(1)) plays a central role in tumor progression, little is known about the cell signaling involved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show here the impact of PAR(1) cellular activities using both an orthotopic mouse mammary xenograft and a colorectal-liver metastasis model in vivo, with biochemical analyses in vitro. Large and highly vascularized tumors were generated by cells over-expressing wt hPar1, Y397Z hPar1, with persistent signaling, or Y381A hPar1 mutant constructs. In contrast, cells over-expressing the truncated form of hPar1, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail, developed small or no tumors, similar to cells expressing empty vector or control untreated cells. Antibody array membranes revealed essential hPar1 partners including Etk/Bmx and Shc. PAR(1) activation induces Etk/Bmx and Shc binding to the receptor C-tail to form a complex. Y/A mutations in the PAR(1) C-tail did not prevent Shc-PAR(1) association, but enhanced the number of liver metastases compared with the already increased metastases obtained with wt hPar1. We found that Etk/Bmx first binds via the PH domain to a region of seven residues, located between C378-S384 in PAR(1) C-tail, enabling subsequent Shc association. Importantly, expression of the hPar1-7A mutant form (substituted A, residues 378-384), which is incapable of binding Etk/Bmx, resulted in inhibition of invasion through Matrigel-coated membranes. Similarly, knocking down Etk/Bmx inhibited PAR(1)-induced MDA-MB-435 cell migration. In addition, intact spheroid morphogenesis of MCF10A cells is markedly disrupted by the ectopic expression of wt hPar1. In contrast, the forced expression of the hPar1-7A mutant results in normal ball-shaped spheroids. Thus, by preventing binding of Etk/Bmx to PAR(1) -C-tail, hPar1 oncogenic properties are abrogated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first demonstration that a cytoplasmic portion of the PAR(1) C-tail functions as a scaffold site. We identify here essential signaling partners, determine the hierarchy of binding and provide a platform for therapeutic vehicles via definition of the critical PAR(1)-associating region in the breast cancer signaling niche.",

Expression and activation of IGF-IR, in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32Dcl.3 cells, prevents death under conditions of IL-3 withdrawal. In contrast, a chimeric receptor comprising the extracellular portion of IGF-IR fused to the cytoplasmic tail of IR (chIR) fails to promote cell survival when activated with ligand. Both chIR and IGF-IR exhibit comparable levels of enzymatic activity as evidenced by their ability to autophosphorylate and transphosphorylate the shc protein in vivo. Both chIR and IGF-IR can activate the MAPK signal transduction pathway; however, neither RTK is capable of promoting mitogenesis in the absence of IRS proteins. Structure function analysis of the IR cytoplasmic tail reveals that replacing the COOH-terminal 94 amino acids of the IR cytoplasmic tail with the comparable sequence from IGF-IR confers full antiapoptotic function. Furthermore, mutation of only two amino acids within IR, Phe-1264 and His-1265 to tyrosine (chIR/YY) is sufficient to impart a cell survival activity comparable to wild-type IGF-IR. Amino acid residues Phe-1264 and His-1265 of IR are in a region comparable to Tyr-1250 and Tyr-1251 within human IGF-IR. The amino acid sequence of IR from other species contains at least one tyrosine residue in this region, suggesting that differences in antiapoptotic function we observed may represent a characteristic unique to human members of this RTK family. The ability of IGF-IR or chIR/YY to prevent apoptosis is not blocked by addition of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. These studies define a critical region responsible for mediating cell survival through a novel interaction that is independent of mitogenesis.",

Using ER+/PR-B+ T47D breast cancer cells, we probed the role of progestin-stimulated rapid PR signaling in the transcriptional regulation of target genes involved in breast cancer cell proliferation. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was rapidly activated after a 10-min treatment with R5020. Progestin induced EGFR-, c-Src-, and MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of PR-B on the MAPK consensus site, Ser345. Ser345-phosphorylated PR-B receptors strongly associated with specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factors to regulate PR cell cycle (p21) and growth-promoting (EGFR) target genes whose promoters lack canonical progesterone response element sequences. Inhibitors of EGFR, c-Src, or MAPK activities blocked PR tethering to Sp1 and progestin-stimulated S-phase entry. Mutant PR-B receptors defective for c-Src binding (mPro) were not phosphorylated on Ser345 in response to progestin and failed to interact with Sp1. Hormone-induced complexes containing Sp1 and wild-type PR-B, but not S345A or mPro PR-B, were recruited to Sp1 sites within the endogenous p21 promoter. Progestin-induced S-phase entry was attenuated in T47D cells containing wild-type PR-B and treated with EGFR, c-Src, or MAPK kinase inhibitors or in T47D cells stably expressing mPro or mutant DNA-binding domain PR-B. In sum, rapid progestin-activated PR signaling leads to PR Ser345 phosphorylation and tethering to Sp1. These events are critical for progestin-stimulated regulation of Sp1 target genes and breast cancer cell proliferation. Our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential for PR-targeted breast cancer treatment by exploiting multiple nodes along the PR signaling pathway, including PR-B, EGFR, c-Src, MAPK, or Sp1.",

Although the MIT domains of CAPN7 were previously shown to interact with a subset of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins, including charged multivesicular body protein 1 and increased sodium tolerance (IST)1, knowledge of the involvement of the protease in membrane trafficking has been limited. In the present study, compared with control cells, we found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation was mildly delayed in CAPN7-knockdown HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells established from CAPN7 knockout (Capn7(-/-) ) mice. Re-expression of wild-type CAPN7 but not a protease-inactive mutant of CAPN7 (CAPN7(C290S) ) resulted in a recovery of the rate of EGFR degradation. We found, by immunofluorescence microscopic analysis, that monomeric GFP fused with the protease-inactive mutant of CAPN7 [monomeric green fluorescent protein (mGFP)-CAPN7(C290S) ] was mobilized to EGFR-positive endosomes upon epidermal growth factor stimulation in HeLa cells. Although mGFP-CAPN7(C290S) exhibited dominant-negative effects on EGFR degradation, a deletion mutant of MIT domains in mGFP-CAPN7(C290S) did not have such properties, suggesting that the interaction between the MIT domains and ESCRT proteins is important for the function of CAPN7. Moreover, we found that epidermal growth factor stimulation induces translocation of IST1 from the cytosol to endosomes positive in both EGFR and mGFP-CAPN7(C290S) . When IST1 was knocked down, mGFP-CAPN7(C290S) lost its co-localization with EGFR. These results demonstrate for the first time that the proteolytic activity of CAPN7 is important for the acceleration of EGFR degradation via the endosomal sorting pathway utilizing a part of the ESCRT system.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which overexpression of Cas confers resistance to tamoxifen. Cas overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells was shown to alleviate both tamoxifen-mediated growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. This enhancement of cell proliferation/survival occurred in the absence of detectable effects on estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional activity under conditions where tamoxifen was present, indicating that Cas-dependent tamoxifen resistance is not the result of a switch to an ER-negative phenotype or enhanced responses to the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen. Instead, we present evidence, suggesting that Cas promotes tamoxifen resistance by deregulation of alternative cell proliferation pathways, particularly those mediated through enhanced c-Src protein tyrosine kinase activity arising from Cas/c-Src interactions. Overexpression of Cas was found to drive endogenous c-Src into complex with Cas, a process that has been shown previously to cause up-regulation of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity. MCF-7 cells overexpressing Cas exhibited increased phosphorylation of two c-Src substrates, Tyr845 in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5b. Importantly, Cas-dependent protection from the antiproliferative effects of tamoxifen was reversed by the expression of dominant inhibitory variants of these substrates (Y845F EGFR and COOH-terminally truncated STAT5b). Based on these findings, we suggest that the Cas/c-Src/EGFR/STAT5 signaling axis is a major regulator of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell growth and survival.",

Peptide incorporation into kinase inhibited light chain phosphorylation, and the loss of kinase activity was proportional to the extent of peptide incorporated. After peptide I was incorporated into myosin light chain kinase, it was partially phosphorylated in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin. The extent of phosphorylation increased in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin. The cross-linked photoadduct was digested, labeled peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and sites of covalent modification were determined by amino acid sequencing and analysis. The covalent modification in the catalytic core occurred on Ile-373 (66%) and in a peptide containing residues Asn-422 to Met-437 (14%), respectively. Lys-572 in the autoinhibitory region accounted for 20% of the incorporated label. The coincident covalent modification of the autoinhibitory domain suggests that it is located near the catalytic site. Based upon a model of the catalytic core, the substrate peptide is predicted to bind in the cleft between the two lobes of the kinase.

Using a series of biological and biochemical analyses of wild-type and site-directed mutant receptors, we identified Asn(205) as a potential interacting partner with the Tyr(266) residue. An N205H/Y266H double mutant showed pH-dependent functional activity, whereas the N205H receptor was non-functional and the Y266H receptor was partially active indicating that the histidine 205 and 266 residues interact in an activated state of the receptor. The introduction of N205K or Y266D mutations into the P258L/S259L constitutively active receptor suppressed the constitutive activity; in contrast, the N205K/Y266D/P258L/S259L quadruple mutant was fully constitutively active, again indicating an interaction between residues at the 205 and 206 positions in the receptor-active state. To further test this interaction, we introduced the N205C/Y266C, F204C/Y266C, and N205C/A265C double mutations into wild-type and P258L/S259L constitutively active receptors. After trypsin digestion, we found that a disulfide-cross-linked product, with the molecular weight expected for a receptor fragment with a cross-link between N205C and Y266C, formed only in the N205C/Y266C constitutively activated receptor. This study represents the first experimental demonstration of an interaction between specific residues in an active state, but not the resting state, of Ste2p. The information gained from this study should contribute to an understanding of the conformational differences between resting and active states in GPCRs.",

Analysis of cysteine (Cys) to serine (Ser) substitution mutants of NM23-H1 (C4S, C109S, and C145S) and MIF (C57S, C60S, and C81S) revealed that Cys(145) of NM23-H1 and Cys(60) of MIF are responsible for complex formation.

NM23-H1 alleviated the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by promoting the dissociation of MIF from MIF-p53 complexes. In addition, NM23-H1 significantly inhibited the MIF-induced proliferation of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells through a direct interaction with MIF, and decreased the MIF-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PDK1 and p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase.

RAS2-E130K protein, on the other hand, differed from the wild type protein with a fast GDP dissociation rate and 2-fold higher activation of adenylate cyclase. When the sensitivity to GTPase-activating protein (GAP) was examined, we found that the RAS2-E99K protein was approximately 1200-fold less sensitive to NF1-GAP activity. In addition, the affinity for NF1 as revealed by competition binding experiments was reduced more than 150-fold with RAS2-E99K protein. Thus, the RAS2-E99K mutation affects interaction with GAP proteins. This mutation is particularly interesting because it is the first mutation identified in the alpha 3 region of ras protein that affects GAP interaction. The alpha 3 region appears to be directly involved in interaction with NF1, since peptides containing the sequence encompassing residue 99 of RAS2 inhibit NF1-GAP activity.

Using recombinant proteins, we found uPAR directly binds alpha5beta1 and rather than blocking, renders fibronectin (Fn) binding by alpha5beta1 Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) resistant. This resulted from RGD-independent binding of alpha5beta1-uPAR to Fn type III repeats 12-15 in addition to type III repeats 9-11 bound by alpha5beta1. Suppression of endogenous uPAR by small interfering RNA in tumor cells promoted weaker, RGD-sensitive Fn adhesion and altered overall alpha5beta1 conformation. A beta1 peptide (res 224NLDSPEGGF232) that models near the known alpha-chain uPAR-binding region, or a beta1-chain Ser227Ala point mutation, abrogated effects of uPAR on alpha5beta1.

Although NAIP protein is known to have an anti-apoptotic function, the function of SMN has been unclear and it shows no significant sequence similarity to any other protein. The SMN gene is deleted or interrupted on both chromosomes in nearly all SMA patients. Here we show that SMN interacts with Bcl-2, another anti-apoptotic protein, and that co-expression of SMN with Bcl-2 confers a synergistic preventive effect against Bax-induced or Fas-mediated apoptosis, although SMN itself has only a weak anti-apoptotic activity. SMN(Y272C), which carries a missense mutation and was found in an SMA patient who exceptionally retained SMN on one allele, exerts no synergism with Bcl-2. Furthermore, the product of a truncated transcript lacking exon 7, which was derived from an SMN gene carrying an intragenic mutation or from the SMN copy gene cBCD541 retained in all SMA patients, had no synergistic activity but instead had a dominant-negative effect on full-length SMN.

In the present study, we have identified a specific tyrosine residue within paxillin, tyrosine 118 (Tyr-118), that represents the principle site of phosphorylation by FAK in vitro. The identification of this site as a target for FAK phosphorylation was accomplished by immunoprecipitating FAK and performing in vitro kinase assays, using as substrate either glutathione S-transferase (GST)-paxillin fusion proteins containing truncations in paxillin sequence or fusion proteins with phenylalanine substitutions for tyrosine residues. GST-paxillin containing a phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-118 (Y118F) was not phosphorylated by FAK immunoprecipitates; however, this mutant was shown to bind FAK equally as well as the wild type fusion protein. As a first step toward assessing the function of paxillin phosphorylation on Tyr-118, a Y118F paxillin cDNA construct was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Similar to wild type paxillin, mutated paxillin localized to focal adhesions, indicating that the phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr-118 is not essential for the recruitment of paxillin to sites of cell adhesion.",

Previous studies have identified positions in the third and fourth membrane-associated (M) domains of the NMDA receptor GluN1 and GluN2A subunits that influence alcohol sensitivity. The predicted structure of the NMDA receptor, based on that of the related GluA2 subunit, indicates a close apposition of the alcohol-sensitive positions in M3 and M4 between the two subunit types. We tested the hypothesis that these positions interact to regulate receptor kinetics and ethanol sensitivity by using dual substitution mutants. In single-substitution mutants, we found that a position in both subunits adjacent to one previously identified, GluN1(Gly-638) and GluN2A(Phe-636), can strongly regulate ethanol sensitivity. Significant interactions affecting ethanol inhibition and receptor deactivation were observed at four pairs of positions in GluN1/GluN2A: Gly-638/Met-823, Phe-639/Leu-824, Met-818/Phe-636, and Leu-819/Phe-637; the latter pair also interacted with respect to desensitization. Two interactions involved a position in M4 of both subunits, GluN1(Met-818) and GluN2A(Leu-824), that does not by itself alter ethanol sensitivity, whereas a previously identified ethanol-sensitive position, GluN2A(Ala-825), did not unequivocally interact with any other position tested. These results also indicate a shift by one position of the predicted alignment of the GluN1 M4 domain. These findings have allowed for the refinement of the NMDA receptor M domain structure, demonstrate that this region can influence apparent agonist affinity, and support the existence of four sites of alcohol action on the NMDA receptor, each consisting of five amino acids at the M3-M4 domain intersubunit interfaces.",

To investigate the possible functional role of the lipid-embedded lysine in the mouse integrin beta1 subunit, this amino acid was replaced with leucine, and the mutated beta1 subunit (beta1A(K756L)) was stably expressed in beta1-deficient GD25 cells. The extracellular domain of beta1A(K756L) integrins possesses a competent conformation for ligand binding as determined by the ability to mediate cell adhesion, and by the presence of the monoclonal antibody 9EG7 epitope. However, the spreading of GD25-beta1A(K756L) cells on fibronectin and laminin-1 was impaired, and the rate of migration of GD25-beta1A(K756L) cells on fibronectin was reduced compared with GD25-beta1A cells. Phosphorylation of tyrosines in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the Y416 in c-Src in response to beta1A(K756L)-mediated adhesion was similar to that induced by wild-type beta1. The tyrosine phosphorylation level of paxillin, a downstream target of FAK/Src, was unaffected by the beta1 mutation, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of CAS was strongly reduced. The results demonstrate that CAS is a target for phosphorylation both by FAK-dependent and -independent pathways after integrin ligation. The latter pathway was inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002, implicating that it required an active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Furthermore, the K756L mutation in the beta1 subunit was found to interfere with beta1-induced activation of Akt. The results from this study identify phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as an early component of a FAK-independent integrin signaling pathway triggered by the membrane proximal part of the beta1 subunit.",

To investigate the structural determinants of ligand binding specificity, we examined the extracellular domain of human (h) RAMP1 using various deletion mutants. Co-expression of the hRAMP1 mutants with hCRLR in HEK-293 cells revealed that deletion of residues 91-94, 96-100, or 101-103 blocked [125I]CGRP binding and completely abolished intracellular cAMP accumulation normally elicited by CGRP or AM. On the other hand, the deletion of residues 78-80 or 88-90 significantly attenuated only AM-evoked responses. In all of these cases, the receptor heterodimers were fully expressed at the cell surface. Substituting alanine for residues 91-103 one at a time had little effect on CGRP-induced responses, indicating that although this segment is essential for high affinity agonist binding to the receptors, none of the residues directly interacts with either CGRP or AM. This finding suggests that RAMPs probably determine ligand specificity by contributing to the structure of the ligand-binding pocket or by allosteric modulation of the conformation of the receptor. Interestingly, the L94A mutant up-regulated surface expression of the receptor heterodimer to a greater degree than wild-type hRAMP1, thereby increasing CGRP binding and signaling. L94A also significantly increased cell surface expression of the hRAMP1 deletion mutant D101-103 when co-transfected with hCRLR, and expression of a L94A/D101-103 double mutant markedly attenuated the activity of endogenous RAMP1 in HEK-293T cells.",

Cyclin D1 protein is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclin D1 ubiquitination is dependent on its phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) on threonine 286 and that this phosphorylation event is greatly enhanced by binding to CDK4 (Diehl, J. A., Cheng, M. G., Roussel, M. F., and Sherr, C. J. (1998) Genes Dev. 12, 3499-3511). We now report an additional pathway for the ubiquitination of free cyclin D1 (unbound to CDKs). We show that, when unbound to CDK4, a cyclin D1-T286A mutant is ubiquitinated. Further, we show that a mutant of cyclin D1 that cannot bind to CDK4 (cyclin D1-KE) is also ubiquitinated in vivo. Our results demonstrate that free cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of its phosphorylation on threonine 286 by GSK-3beta, suggesting that, as has been shown for cyclin E, distinct pathways of ubiquitination lead to the degradation of free and CDK-bound cyclin D1.

In these malignant gliomas as well as in GBM cell lines, we found Notch2 protein to be strongly expressed. In a GBM tumor tissue microarray, RBPJk protein, a Notch2 cofactor for transcription, was found to be significantly coexpressed with TNC. We show that the TNC gene is transactivated by Notch2 in an RBPJk-dependent manner mediated by an RBPJk binding element in the TNC promoter. The transactivation is abrogated by a Notch2 mutation, which we detected in the glioma cell line Hs683 that does not express TNC. This L1711M mutation resides in the RAM domain, the site of interaction between Notch2 and RBPJk. In addition, transfection of constructs encoding activated Notch2 or Notch1 increased endogenous TNC expression identifying TNC as a novel Notch target gene. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of the transcriptional coactivator MAML1 or knocking down RBPJk in LN319 cells led to a dramatic decrease in TNC protein levels accompanied by a significant reduction of cell migration. Because addition of purified TNC stimulated glioma cell migration, this represents a mechanism for the invasive properties of glioma cells controlled by Notch signaling and defines a novel oncogenic pathway in gliomagenesis that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention in GBM patients.",

          "text": "BACKGROUND: PTEN is the second most mutated tumor suppressor gene other than p53. It suppresses tumorigenesis by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2), thereby directly inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated tumorigenic activities. Consistent with this model of action, cytosolic PTEN is recruited to the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate PIP3. While nuclear PTEN has been shown to suppress tumorigenesis by governing genome integrity, additional mechanisms may also contribute to nuclear PTEN-mediated tumor suppression. The nuclear protein BMI1 promotes stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis and PTEN inhibits these events, suggesting that PTEN may suppress BMI1 function. RESULTS: We investigated whether PTEN inhibits BMI1 function during prostate tumorigenesis. PTEN binds to BMI1 exclusively in the nucleus. This interaction does not require PTEN's phosphatase activity, as phosphatase-deficient PTEN mutants, PTEN/C124S (CS), PTEN/G129E (GE), and a C-terminal PTEN fragment (C-PTEN) excluding the catalytic domain, all associate with BMI1. Furthermore, the residues 186-286 of C-PTEN are sufficient for binding to BMI1. This interaction reduces BMI1's function. BMI1 enhances hTERT activity and reduces p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) expression. These effects were attenuated by PTEN, PTEN(CS), PTEN(GE), and C-PTEN. Furthermore, knockdown of PTEN in DU145 cells increased hTERT promoter activity, which was reversed when BMI1 was concomitantly knocked-down, indicating that PTEN reduces hTERT promoter activity via inhibiting BMI1 function. Conversely, BMI1 reduces PTEN's ability to inhibit AKT activation, which can be attributed to its interaction with PTEN in the nucleus, making PTEN unavailable to dephosphorylate membrane-bound PIP3. Furthermore, BMI1 appears to co-localize with PTEN more frequently in clinical prostate tissue samples from patients diagnosed with PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and carcinoma compared to normal prostate epithelium. While PTEN co-localized with BMI1 in 2.4% of normal prostate epithelial cells, co-localization was observed in 37.6% and 18.5% of cells in PIN and carcinoma, respectively. Collectively, we demonstrate that PTEN inhibits BMI1 function via binding to BMI1 in a phosphatase independent manner. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that nuclear PTEN reduces BMI1 function independently of its phosphatase activity. It was recently observed that nuclear PTEN also suppresses tumorigenesis. Our results, therefore, provide a plausible mechanism by which nuclear PTEN prevents tumorigenesis.",

          "text": "The small GTP-binding protein ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) has recently been implicated in the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), although its precise molecular mechanism in this process remains unclear. We have recently identified centaurin alpha(1) as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for ARF6. In the current study, we characterized the effects of centaurin alpha(1) on the agonist-induced internalization of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as confocal imaging of cells, we found that expression of centaurin alpha(1) strongly inhibited the isoproterenol-induced internalization of beta(2)-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, expression of functionally inactive versions of centaurin alpha(1), including an R49C mutant, which has no catalytic activity, and a double pleckstrin homology (PH) mutant (DM; R148C/R273C), which has mutations in both the PH domains of centaurin alpha(1), rendering it unable to translocate to the cell membrane, were unable to inhibit beta(2)-adrenoceptor internalization. In addition, a constitutively active version of ARF6, ARF6Q67L, reversed the ability of centaurin alpha(1) to inhibit beta(2)-adrenoceptor internalization. Finally, expression of centaurin alpha(1) also inhibited the agonist-induced internalization of beta(2)-adrenoceptor endogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells, whereas the R49C and DM mutant versions of centaurin alpha(1) had no effect. Together, these data indicate that by acting as an ARF6 GAP, centaurin alpha(1) is able to switch off ARF6 and so inhibit its ability to mediate beta(2)-adrenoceptor internalization. Thus, ARF6 GAPs, such as centaurin alpha(1), are likely to play a crucial role in GPCR trafficking by modulating the activity of ARF6.",

This activity requires the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, which is recruited to the activated VEGFR-2 when cells are plated on collagen I, but not on vitronectin. Constitutive expression of SHP2(C459S) mutant inhibits the negative role of collagen I on VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. VEGFR-2 undergoes internalisation, which is associated with dynamin II phosphorylation. Expression of SHP2(C459S) impairs receptor internalisation suggesting that SHP2-dependent dephosphorylation regulates this process. These findings demonstrate that collagen I in provisional extracellular matrix surrounding nascent capillaries triggers a signaling pathway that negatively regulates angiogenesis.",

          "text": "The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) is a major regulator of cell-cycle progression and cellular differentiation. Central to pRB function is the pocket domain, which serves as the main binding region for cellular regulators. In tumors pRB is frequently inactivated by mutations in the pocket domain or by binding of viral oncoproteins to this region. A characteristic feature of these viral oncoproteins and many cellular pRB-binding partners is an LxCxE sequence motif, which interacts with pRB's pocket domain. Here, we show that the ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO is covalently attached to a distinct residue (K720) of pRB within the B-box of the pocket region that binds LxCxE-motif proteins. We provide evidence that SUMO preferentially targets the active, hypophosphorylated form of pRB and show that tumorigenic mutations of pRB in the pocket domain lead to a loss of SUMOylation. Notably, the level of pRB SUMOylation is controlled by the interaction of pRB with viral and cellular LxCxE-motif proteins. Inhibitors of pRB function, including the viral oncoproteins E1A and E7 and the cellular E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation EID-1, completely abolish SUMO modification of pRB. Conversely, pRB mutants deficient in binding of LxCxE-motif proteins exhibit a drastically enhanced modification by SUMO. Finally, we provide evidence that SUMOylation can influence pRB function, as the SUMO-deficient pRB(K720R) mutant exerts a slightly higher repressive potential on an E2F-responsive reporter gene than wild-type pRB. Taken together, these data identify SUMO modification as a novel post-translational modification of pRB that may control pRB activity by modulating LxCxE-pocket interactions.",

P53 may downregulate HR through multiple mechanisms including the reported associations with the Rad51 and Rad54 recombinases, and the BLM and WRN helicases. Here, we investigated whether the interaction of p53 with human replication protein A (RPA) is necessary for the regulation of HR. By employing a plasmid-based HR assay in p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells, we studied the HR-suppressing properties of a panel of p53 mutants, which varied in their ability to interact with RPA. Both wild-type p53 and a transactivation-deficient p53 mutant (L22Q/W23S) suppressed HR and prevented RPA binding to ssDNA in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, p53 mutations that specifically disrupt the RPA-binding domain, while not compromising p53 transactivation function (D48H/D49H and W53S/F54S), did not affect HR. Suppression of HR was also not seen with missense mutations in the p53 core domain (His175 and His273), which retained the ability to interact with RPA, suggesting that the disruption of additional binding interactions of p53, for example, with Rad51 or recombination intermediates, also impacts on HR. We hypothesize that sequestration of RPA by p53 at the sites of recombination is one means by which p53 can inhibit HR processes. Our data support and extend the previously formulated 'dual model' of p53's role as guardian of the genome.",

The cGMP-binding sites of one of these phosphodiesterases, the cGMP-binding cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cGB-PDE, PDE5), have been analysed by using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations that affect cGMP binding to either one or both allosteric sites do not influence cGMP hydrolysis in the catalytic site under the conditions used. However, compared with wild-type enzyme, the D289A, D478A and D289A/D478A mutants, which are defective in cGMP binding to either site a or site b, or both allosteric sites, require much higher cGMP concentrations for the allosteric stimulation of phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The cGMP effect is on the cGB-PDE rather than on the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase because the latter enzyme does not require cGMP for activity. The D289N mutant, which has higher binding affinity for cGMP than does the wild-type enzyme, is phosphorylated at lower concentrations of cGMP than is the wild-type enzyme. It is concluded that cGMP binding to the allosteric sites of cGB-PDE does not directly affect catalysis, but binding to both of these sites regulates phosphorylation of this enzyme.",

PC2 acts as a nonselective cation channel and together with PC1 plays a role in intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we have shown previously that the N and C termini of PC1 appear as unequally sized particles connected by a \"string\" largely composed of tandem immunoglobulin-like, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains. Here, we show that coexpression of PC1 and PC2 causes an elongation of the PC1 string and a corresponding reduction in the size of the larger (C-terminal) particle. This change in the conformation of PC1 does not depend on its delivery to the plasma membrane. In addition, the use of the L3040H PC1 mutant showed that the conformational change does not require GPS cleavage. Coexpression of PC1 with PC2 mutants revealed that the conformational change in PC1 does not require either a stable interaction between PC1 and PC2 or PC2 channel function. Finally, we show that the tandem PKD repeats and to a lesser extent the receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain both contribute to the extension of the PC1 string in the presence of PC2. We propose that the PKD repeats detach from the C-terminal fragment in response to PC2 activity. The resulting remodeling of PC1 may be responsible for enhancing GPS cleavage of PC1 and the separation of the PC1 N-terminal fragment from the C terminus during its maturation.",

Integrin adhesiveness for the extracellular matrix is activated by the cytoskeletal protein talin via direct binding of its phosphotyrosine-binding-like F3 domain to the cytoplasmic tail of the beta integrin subunit. The phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the signaling protein Dok1, on the other hand, has an inactivating effect on integrins, a phenomenon that is modulated by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Using full-length tyrosine-phosphorylated (15)N-labeled beta3, beta1A, and beta7 integrin tails and an NMR-based protein-protein interaction assay, we show that talin1 binds to the NPXY motif and the membrane-proximal portion of beta3, beta1A, and beta7 tails, and that the affinity of this interaction is decreased by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Dok1 only interacts weakly with unphosphorylated tails, but its affinity is greatly increased by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. The Dok1 interaction remains restricted to the integrin NPXY region, thus phosphorylation inhibits integrin activation by increasing the affinity of beta integrin tails for a talin competitor that does not form activating membrane-proximal interactions with the integrin. Key residues governing these specificities were identified by detailed structural analysis, and talin1 was engineered to bind preferentially to phosphorylated integrins by introducing the mutation D372R. As predicted, this mutation affects talin1 localization in live cells in an integrin phosphorylation-specific manner. Together, these results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is a common mechanism for regulating integrin activation, despite subtle differences in how these integrins interact with their binding proteins.",

The monomeric conformation binds and activates the receptor XCR1, whereas the dimer binds extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans and has been associated with anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. Functional studies of WT-XCL1 are complex, as both conformations are populated in solution. To overcome this limitation, we engineered a stabilized dimeric variant of XCL1 designated CC5. This variant features a new disulfide bond (A36C-A49C) that prevents structural interconversion by locking the chemokine into the \u03b2-sandwich dimeric conformation, as demonstrated by NMR structural analysis and hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments. Functional studies analyzing glycosaminoglycan binding demonstrate that CC5 binds with high affinity to heparin. In addition, CC5 exhibits potent inhibition of HIV-1 activity in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), demonstrating the importance of the dimer in blocking viral infection. Conformational variants like CC5 are valuable tools for elucidating the biological relevance of the XCL1 native-state interconversion and will assist in future antiviral and functional studies.",

We investigated the physiological importance of these interactions by mutating 16 segments spanning the NIP1-NTD. Mutations in multiple segments reduced the binding of eIF1 or eIF5 to the NIP1-NTD. Mutating a C-terminal segment of the NIP1-NTD increased utilization of UUG start codons (Sui(-) phenotype) and was lethal in cells expressing eIF5-G31R that is hyperactive in stimulating GTP hydrolysis by the TC at AUG codons. Both effects of this NIP1 mutation were suppressed by eIF1 overexpression, as was the Sui(-) phenotype conferred by eIF5-G31R. Mutations in two N-terminal segments of the NIP1-NTD suppressed the Sui(-) phenotypes produced by the eIF1-D83G and eIF5-G31R mutations. From these and other findings, we propose that the NIP1-NTD coordinates an interaction between eIF1 and eIF5 that inhibits GTP hydrolysis at non-AUG codons. Two NIP1-NTD mutations were found to derepress GCN4 translation in a manner suppressed by overexpressing the TC, indicating that MFC formation stimulates TC recruitment to 40S ribosomes. Thus, the NIP1-NTD is required for efficient assembly of preinitiation complexes and also regulates the selection of AUG start codons in vivo.",

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that tBID-tBID interactions occur in the mitochondria of living cells. Cross-linking experiments using a tBID-GST chimera indicated that tBID forms homotrimers in the mitochondrial membrane. To test the functional consequence of tBID oligomerization, we expressed a chimeric FKBP-tBID molecule. Enforced dimerization of FKBP-tBID by the bivalent ligand FK1012 resulted in Cyt c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Surprisingly, enforced dimerization of tBID did not result in the dimerization of either BAX or BAK. Moreover, a tBID BH3 mutant (G94E), which does not interact with or induce the dimerization of either BAX or BAK, formed the 45-kDa complex and induced both Cyt c release and apoptosis.

The molecular mechanisms that give rise to this complex phenotype have been linked to the occurrence of G beta 3s, a splice variant of GNB3. G beta 3s is predominantly expressed in cells with the 825T-allele. In the present study we describe the identification and characterization of an additional G beta 3 splice variant referred to as G beta 3s2. Its mRNA is expressed in heart, blood cells and tumour tissue, and its expression is also tightly associated with the GNB3 825T-allele. G beta 3s2 is generated by alternative splicing using non-canonical splice sites. G beta subunits belong to the family of propeller proteins and consist of seven regular propeller blades. Transcripts for G beta 3s2 are lacking 129 bp of the coding sequence of the wild-type G beta 3 protein. Thus the predicted structure consists of only six propeller blades, which resembles the structure of G beta 3s. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that G beta 3s2 dimerizes with different G gamma subunits, e.g. G gamma 5, G gamma 8(C) and G gamma 12. In Sf9 insect cells, expression of G beta 3s2 together with G gamma 12 enhances receptor-stimulated activation of G alpha(i2). Expression of G beta 3s2 in mammalian cells activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Together, these results suggest that G beta 3s2 is a biologically active G beta variant which may play a role in the manifestation of the complex phenotype associated with the 825T-allele.",

The complex formation between these analogues and receptor extracellular domains (R-ECD) of various hormones was determined by gel filtration. Wild type bPL yielded 1:2 complex with hGHR-ECD, rat PRLR-ECD, and rbPRLR-ECD, whereas both analogues formed only 1:1 complexes with all R-ECDs tested. Real time kinetics experiments demonstrated that the ability of the analogues to form homodimeric complexes was compromised in both PRLR- and GHR-ECDs. The biological activity transduced through lactogenic receptors in in vitro bioassays in rabbit mammary gland acini culture and in Nb2 cells was almost fully retained, whereas the activity transduced through somatogenic receptors in FDC-P1 cells transfected with rbGHRs or with hGHRs was abolished. Both analogues exhibited antagonistic activity in the latter cells. To explain the discrepancy between the effect of the mutation on the signal transduced by PLR versus GHRs we suggest that: 1) the mutation impairs the ability of site 2 of bPL to form a stable homodimeric complex with both lactogenic and somatogenic receptors by a drastic shortening of the half-life of 2:1 complex; 2) the transient existence of the homodimeric complex is still sufficient to initiate the signal transduced through lactogenic receptors but not through somatogenic receptors; and 3) one possible reason for this difference is that JAK2, which serves as a mediator of both receptors, is already associated with lactogenic receptors prior to hormone binding-induced receptor dimerization, whereas in somatogenic receptors the JAK2 receptor association occurs subsequently to receptor dimerization.",

Several in vitro studies have shown that the most frequent mutation, LRRK2(G2019S), increases kinase activity and impairs neuronal survival. LRRK2 has been linked to the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family and the receptor-interacting protein kinases based on sequence similarity within the kinase domain and in vitro substrate phosphorylation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used an unbiased proteomic approach to identify the kinase signaling pathways wherein LRRK2 may be active. By incubation of protein microarrays containing 260 signal transduction proteins we detected four arrayed Ste20 serine/threonine kinase family members (TAOK3, STK3, STK24, STK25) as novel LRRK2 substrates and LRRK2 interacting proteins, respectively. Moreover, we found that protein kinase C (PKC) zeta binds and phosphorylates LRRK2 both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ste20 kinases and PKC zeta contribute to neuronal Tau phosphorylation, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity under physiological conditions. Our data suggest that these kinases may also be involved in synaptic dysfunction and neurite fragmentation in transgenic mice and in human PD patients carrying toxic gain-of-function LRRK2 mutations.",

Introduction of a factor Xa cleavage site in the fusion protein allowed purification of TRE after removal from the GST carrier protein. Purified GST-TRE or TRE have been tested in solution for their ability to interact with thrombin. alpha-Thrombin cleaved the fusion protein at position Arg-41-Ser-42 of TRE in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and GST-TRE competed with the tripeptidic substrate S-2238 for hydrolysis by thrombin (Ki = 0.5 microM). gamma-Thrombin that lacks the anion-binding exosite was 100-fold less potent than alpha-thrombin at cleaving GST-TRE. TRE competed with polymerizing fibrin monomers for binding to thrombin (Ki = 7.5 microM). The cleavage of GST-TRE by alpha-thrombin was inhibited by several alpha-thrombin exosite ligands such as the C-terminal peptide of hirudin, thrombomodulin and fibrin(ogen) fragment E. In contrast, platelet glycocalicin did not inhibit GST-TRE cleavage. In conclusion, the use of purified soluble GST-TRE allowed us to derive an affinity constant for thrombin interaction with the N-terminal domain of the receptor and to confirm the location of the cleavage site at Arg41-Ser-42 of the receptor. The importance of the thrombin anion-binding exosite for thrombin receptor recognition is highlighted by the low reactivity of gamma-thrombin for GST-TRE and by competition experiments, which in addition indicate that binding sites for fibrin(ogen), thrombomodulin and GST-TRE are overlapping. In contrast, binding of thrombin to GST-TRE and glycocalicin are not mutually exclusive, indicating that glycocalicin and TRE interact with discrete subsites within the large groove that constitutes the anion-binding exosite.",

While increased expression and secretion of DJ-1 into serum in patients with various cancers and regulation of p53 and PTEN by DJ-1 have been reported, the molecular mechanism underlying oncogenicity of DJ-1 is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the function of DJ-1 in the PI3'K signaling pathway under an oxidative stress condition, focusing on the interaction of DJ-1 with PTEN. We found that both wild-type (wt) and C106S-DJ-1, a substitution mutant of DJ-1, directly bound to PTEN and inhibited PTEN phosphatase activity but that C106S-DJ-1 more strongly inhibited the activity than did wt-DJ-1. When NIH3T3 cells were treated with H2O2, oxidation of C106 of wt-DJ-1 occurred, accompanied by increased binding of wt-DJ-1 to PTEN, decreased PTEN activity and increased phosphorylation of AKT. C106S-DJ-1 transformed cells more strongly than did wt-DJ-1 and the transforming activity of DJ-1 was enhanced by H2O2 treatment of cells in which increased binding of DJ-1 to PTEN and decreased PTEN activity were observed. Furthermore, TOF-MS analysis of the oxidative status of C106 suggested that DJ-1 activity requires the presence of the reduced form of C106, which accounts for >50% of the total form.

Whereas Cu triggers internalization of CTR1 from the plasma membrane, cDDP does not. To investigate the mechanisms of these effects, myc-tagged forms of wild type hCTR1 and variants in which Y103 was converted to alanine, C189 was converted to serine, or the K178/K179 dilysine motif was converted to alanines were re-expressed in mouse embryo cells in which both alleles of CTR1 had been knocked out and also in HEK293T cells. The Y103A mutation and to a lesser extent the C189S mutation reduced internalization of CTR1 induced by Cu while the K178A/K179A had little effect. Both Y103 and C189 were required for Cu and cDDP transport whereas the K178/K179 motif was not. While Y103 lies in an YXXM motif that, when phosphorylated, is a potential docking site for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and other proteins involved in endocytosis, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated myc-CTR1, and proteomic analysis of peptides derived from CTR1, failed to identify any basal or Cu-induced phosphorylation. However, proteomic analysis did identify an interaction of CTR1 with IRS-4 and this was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK cells expressing either FLAG-CTR1 or myc-CTR1. The interaction was greater in the Y103A-expressing cells. We conclude that Y103 is required for the internalization of hCTR1 in response to Cu, that this occurs by a mechanism other than phosphorylation and that mutation of Y103 modulates the interaction with IRS-4.",

The mechanisms how endogenous Rap1 is activated by many mitogenic stimuli including the neuropeptide bombesin remained unclear. Here we analyse which signaling pathways are necessary for Rap1 activation. Bombesin-mediated Rap1 activation in Swiss 3T3 and primary mouse embryo fibroblasts requires signaling components similar to those being essential for complex formation between p130Cas and Crk adapter proteins. The Crk/CRKL-binding region of the Rap1-specific exchange factor C3G (CBR) inhibits the bombesin-stimulated Rap1 activity in transfected Swiss 3T3 cells. Further characterization in COS cells showed that the CBR or a c-Crk I SH3 mutant specifically reduces both the basal as well as the stimulated Rap1 activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Ras is not affected. The CBR is complexed with endogenous c-Crk II and CRKL and blocks the protein association with catalytically active C3G. Such suppressors of Crk signaling do not affect Erk-phosphorylation induced by bombesin. Embryonic fibroblasts from b-raf knockout mice showed a bombesin-inducible Erk-phosphorylation, providing evidence that B-Raf does not link Rap1 to Erk-activation in bombesin-stimulated fibroblasts. We conclude that cellular Crk/CRKL complexes, recruited to upstream signaling components, contribute to basal and bombesin-induced Rap1 activity, which is independent from the Ras-Raf-Erk pathway under these circumstances.",

In contrast, data concerning the biochemical functions of the P19-promoted Rep proteins, Rep52 and Rep40, are lacking. Here, we describe enzymatic activities associated with a bacterially expressed maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Rep52 fusion protein.

An MBP-Rep52 chimera bearing a lysine-to-histidine substitution at position 116 (K116H) within a consensus helicase- and ATPase-associated motif (motif I or Walker A site) was deficient for both DNA helicase and ATPase activities. In contrast to a Rep78 A-site mutant protein bearing a corresponding amino acid substitution at position 340 (K340H), the MBP-Rep52 A-site mutant protein failed to exhibit a trans-dominant negative effect when it was mixed with wild-type MBP-Rep52 or MBP-Rep78 in vitro.

To gain further insight into the structural basis of dantrolene action, we have attempted to localize the dantrolene-binding sequence in RyR1/RyR2 by using GFP as a structural marker and three-dimensional cryo-EM. We inserted GFP into RyR2 after residues Arg-626 and Tyr-846 to generate GFP-RyR2 fusion proteins, RyR2Arg-626-GFP and RyR2Tyr-846-GFP. Insertion of GFP after residue Arg-626 abolished the binding of a bulky GST- or cyan fluorescent protein-tagged FKBP12.6 but not the binding of a smaller, nontagged FKBP12.6, suggesting that residue Arg-626 and the dantrolene-binding sequence are located near the FKBP12.6-binding site. Using cryo-EM, we have mapped the three-dimensional location of Tyr-846-GFP to domain 9, which is also adjacent to the FKBP12.6-binding site. To further map the three-dimensional location of the dantrolene-binding sequence, we generated 10 FRET pairs based on four known three-dimensional locations (FKBP12.6, Ser-437-GFP, Tyr-846-GFP, and Ser-2367-GFP). Based on the FRET efficiencies of these FRET pairs and the corresponding distance relationships, we mapped the three-dimensional location of Arg-626-GFP or -cyan fluorescent protein, hence the dantrolene-binding sequence, to domain 9 near the FKBP12.6-binding site but distant to the central region around residue Ser-2367. An allosteric mechanism by which dantrolene stabilizes interdomain interactions between the NH2-terminal and central regions is proposed.",

Its loss leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and is a hallmark of cancer. RB works by binding to members of the E2F family of transcription factors and recruiting chromatin modifiers to the promoters of E2F target genes. Here we show that RB also localizes to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) dependent on E2F1 and ATM kinase activity and promotes DSB repair through homologous recombination (HR), and its loss results in genome instability. RB is necessary for the recruitment of the BRG1 ATPase to DSBs, which stimulates DNA end resection and HR. A knock-in mutation of the ATM phosphorylation site on E2F1 (S29A) prevents the interaction between E2F1 and TopBP1 and recruitment of RB, E2F1, and BRG1 to DSBs. This knock-in mutation also impairs DNA repair, increases genomic instability, and renders mice hypersensitive to IR. Importantly, depletion of RB in osteosarcoma and breast cancer cell lines results in sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs, which is further exacerbated by poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. We uncovered a novel, nontranscriptional function for RB in HR, which could contribute to genome instability associated with RB loss.",

The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying LRRK2 action remain poorly defined. Synaptic dysfunction has been increasingly recognized as an early event in the pathogenesis of major neurological disorders. Using Drosophila as a model system, we have shown that LRRK2 controls synaptic morphogenesis. Loss of dLRRK (Drosophila LRRK2) results in synaptic overgrowth at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction synapse, whereas overexpression of wild-type dLRRK, hLRRK2 (human LRRK2) or the pathogenic hLRRK2-G2019S mutant has the opposite effect. Alteration of LRRK2 activity also affects synaptic transmission in a complex manner. LRRK2 exerts its effects on synaptic morphology by interacting with distinct downstream effectors at the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. At the postsynapse, LRRK2 functionally interacts with 4E-BP (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein) and the microRNA machinery, both of which negatively regulate protein synthesis. At the presynapse, LRRK2 phosphorylates and negatively regulates the microtubule-binding protein Futsch and functionally interacts with the mitochondrial transport machinery. These results implicate compartment-specific synaptic dysfunction caused by altered protein synthesis, cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial transport in LRRK2 pathogenesis and offer a new paradigm for understanding and ultimately treating LRRK2-related PD.",

Here, we demonstrate that NRIF is a substrate for TRAF6-mediated K63 polyubiquitination and that this modification is necessary for its nuclear translocation. Activation of p75 resulted in NRIF polyubiquitination, association with TRAF6 and nuclear localization. NRIF was polyubiquitinated by TRAF6 in vitro and in cultured cells, and this was abrogated by mutation of K19 in the amino-terminus of NRIF. The K19R mutant NRIF displayed reduced TRAF6 association and neurotrophin-dependent nuclear localization. In neurons from traf6-/- mice, NRIF failed to enter the nucleus in response to p75 activation, and polyubiquitination and nuclear localization were attenuated in traf6-/- brain. Finally, unlike wild-type NRIF, the K19R NRIF failed to reconstitute p75-mediated apoptosis in nrif-/- neurons.

We investigated the role of the hematopoietically restricted guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 in alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion. We find that Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac and Rho, associates with alpha(v)beta(3) upon cell adhesion to vitronectin and that this association requires beta(3) tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of exogenous Vav1 demonstrates that Y160F, but not wild type or the Vav1Y174F mutant, inhibits Rac and Rho activation during alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin. Cells expressing Vav1Y160F exhibit a sustained Cdc42 activation similar to nonphosphorylatable beta(3) mutants. In addition, cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion are severely suppressed in Vav1Y160F-transfected cells, and Vav1Y160F fails to associate with beta(3) integrins. Furthermore, Vav1 itself is selectively phosphorylated upon tyrosine 160 after alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion, and the association between Vav1 and beta(3) occurs in specific response to adhesion to substrate. These studies describe a phosphorylation-dependent association between beta(3) integrin and Vav1 which is essential for cell progression to a Rho-dominant phenotype during cell adhesion.",

Because CF is an orphan disease, therapeutic strategies aimed at improving mutant CFTR functions are needed to target the root cause of CF. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human CF airway epithelial cells were treated with roscovitine 100\u2009\u03bcM for 2\u2009h before CFTR maturation, expression and activity were examined. The mechanism of action of roscovitine was explored by recording the effect of depleting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) on the F508del-CFTR/calnexin interaction and by measuring proteasome activity. KEY RESULTS: Of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors investigated, roscovitine was found to restore the cell surface expression and defective channel function of F508del-CFTR in human CF airway epithelial cells. Neither olomoucine nor (S)-CR8, two very efficient CDK inhibitors, corrected F508del-CFTR trafficking demonstrating that the correcting effect of roscovitine was independent of CDK inhibition. Competition studies with inhibitors of the ER quality control (ERQC) indicated that roscovitine acts on the calnexin pathway and on the degradation machinery. Roscovitine was shown (i) to partially inhibit the interaction between F508del-CFTR and calnexin by depleting ER Ca(2+) and (ii) to directly inhibit the proteasome activity in a Ca(2+) -independent manner. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Roscovitine is able to correct the defective function of F508del-CFTR by preventing the ability of the ERQC to interact with and degrade F508del-CFTR via two synergistic but CDK-independent mechanisms. Roscovitine has potential as a pharmacological therapy for CF.",

PH-20 also induces the expression of a p53-interacting WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WOX1, also known as WWOX or FOR) in these cells. WOX1 enhances the cytotoxic function of tumor necrosis factor and mediates apoptosis synergistically with p53. Thus, the activated JNK1 is likely to counteract WOX1 in mediating apoptosis. Here it is demonstrated that ectopic JNK1 inhibited WOX1-mediated apoptosis of L929 fibroblasts, monocytic U937 cells, and other cell types. Also, JNK1 blocked WOX1 prevention of cell cycle progression. By stimulating cells with anisomycin or UV light, JNK1 became activated, and WOX1 was phosphorylated at Tyr(33). The activated JNK1 physically interacted with the phosphorylated WOX1, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Alteration of Tyr(33) to Arg(33) in WOX1 abrogated its binding interaction with JNK1 and its activity in mediating cell death, indicating that Tyr(33) phosphorylation is needed to activate WOX1. A dominant negative WOX1 was developed and shown to block p53-mediated apoptosis and anisomycin-mediated WOX1 phosphorylation but could not inhibit JNK1 activation. This mutant protein bound p53 but could not interact with JNK1, as determined in yeast two-hybrid analysis. Taken together, phosphorylation of JNK1 and WOX1 is necessary for their physical interaction and functional antagonism.",

Although VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2 are known to be high affinity receptors for VEGF, it is not clear which of the VEGFRs are responsible for the transmission of the diverse biological responses of VEGF. For this purpose we have constructed a chimeric receptor for VEGFR-1 (CTR) and VEGFR-2 (CKR) in which the extracellular domain of each receptor was replaced with the extracellular domain of human colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), and these receptors were expressed in pig aortic endothelial (PAE) cells. We show that CKR individually expressed in PAE cells is readily tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, autophosphorylated in vitro, and stimulates cell proliferation in a CSF-1-dependent manner. In contrast, CTR individually expressed in PAE cells showed no significant in vivo, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation and cell growth in response to CSF-1 stimulation. The kinase activity of CKR was essential for its biological activity, since mutation of lysine 866 to arginine abolished its in vivo, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogenic signals. Remarkably, activation of CTR repressed CKR-mediated mitogen-activate protein kinase activation and cell proliferation. Similar effects were observed for VEGFR-2 co-expressed with VEGFR-1. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that VEGFR-2 activation plays a positive role in angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation. In contrast, activation of VEGFR-1 plays a stationary role in angiogenesis by antagonizing VEGFR-2 responses.",

We have attempted to identify new signaling molecules that are important for the activation response. METHODS: Using a protein interaction screening protocol based on phage display, T-cell signaling components that associate with the adapter molecule, Grb2, the lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase Lyp was identified. Using transcriptional reporter assays, the role of Lyp in T-cell activation was studied by overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive mutants of Lyp. RESULTS: A GST fusion containing the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 bound to the nucleotide exchange factor Sos or Grb2-associated binder 2 (Gab2). In contrast, the N-terminal SH3-containing fusion bound to the protein tyrosine phosphatase Lyp. Grb2 was co-immunoprecipitated with Lyp in 293T cells overexpressing both proteins. Using Northern blot analysis, Lyp was found to be expressed predominantly in hematopoietic tissue, including spleen, lymph node, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Two human T-cell lines, Jurkat and HuT78, expressed both Lyp mRNA and protein. Overexpression of wild-type Lyp or a catalytically inactive, substrate-trapping mutant (D195A) in Jurkat cells inhibited transcriptional activity initiated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. In contrast, two other catalytically inactive mutants (R233M or C227S) had no effect. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a novel interaction between the phosphatase Lyp and the adaptor Grb2 and are consistent with a negative regulatory role for Lyp in T-cell signaling.",

We previous showed that Tip60 activity is induced by phosphorylation at T158 by p38. In this study, we investigated the role of p38-mediated Tip60 phosphorylation in p53-mediated, DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We found that DNA damage induces p38 activation, Tip60-T158 phosphorylation, and p53-K120 acetylation with similar kinetics. p38\u03b1 is essential for DNA damage-induced Tip60-T158 phosphorylation. In addition, both p38\u03b1 and Tip60 are essential for p53-K120 acetylation, binding of p53 to PUMA promoter, PUMA expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Moreover, DNA damage induces protein kinase activity of p38\u03b1 towards Tip60-T158, and constitutive activation of p38 in cells leads to increases in Tip60-T158 phosphorylation, p53-K120 acetylation, PUMA expression and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Tip60-T158A mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by p38 fails to mediate p53-K120 acetylation, PUMA induction, and apoptosis following DNA damage. These results establish that Tip60-T158 phosphorylation by p38 plays an essential role in stimulating Tip60 activity required for inducing the p53-PUMA pathway that ultimately leads to apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which provides a mechanistic basis for the tumor-suppressing function of p38 and Tip60.",

Mutations in KLHL3 cause constitutively increased renal salt reabsorption and impaired K(+) secretion, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia. Although clinical studies have shown that dietary K(+) intake affects blood pressure, the mechanisms have been obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the KLHL3 ubiquitin ligase complex is involved in the low-K(+)-mediated activation of Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) in the kidney. In the distal convoluted tubules of mice eating a low-K(+) diet, we found increased KLHL3 phosphorylation at S433 (KLHL3(S433-P)), a modification that impairs WNK binding, and also reduced total KLHL3 levels. These changes are accompanied by the accumulation of the target substrate WNK4, and activation of the downstream kinases SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive 1), resulting in NCC phosphorylation and its accumulation at the plasma membrane. Increased phosphorylation of S433 was explained by increased levels of active, phosphorylated protein kinase C (but not protein kinase A), which directly phosphorylates S433. Moreover, in HEK cells expressing KLHL3 and WNK4, we showed that the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces KLHL3(S433-P) and increases WNK4 levels by abrogating its ubiquitination. These data demonstrate the role of KLHL3 in low-K(+)-mediated induction of NCC; this physiologic adaptation reduces distal electrogenic Na(+) reabsorption, preventing further renal K(+) loss but promoting increased blood pressure.",

F5 PDGFR failed to activate PLC-gamma 1, P13K, or Ras and was unable to trigger DNA synthesis. Permitting association of F5 PDGFR with either PLC-gamma 1 or P13K restored Ras activation and a mitogenic response. Surprisingly, even though binding of the 64 kd protein almost fully restored Ras activation, it did not rescue the receptor's ability to trigger DNA synthesis.

The variant VWF A1(R545A) bound to GPIbalpha-CaM 20-fold more tightly, mainly because the association rate constant k(on) increased from 1,100 to 8,800 M(-1) s(-1). The GPIbalpha mutations G233V and M239V cause platelet-type pseudo-von Willebrand disease, and VWF A1 bound to GPIbalpha(G233V)-CaM and GPIbalpha(M239V)-CaM with a K(d) of 1.0 and 0.63 microM, respectively. The increased affinity of VWF A1 for GPIbalpha(M239V)-CaM was explained by an increase in k(on) to 4,500 M(-1) s(-1). GPIbalpha-CaM bound with similar affinity to recombinant VWF A1, to multimeric plasma VWF, and to a fragment of dispase-digested plasma VWF (residues Leu(480)/Val(481)-Gly(718)). VWF A1 and A1(R545A) bound to platelets with affinities and rate constants similar to those for binding to GPIbalpha-CaM, and botrocetin had the expected positively cooperative effect on the binding of VWF A1 to GPIbalpha-CaM. Therefore, allosteric regulation by botrocetin of VWF A1 binding to GPIbalpha, and the increased binding affinity caused by mutations in VWF or GPIbalpha, are reproduced by isolated structural domains. The substantial increase in k(on) caused by mutations in either A1 or GPIbalpha suggests that productive interaction requires rate-limiting conformational changes in both binding sites. The exceptionally slow k(on) and k(off) provide important new constraints on models for rapid platelet tethering at high wall shear rates.",

Hot spots are located by virtual alanine-scanning consensus predictions over three different energy functions and two different single-structure representations of the complex. Refined binding affinity predictions for select hot-spot mutations are carried out by applying first-principle methods such as the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) and solvated interaction energy (SIE) to the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories for mutated and wild-type complexes. Here, predicted hot-spot residues were actually mutated to alanine, and crystal structures of the mutated complexes were determined. Two mutated MP1-p14 complexes were investigated, the p14(Y56A)-mutated complex and the MP1(L63A,L65A)-mutated complex. Alternative ways to generate MD ensembles for mutant complexes, not relying on crystal structures for mutated complexes, were also investigated. The SIE function, fitted on protein-ligand binding affinities, gave absolute binding affinity predictions in excellent agreement with experiment and outperformed standard MM-GBSA predictions when tested on the MD ensembles of Ras-Raf and Ras-RalGDS protein-protein complexes. For wild-type and mutant MP1-p14 complexes, SIE predictions of relative binding affinities were supported by a yeast two-hybrid assay that provided semiquantitative relative interaction strengths. Results on the MP1-mutated complex suggested that SIE predictions deteriorate if mutant MD ensembles are approximated by just mutating the wild-type MD trajectory. The SIE data on the p14-mutated complex indicated feasibility for generating mutant MD ensembles from mutated wild-type crystal structure, despite local structural differences observed upon mutation. For energetic considerations, this would circumvent costly needs to produce and crystallize mutated complexes. The sensitized protein-protein interface afforded by the p14(Y56A) mutation identified here has practical applications in screening-based discovery of first-generation small-molecule hits for further development into specific modulators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.",

However, it is not known how various FTDP-17 mutations affect tau dephosphorylation by phosphoprotein phosphatases. In this study we have observed that when transfected into HEK-293 cells, tau is phosphorylated on various sites that are also phosphorylated in diseased human brains.

Crystallographic data of related nuclear receptors suggest that binding of 1, 25-(OH)2D3 by VDR induces conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), the most striking of which is a packing of the AF-2 helix onto the LBD adjacent to helices H3 and H4. In this study, a panel of VDR helix H3 mutants was generated, and residues in helix H3 that are important for ligand-activated transcription by the full-length VDR were identified. In particular, one mutant (VDR (Y236A)) exhibited normal ligand binding and heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) but was transcriptionally inactive. Yeast two-hybrid studies and in vitro protein interaction assays demonstrated that VDR (Y236A) was selectively impaired in interaction with AF-2-interacting coactivator proteins such as SRC-1 and GRIP-1. These data indicate an importance of helix H3 in the mechanism of VDR-mediated transcription, and they support the concept that helix H3 functions in concert with the AF-2 domain to form a transactivation surface for binding the p160 class of nuclear receptor coactivators.",

Although human TNF (hTNF) and murine TNF (mTNF) are very homologous, hTNF binds only to mTNF-RI. By measuring the binding of a panel of mTNF/hTNF chimeras to both mTNF-R, we pinpointed the TNF region that mediates the interaction with mTNF-RII. Using site-specific mutagenesis, we identified amino acids 71-73 and 89 as the main interacting residues. Mutein hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73 Delta/T89E interacts with both types of mTNF-R and is active in CT6 cell proliferation assays mediated by mTNF-RII. Mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Delta 73H/E89T binds to mTNF-RI only and is no longer active on CT6 cells. However, the L929s cytotoxicity of this mutein (an effect mediated by mTNF-RI triggering) was also 100-fold lower than that of wild-type mTNF due to enhanced dissociation during incubation at subnanomolar concentrations. The additional mutation of amino acid 102, resulting in the mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Delta 73H/E89T/P102Q, restored the trimer stability, which led to an enhanced specific activity on L929s cells. Hence the specific activity of a TNF species is governed not only by its receptor binding characteristics but also by its trimer stability after incubation at subnanomolar concentrations. In conclusion, the mutation of TNF amino acids 71-73, 89, and 102 is sufficient to obtain a mTNF mutein selective for mTNF-RI and a hTNF mutein that, unlike wild-type hTNF, also acts on mTNF-RII.",

The protein contains ten domains, each of ca. 90-100 amino acids; seven are members of the IgI family of proteins, three of the fibronectin type III family. The motifs are arranged in the following order (from N- to C-terminus): Ig-Ig-Ig-Ig-Ig-Fn-Fn-Ig-Fn-Ig. The C-terminal Ig motif (domain X or CX) contains its light meromyosin-binding site. A recombinant form of CX, beginning at Met-1027, exhibits saturable binding to myosin with an affinity comparable to the C-terminal 13 kDa chymotryptic fragment of native MyBP-C. To identify the surface in CX involved in its interaction with myosin, nine site-directed mutants (R37E, K43E, N49D, E52R, D56K, R73E, R74E, G80D and R103E) were constructed. Using a new assay for assessing the binding of CX with the light meromyosin (LMM) portion of myosin, we demonstrate that recombinant CX, just as the full-length protein, is able to facilitate LMM polymerization. Moreover, we show that residues Arg-37, Glu-52, Asp-56, Arg-73, and Arg-74 are involved in this interaction with the myosin rod. All of these amino acids interact with negatively charged residues of LMM, since the mutants R37E, R73E and R74E are unable to bind myosin, whereas E52R and D56K bind myosin with higher affinity than wild-type CX. Residues Lys-43 and Arg-103 show a small but significant influence on the binding reaction; residues Asn-49 and Gly-80 seem not to be involved in this interaction. Based on these data, a model is proposed for the interaction between MyBP-C CX and myosin filaments. In this model, CX interacts with four molecules of LMM at four different sites of the binding protein, thus explaining the effects of MyBP-C on the critical concentration of myosin polymerization.",

The pathogenic mechanisms that precede and promote the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies in neurons remain to be determined. Here, we constructed a series of alpha-synuclein-enhanced green fluorescent protein (alpha-synucleinEGFP, SynEGFP) fusion proteins to address whether the Parkinson's disease-associated mutations alter the subcellular distribution of alpha-synuclein, and to use as a tool for experimental manipulations to induce aggregate formation. When transfected into mouse cultured primary neurons, the 49-kDa alpha-synucleinEGFP fusion proteins are partially truncated to a approximately 27-kDa form. This non-fluorescent carboxy-terminally modified fusion protein spontaneously forms inclusions in the neuronal cytoplasm. A marked increase in the accumulation of inclusions is detected following treatment with each of three proteasome inhibitors, n-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal, lactacystin and MG132. Interestingly, Ala30Pro alpha-synucleinEGFP does not form the cytoplasmic inclusions that are characteristic of wild-type and Ala53Thr alpha-synucleinEGFP, supporting the idea that the Ala30Pro alpha-synuclein protein conformation differs from wild-type alpha-synuclein. Similar inclusions are formed if alpha-synuclein carboxy-terminus is modified by the addition of a V5/6xHistidine epitope tag. By contrast, overexpression of unmodified alpha-synuclein does not lead to aggregate formation. Furthermore, synphilin-1, an alpha-synuclein interacting protein also found in Lewy bodies, colocalizes with the carboxy-terminally truncated alpha-synuclein fusion protein in discrete cytoplasmic inclusions.Our finding that manipulations of the carboxy-terminus of alpha-synuclein lead to inclusion formation may provide a model for studies of the pathogenic mechanisms of alpha-synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies.",

Previous data show that BMK1 can be activated by steady laminar flow and is atheroprotective by preventing endothelial cells from undergoing apoptosis. The primary structure of BMK1 is distinct from other MAPK members by virtue of a unique long C-tail, suggesting specific mechanisms of regulation. To characterize regulatory mechanisms for BMK1 function, we identified binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Among these proteins, the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 was identified. BMK1 bound to 14-3-3beta in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-14-3-3beta fusion protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation. Phosphorylation of BMK1 was most likely required for this interaction. GST-14-3-3beta pull-down assays using truncated constructs of BMK1 and site-directed BMK1 mutants demonstrated that the interaction requires serine 486 within the C terminus of BMK1. BMK1 bound to 14-3-3beta basally, and the interaction was greatly abrogated when BMK1 was activated. The interaction of 14-3-3beta and BMK1 inhibited kinase activities stimulated by constitutively active (CA)-MEK5 and epidermal growth factor. Mutation of serine 486 (BMK1-S486A) prevented the interaction with 14-3-3beta and enhanced BMK1 activity upon epidermal growth factor stimulation. These data demonstrate an inhibitory function for 14-3-3beta binding to BMK1 and show that serine 486 phosphorylation represents a novel regulatory mechanism for BMK1.",

Although P2X7 receptors are frequently coexpressed with another subtype of P2X receptor, P2X4, they are believed not to form heteromeric assemblies but to function only as homomers. Both receptors play a role in neuropathic pain; therefore, understanding how they coordinate the cellular response to ATP is important for the development of effective pain therapies. Here, we provide biochemical and electrophysiological evidence for an association between P2X4 and P2X7 that increases the diversity of receptor currents mediated via these two subtypes. The heterologously expressed receptors were coimmunoprecipitated from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and the endogenous P2X4 and P2X7 receptors were similarly coimmunoprecipitated from bone marrow-derived macrophages. In HEK293 cells, the fraction of P2X4 receptors biotinylated at the plasma membrane increased 2-fold in the presence of P2X7 although there was no change in overall expression. Coexpression of a dominant-negative P2X4 mutant (C353W) with P2X7, inhibited P2X7 receptor mediated currents by greater than 2-fold, whereas a nonfunctional but non-dominant-negative mutant (S341W) did not. Coexpression of P2X4S341W with P2X7 produced a current that was potentiated by ivermectin and inhibited by 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), whereas expression of P2X7 alone produced a current that was insensitive to both of these compounds at the concentrations used.

However, the nature of those receptors and the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes but not epimastigotes were able to induce Rab5 activation and binding to the early endosomes in peritoneal macrophages. In this process, active Rab5 colocalized with parasites in the phagosome and with the Rab5A effector molecule early endosomal antigen 1. Phagosome formation and T. cruzi internalization were inhibited in Raw 264.7 macrophages expressing a dominant-negative form of Rab5 [(S34N)Rab5]. Using T. cruzi membrane extracts, we verified that the Rab5 activation depends on the interaction between parasite surface molecules and macrophages surface molecule. In addition, during infection of macrophages, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway was activated. Assays carried out using a selective PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) showed that the PI3K activation is essential for Rab5 activation by T. cruzi infection and for the entrance and intracellular replication of T. cruzi in macrophages. Moreover, using macrophages from knockout mice, we found that activation of Rab5, fusion of early endosomes and phagocytosis induced by T. cruzi infection involved Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 but were independent of TLR4 receptors.",

The high levels of kinase activity of the FGFR3-mutants cause uncompleted biosynthesis that results in the accumulation of the immature/mannose-rich, phosphorylated receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and STATs activation. Here we report that FGFR3 mutants activate Erk1/2 from the ER through an FRS2-independent pathway: instead, a multimeric complex by directly recruiting PLCgamma, Pyk2 and JAK1 is formed. The Erk1/2 activation from the ER however, is PLCgamma-independent, since preventing the PLCgamma/FGFR3 interaction by the Y754F substitution does not inhibit Erks. Furthermore, Erk1/2 activation is abrogated upon treatment with the Src inhibitor PP2, suggesting a role played by a Src family member in the pathway from the ER. Finally we show that the intrinsic kinase activity by mutant receptors is required to allow signaling from the ER. Overall these results highlight how activated FGFR3 exhibits signaling activity in the early phase of its biosynthesis and how segregation in a sub-cellular compartment can affect the FGFR3 multi-faceted capacity to recruit specific substrates.",

Immunoprecipitation studies of metabolically labeled cells showed that both types of receptors were synthesized and processed to the mature form of Mr 190,000.

PDGF was also shown to be chemotactic for cells expressing the wild-type receptor, whereas no chemotactic response was elicited in control cells or in cells expressing the K634A mutant receptor.

To better understand the role of Rab4 in regulation of vesicular trafficking, we searched for effectors that specifically interact with Rab4-Q67L, the GTP-bound form of Rab4. We cloned an ubiquitous 80-kDa protein, identical to CD2-associated protein/Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains (CD2AP/CMS), that interacts with Rab4-Q67L in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro. CD2AP/CMS expressed in mammalian cells was localized to punctate structures and along actin filaments. None of the known markers of early endosomes [Early Endosomes Antigen 1 (EEA1), Rab5 and Rab11] colocalized with the CD2AP/CMS-positive vesicles. However, coexpression of Rab4-Q67L with CD2AP/CMS induces a significant enlargement of EEA1-positive early endosomes. Rab4, CD2AP/CMS and Rab7 colocalized in these modified endosomes. Coexpression of c-Cbl and CD2AP/CMS also resulted in an enlargement of early endosomes. Using various truncated forms of CD2AP/CMS, we demonstrate that early endosomes enlargement requires that CD2AP/CMS interacts with both Rab4 and c-Cbl. The expression of a truncated form of CD2AP/CMS that retains the ability to interact with Rab4 but not c-Cbl inhibits ligand-induced PDGF receptor degradation. We propose that CD2AP/CMS, through interactions with Rab4 and c-Cbl, controls early endosome morphology and may play a role in traffic between early and late endosomes, and thus in the degradative pathway.",

In this study, we identified a stable and soluble C-terminal domain (residues 255-359) in Hexim1 of 12.5-kDa size that binds the cyclin boxes of Cyclin T1. Functional assays in HeLa cells showed that this cyclin T-binding domain (TBD) is required for the binding of Hexim1 to P-TEFb and inhibition of transcriptional activity in vivo. Analytical gel filtration and GST pull-down experiments revealed that both full-length Hexim1 and the TBD are homodimers. Isothermal titration calorimetry yielded a weak multimer for the TBD with a multimerization constant of 1.3 x 10(3) m. The binding affinity between the TBD and cyclin T1 was analyzed with fluorescence spectroscopy methods, using a dansyl-based fluorescence label at position G257C. Equilibrium fluorescence titration and stopped flow fast kinetics yield a dissociation constant of 1.2 mum. Finally, we tested the effect of the HIV-1 Tat protein on the cyclin T1-TBD complex formation. GST pull-down experiments and size exclusion chromatography exhibit a mutually exclusive binding of the two effectors to cyclin T1. Our data suggest a model where HIV-1 Tat competes with Hexim1 for cyclin T1 binding, thus releasing P-TEFb from the inactive complex to stimulate the transcription of HIV-1 gene expression.",

Many cancer-driving mutations induce activation of PDK1 targets including Akt, S6K (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase) and SGK (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase). In the present paper, we describe the small molecule GSK2334470, which inhibits PDK1 with an IC\u2085\u2080 of ~10 nM, but does not suppress the activity of 93 other protein kinases including 13 AGC-kinases most related to PDK1 at 500-fold higher concentrations. Addition of GSK2334470 to HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293, U87 or MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells ablated T-loop residue phosphorylation and activation of SGK isoforms and S6K1 induced by serum or IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). GSK2334470 also inhibited T-loop phosphorylation and activation of Akt, but was more efficient at inhibiting Akt in response to stimuli such as serum that activated the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway weakly. GSK2334470 inhibited activation of an Akt1 mutant lacking the PH domain (pleckstrin homology domain) more potently than full-length Akt1, suggesting that GSK2334470 is more effective at inhibiting PDK1 substrates that are activated in the cytosol rather than at the plasma membrane. Consistent with this, GSK2334470 inhibited Akt activation in knock-in embryonic stem cells expressing a mutant of PDK1 that is unable to interact with phosphoinositides more potently than in wild-type cells. GSK2334470 also suppressed T-loop phosphorylation and activation of RSK2 (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2), another PDK1 target activated by the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) pathway. However, prolonged treatment of cells with inhibitor was required to observe inhibition of RSK2, indicating that PDK1 substrates possess distinct T-loop dephosphorylation kinetics. Our data define how PDK1 inhibitors affect AGC signalling pathways and suggest that GSK2334470 will be a useful tool for delineating the roles of PDK1 in biological processes.",

As Parkin recruitment to mitochondria is robustly induced by PINK1 expression on the outer mitochondrial membrane, Parkin recruitment to mitochondria was used as an assay for PINK1 function. Unexpectedly, mutation of serine residues within the activation segment of PINK1 uncovered a temperature-sensitive variant of PINK1 (tsPINK1). tsPINK1 allowed for the first time the disassociation of PINK1 activity from its expression and localization. Additionally, extensive mutagenesis identified three disease-associated variants in the activation segment and one in an \u03b1-helix N-terminal to kinase domain (Q126P) that are similarly thermally labile, suggesting that their activity could be restored post-translationally (e.g. by reducing the temperature or by a chemical or pharmacologic chaperone). Together, these findings suggest that tsPINK1 may represent a valuable tool for the analysis of the PINK1/Parkin pathway in human cells; additionally, as the serine residue promoting thermal lability is conserved among Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, it may serve as the basis for developing other temperature-sensitive models for the study of recessive parkinsonism and mitophagy. Finally, these results suggest that PINK1 kinase function could be restored for a subset of patients with PINK1 mutations, and perhaps alter the course of their disease.",

Recent studies have identified a p53 relative, termed p73. We were interested in determining the relative abilities of wild-type and mutant forms of p53 and p73alpha and -beta isoforms to transactivate various p53-responsive promoters. We show that both p73alpha and p73beta activate the transcription of reporters containing a number of p53-responsive promoters in the p53-null cell line H1299. However, a number of significant differences were observed between p53 and p73 and even between p73alpha and p73beta. Additionally, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based reporter assay revealed a broad array of transcriptional transactivation abilities by both p73 isoforms at 37 degreesC. Recent data have shown that p73 can associate with p53 by the yeast two-hybrid assay. When we examined complex formation in transfected mammalian cells, we found that p73alpha coprecipitates with mutant but not wild-type p53. Since many tumor-derived p53 mutants are capable of inhibiting transactivation by wild-type p53, we tested the effects of two representative hot-spot mutants (R175H and R248W) on p73. By cotransfecting p73alpha along with either p53 mutant and a p53-responsive reporter, we found that both R175H and R248W reduces the transcriptional activity of p73alpha. This decrease in transcriptional activity is correlated with the reduced ability of p73alpha to promote apoptosis in the presence of tumor-derived p53 mutants. Our data suggest the possibility that in some tumor cells, an outcome of the expression of mutant p53 protein may be to interfere with the endogenous p73 protein.",

The ecdysone signal is transduced by the EcR/USP nuclear receptor heterodimer that binds to specific response elements in the genome and directly regulates target gene transcription. We describe a novel nuclear receptor interacting protein encoded by rigor mortis (rig) that is required for ecdysone responses during larval development. rig mutants display defects in molting, delayed larval development, larval lethality, duplicated mouth parts, and defects in puparium formation--phenotypes that resemble those seen in EcR, usp, E75A and betaFTZ-F1 mutants. Although the expression of these nuclear receptor genes is essentially normal in rig mutant larvae, the ecdysone-triggered switch in E74 isoform expression is defective. rig encodes a protein with multiple WD-40 repeats and an LXXLL motif, sequences that act as specific protein-protein interaction domains. Consistent with the presence of these elements and the lethal phenotypes of rig mutants, Rig protein interacts with several Drosophila nuclear receptors in GST pull-down experiments, including EcR, USP, DHR3, SVP and betaFTZ-F1. The ligand binding domain of betaFTZ-F1 is sufficient for this interaction, which can occur in an AF-2-independent manner. Antibody stains reveal that Rig protein is present in the brain and imaginal discs of second and third instar larvae, where it is restricted to the cytoplasm. In larval salivary gland and midgut cells, however, Rig shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a spatially and temporally regulated manner, at times that correlate with the major lethal phase of rig mutants and major switches in ecdysone-regulated gene expression. Taken together, these data indicate that rig exerts essential functions during larval development through gene-specific effects on ecdysone-regulated transcription, most likely as a cofactor for one or more nuclear receptors. Furthermore, the dynamic intracellular redistribution of Rig protein suggests that it may act to refine spatial and temporal responses to ecdysone during development.",

Transient expression of ASFV A179L gene in Vero cells prevented apoptosis induced by these active forms of Bid protein.

We and others reported recently that expression of the pathogenic gainof-function mutant form of LRRK2, LRRK2 G2019S, induces mitochondrial fission in neurons through DLP1. Here we provide evidence that expression of LRRK2 G2019S stimulates mitochondria loss or mitophagy. We have characterized several LRRK2 interacting proteins and found that LRRK2 interacts with ULK1 which plays an essential role in autophagy. Knockdown of either ULK1 or DLP1 expression with shRNAs suppresses LRRK2 G2019S expression-induced mitochondrial clearance, suggesting that LRRK2 G2019S expression induces mitochondrial fission through DLP1 followed by mitophagy via an ULK1 dependent pathway. In addition to ULK1, we found that LRRK2 interacts with the endogenous MKK4/7, JIP3 and coordinates with them in the activation of JNK signaling. Interestingly, LRRK2 G2019S-induced loss of mitochondria can also be suppressed by 3 different JNK inhibitors, implying the involvement of the JNK pathway in the pathogenic mechanism of mutated LRRK2. Thus our findings may provide an insight into the complicated pathogenesis of PD as well as some clues to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

In the case of cardiac muscle, three amino acid residues (Gln-31, Asn-32, and Phe-59) of FKBP12.6 could be essential for the selective binding to RyR2 (Xin, H. B., Rogers, K., Qi, Y., Kanematsu, T., and Fleischer, S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15315-15319). In this study to identify amino acid residues of FKBP12 that are important for the selective binding to RyR1, we mutated 9 amino acid residues of FKBP12 that differ from the counterparts of FKBP12.6 (Q3E, R18A, E31Q, D32N, M49R, R57A, W59F, H94A, and K105A), and we examined binding properties of these mutants to RyR1 by in vitro binding assay by using glutathione S-transferase-fused proteins of the mutants and Triton X-100-solubilized, FKBP12-depleted rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Among the nine mutants tested, only Q3E and R18A lost their selective binding ability to RyR1. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of RyR1 with 33 various mutants for the 9 positions produced by introducing different size, charge, and hydrophobicity revealed that an integration of the hydrogen bonds by the irreplaceable Gln-3 and the hydrophobic interactions by the residues Arg-18 and Met-49 could be a possible mechanism for the binding of FKBP12 to RyR1. Therefore, these results suggest that the N-terminal regions of FKBP12 (Gln-3 and Arg-18) and Met-49 are essential and unique for binding of FKBP12 to RyR1 in skeletal muscle.",

Whereas mTOR activates translation through ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), how it facilitates cell proliferation has remained unclear. We have now identified p19(Arf), an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, as a novel substrate of S6K that is targeted to promote cell proliferation. Serum stimulation induced activation of the mTOR-S6K axis and consequent phosphorylation of p19(Arf) at Ser(75). Phosphorylated p19(Arf) was then recognized by the F-box protein \u03b2-TrCP2 and degraded by the proteasome. Ablation of \u03b2-TrCP2 thus led to the arrest of cell proliferation as a result of the stabilization and accumulation of p19(Arf). The \u03b2-TrCP2 paralog \u03b2-TrCP1 had no effect on p19(Arf) stability, suggesting that phosphorylated p19(Arf) is a specific substrate of \u03b2-TrCP2. Mice deficient in \u03b2-TrCP2 manifested accumulation of p19(Arf) in the yolk sac and died in utero.

Overexpression of the long isoform (caspase-2L) promotes cell death whereas the short isoform (caspase-2S) antagonizes some apoptotic pathways. In the present study, we identified two additional CASP-2 mRNAs, designated CASP-2L-Pro and CASP-2s-Pro. The proteins encoded by these isoforms corresponded to the prodomain of procaspase-2L and -2S, in which the last alpha-helix of their caspase recruitment domains was deleted. Caspase-2L-Pro mRNA and protein were detected in a series of human tissues and cell lines. Yeast 2-hybrid assays and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that caspase-2L-Pro can interact with procaspase-2L and the adaptor protein RAIDD/CRADD, but not with FADD/MORT1 or APAF-1 adaptor proteins. The addition of recombinant caspase-2L-Pro negatively interfered with cytochrome c/dATP-mediated activation of the caspase cascade in a cell-free system. In transient expression studies of human B lymphoma Namalwa cells, overexpression of caspase-2L-Pro weakly induced apoptosis, which was prevented by a D83A/E87A double mutation. In stable selected CASP-2L-Pro-transfected Namalwa cells, overexpression of caspase-2L-Pro delayed apoptotic DNA fragmentation induced by death receptor agonists (anti-Fas antibodies, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and DNA topoisomerase I- (camptothecin) and II- (etoposide) inhibitors, and prevented etoposide-induced activation of the caspase cascade. These inhibitory effects were not observed in stable transfected cells expressing the D83A/E87A double mutant. Altogether, these data indicated that the caspase-2L-Pro isoform functions as an endogenous apoptosis inhibitory protein that antagonizes caspase activation and cell death.",

In addition to activation, p53 has been shown to be a potent repressor of transcription. However, the basis for p53-mediated repression is not well understood and has been proposed to occur indirectly through interactions with other promoter-bound transcription factors. In the present study, we show that p53 can repress transcription directly by binding to a novel head-to-tail (HT) site within the MDR1 promoter. A mutation that disrupted p53 binding to the MDR1 HT site blocked p53-mediated repression of the MDR1 promoter in transfection assays. Replacement of the HT site with a head-to-head (HH) site converted the activity of p53 from repression to activation, indicating that simple recruitment of p53 to the promoter is not sufficient for repression and that the orientation of the binding element determines the fate of p53-regulated promoters.",

The water-soluble FliH(X)-FliI(6) ATPase ring complex allows FliJ to efficiently interact with FlhA. However, the FlhA binding site of FliJ remains unknown. Here, we carried out genetic analysis of a region formed by well-conserved residues-Gln38, Leu42, Tyr45, Tyr49, Phe72, Leu76, Ala79, and His83-of FliJ. A structural model of the FliI(6)-FliJ ring complex suggests that they extend out of the FliI(6) ring. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FliJ inhibited the motility of and flagellar protein export by both wild-type cells and a fliH-fliI flhB(P28T) bypass mutant. Pulldown assays revealed that the reduced export activity of the export apparatus results from the binding of GST-FliJ to FlhA. The F72A and L76A mutations of FliJ significantly reduced the binding affinity of FliJ for FlhA, thereby suppressing the inhibitory effect of GST-FliJ on the protein export. The F72A and L76A mutations were tolerated in the presence of FliH and FliI but considerably reduced motility in their absence. These two mutations affected neither the interaction with FliI nor the FliI ATPase activity. These results suggest that FliJ(F72A) and FliJ(L76A) require the support of FliH and FliI to exert their export function.

A specific mutation in CDK4 codon 24 (Arginine to Cysteine) prevents p16 binding and thus inhibition by p16. This mutated CDK4 acts as a dominant oncogene and has been found in both sporadic and familial melanoma. To study the effects of other mutations in CDK4, we generated a panel of 18 CDK4 mutants using Charged-to-Alanine scanning mutagenesis, and investigated the p16-binding capacity of these mutants to identify novel sites involved in p16 binding. The mutant CDK4 proteins were generated by direct coupled transcription-translation in vitro and tested for binding to p16 using a p16-GST fusion protein. Several mutants demonstrated loss of p16 binding. In addition to the previously identified codon 24 mutants, alterations in and around codon 22, 25, 97, and 281 all showed loss of p16 binding capacity. These results indicate that several noncontiguous amino acid sequences on CDK4 are required for binding to p16, which suggests the existence of multiple sites of interaction with p16.

To determine whether this process is only controlled by the stability of the complex, we used computer-aided protein design to improve the interaction between Ras and effector. We challenged the Ras.Raf complex in this study because Raf among all effectors shows the highest Ras affinity and the fastest association kinetics. The proposed mutations were characterized as to their changes in dynamics and binding strength. We demonstrate that Ras-Raf interaction can only be improved at the cost of a loss in specificity of Ras.GTP versus Ras.GDP. As shown by NMR spectroscopy, the Raf mutation A85K leads to a shift of Ras switch I in the GTP-bound as well as in the GDP-bound state, thereby increasing the complex stability. In a luciferase-based reporter gene assay, Raf A85K is associated with higher signaling activity, which appears to be a mere matter of Ras-Raf affinity.",

To gain a better insight into the signal transduction mechanisms of PDGFR\u03b1 oncogenes, we mutated twelve potentially phosphorylated tyrosine residues of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 and identified three mutations that affected cell proliferation. In particular, mutation of tyrosine 720 in FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 or PDGFR\u03b1(D842V) inhibited cell growth and blocked ERK signaling in Ba/F3 cells. This mutation also decreased myeloproliferation in transplanted mice and the proliferation of human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors transduced with FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1. We showed that the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 bound directly to tyrosine 720 of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1. SHP2 knock-down decreased proliferation of Ba/F3 cells transformed with FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b1(D842V) and affected ERK signaling, but not STAT5 phosphorylation.

The results show that, in resting platelets, free RGS18 levels are relatively low, increasing when platelets are activated by thrombin. Free RGS18 levels also rise when platelets are rendered resistant to activation by exposure to prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) or forskolin, both of which increase platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. However, the mechanism for raising free RGS18 is different in these 2 settings. Whereas thrombin activates SHP-1 and causes dephosphorylation of SPL tyrosine residues, PGI2 and forskolin cause phosphorylation of SPL Ser94 without reducing tyrosine phosphorylation. Substituting alanine for Ser94 blocks cAMP-induced dissociation of the SPL/RGS/SHP-1 complex. Replacing Ser94 with aspartate prevents formation of the complex and produces a loss-of-function phenotype when expressed in mouse platelets. Together with the defect in platelet function we previously observed in SPL(-/-) mice, these data show that (1) regulated sequestration and release of RGS18 by intracellular binding proteins provides a mechanism for coordinating activating and inhibitory signaling networks in platelets, and (2) differential phosphorylation of SPL tyrosine and serine residues provides a key to understanding both.",

This induction requires TAg action on the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of tumor suppressors and is independent of the p53 pathway. In cell culture systems, the inactivation of Rb proteins requires both a J domain in TAg that interacts with hsc70 and an LXCXE motif that directs association with Rb proteins. Together these elements are sufficient to release E2Fs from their association with Rb family members. We have generated transgenic mice that express a J domain mutant (D44N) in villus enterocytes. In contrast to wild-type TAg, the D44N mutant is unable to induce enterocyte proliferation. Histological and morphological examination revealed that mice expressing the J domain mutant have normal intestines without loss of growth control. Unlike mice expressing wild-type TAg, mice expressing D44N do not reduce the protein levels of p130 and are also unable to dissociate p130-E2F DNA binding complexes. Furthermore, mice expressing D44N in a null p130 background are still unable to develop hyperplasia. These studies demonstrate that the ectopic proliferation of enterocytes by TAg requires a functional J domain and suggest that the J domain is necessary to inactivate all three pRb family members.",

          "text": "During certain types of cellular stress, the p53 tumor suppressor protein binds to DNA and transactivates a variety of genes that regulate critical responses including apoptosis, cell cycle checkpoints, differentiation, and angiogenesis. In addition, functional p53 is known to be required for efficient nucleotide excision repair (NER) of bulky DNA adducts generated through exposure to environmental mutagens such as UV light. Nonetheless, we previously showed that the model p53-mutated human adenocarcinoma strain SW480 is proficient in the removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) via NER. We undertook the present study to begin probing the molecular basis for this unexpected repair phenotype. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that SW480 is stable at the chromosomal level, i.e. manifests a karyotypic profile very similar to that revealed for this line as far back as 14 years ago. After fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using a probe complementary to the p53 gene, we found that 98% of the SW480 interphase nuclei contains three copies of the gene, later revealed to be localized on intact short arms of three chromosomes 17. DNA sequence analysis further showed that all three p53 copies in SW480 carry two point mutations (R273H and P309S), and levels of the corresponding mutated p53 protein are about 20-fold higher than in the closely related p53 wild-type strain LoVo. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we demonstrated that R273H/P309S p53 is able to bind with wild-type affinity to its consensus DNA sequence in vitro. Analysis of p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression and in vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) showed that, in wild-type LoVo cells, an exposure to cellular stress (e.g. UV or ionizing radiation) is necessary for p53 activation of the p21(Cip1/WAF1) promoter. In contrast, the R273H/P309S-mutated p53 protein in SW480 constitutively activates p21(Cip1/WAF1) in the absence of stress through an unknown mechanism. A similar phenomenon whereby mutated p53 in SW480 is able to induce NER-related proteins might explain the normal DNA repair phenotype previously observed in this strain. For now we conclude that, in general, results obtained using SW480 as a p53-deficient cell line should be interpreted very cautiously.",

In addition to the binding site for heparin, the 39/34-kDa fragment also contained binding sites for collagen and for platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib. Unlike native vWF, the 39/34-kDa fragment bound to GP Ib without the requirement for a modulator but showed increased binding in the presence of botrocetin. The 39/34-kDa vWF fragment was cross-linked to intact human platelets by using the membrane-impermeable, homobifunctional cross-linking reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. Two distinct cross-linked species of similar molecular weight (220/200 kDa, nonreduced; 190/175 kDa, reduced) were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, consistent with the cross-linking of the 125I-labeled 39/34-kDa vWF fragment to GP Ib. The formation of these cross-linked species was enhanced 1.5-2.5-fold in the presence of the modulator botrocetin. The platelet membrane protein involved in cross-linking was shown unequivocally to be GP Ib since (i) neither cross-linked species was formed with Bernard-Soulier syndrome platelets, which genetically lack the GP Ib-IX complex, (ii) both cross-linked species were specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-GP Ib polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and (iii) the formation of the cross-linked species was completely inhibited only by those anti-GP Ib-IX complex monoclonal antibodies that inhibited vWF-GP Ib-IX complex interaction. Proteolysis of cross-linked platelets with endoproteinase Lys-C, which preferentially cleaves off the N-terminal peptide domain on the alpha-chain of GP Ib, indicated that the 39/34-kDa vWF fragment was cross-linked exclusively to this region of the GP Ib-IX complex.",

This mutation leads to hepatocellular carcinoma, and we evaluated how WtHBx and MutHBx proteins differ in their interactions with the p53 tumor suppressor protein. This was experimentally addressed through co-immunoprecipitation assays examining the interaction between WtHBx and MutHBx proteins with p53, reporter assays determining the impact of the HBx proteins on p53-mediated gene transcription, and clonogenic survival assays evaluating the effect of HBx on cell growth in lines of varying p53-expression status. Both WtHBx and MutHBx proteins physically interact with p53 protein, but have different impacts on p53-mediated gene transcription. WtHBx did not effect p53-mediated gene transcription, whereas MutHBx inhibited it (P < 0.01). MutHBx inhibited colony formation in p53-proficient cells (P < 0.01), but not p53-deficient lines. Although both HBx proteins interact with p53, they affect p53-mediated gene transcription differently. WtHBx has no effect, whereas MutHBx inhibits it. In clonogenic survival assays, MutHBx inhibited cell growth in p53-proficient cells rather than enhanced it. This suggests that for MutHBx to behave oncogenically, the p53 pathway must be crippled or absent. This study has identified some important novel ways in which WtHBx and MutHBx differentially interact with p53 and this could begin to form the cellular explanation for the association between this particular mutant and liver cancer.",

A detailed study using many biophysical methods has revealed that Hsp90 prevents \u03b1-synuclein from aggregating in an ATP-independent manner and that it forms a strong complex with the transiently populated toxic oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein species formed along the aggregation pathway. We have also shown that, upon forming a complex with Hsp90, the oligomers are rendered harmless and nontoxic to cells. Thus, we have clear evidence that Hsp90 is likely to play an important role on these processes in vivo. ",

However, the underlying basis for the breast tissue-restricted, tumor-suppressive properties of BRCA1 remains poorly defined. Here, we show that BRCA1 and the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) modulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transcription and secretion in breast cancer cells. ER-alpha interacted in vitro and in vivo with BRCA1, and this interaction was mediated by the AF-2 domain of ER-alpha and two domains of BRCA1, the amino-acid residues 1-306 and 428-683. Endogenous interaction of ER-alpha with BRCA1 was observed in normal MCF-10A breast epithelial cells and in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D), and this interaction was significantly reduced in the presence of estrogen. Furthermore, ER-alpha induced activation of VEGF gene transcription, using human VEGF promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. The AF-2 domain of ER-alpha was also shown to induce VEGF gene transcription activation similar to that obtained with the full-length ER-alpha. However, in the presence of BRCA1, VEGF gene transcription activation and VEGF protein secretion were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The BRCA1 domain of 1-683 amino acid residues was required for this inhibition of VEGF gene transcription activation. Three mutated forms of BRCA1 (A1708E, M1775R and Y1853X), that have been identified in familial breast cancers, failed to associate with ER-alpha and to suppress VEGF promoter activity and VEGF protein secretion. Overexpression of wild-type BRCA1 in HCC-1937 breast cancer cells that lack endogenous functional BRCA1 significantly reduced VEGF secretion in these cells. These results demonstrate a novel pathogenic mechanism whereby mutations in BRCA1, via their interaction with ER-alpha, could promote tumorigenesis through the hormonal regulation of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and impaired VEGF function, which may lead to cancer growth and angiogenesis.",

L166P protein may also accumulate into insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates with a mechanism facilitated by the E3 ligase TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Upon proteasome impairment L166P activates the JNK/p38 MAPK apoptotic pathway by its interaction with TRAF and TNF Receptor Associated Protein (TTRAP). When proteasome activity is blocked in the presence of wild-type DJ-1, TTRAP forms aggregates that are localized to the cytoplasm or associated to nucleolar cavities, where it is required for a correct rRNA biogenesis. In this study we show that in post-mortem brains of sporadic PD patients TTRAP is associated to the nucleolus and to Lewy Bodies, cytoplasmic aggregates considered the hallmark of the disease. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, misfolded mutant DJ-1 L166P alters rRNA biogenesis inhibiting TTRAP localization to the nucleolus and enhancing its recruitment into cytoplasmic aggregates with a mechanism that depends in part on TRAF6 activity.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by applying laser confocal microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. In KGN cells, forskolin (a PKA stimulator) could reorganize wild-type Ad4BP/SF-1, but not mutant Ad4BP/SF-1 (G35E), from a diffuse distribution pattern to foci formation in the nucleus. The subcellular distributions of GCN5 (general control nonderepressed) and TRRAP (transformation/transcription domain-associated protein), both of which were recently proved to be working in the same complex as the third class of nuclear receptor coactivators, were unexpectedly diffuse inside and outside the nucleus, respectively, when they were separately transfected. However TRRAP was translocated into the nucleus in the presence of GCN5, and together with GCN5 colocalized with Ad4BP/SF-1 in the same foci when PKA was activated. A luciferase assay also indicated that these two cofactors enhanced Ad4BP/SF-1 transactivation.Dosage-sensitive sex reversal (DAX-1) interacts with and thus inhibits Ad4BP/SF-1 transactivation. The coexistence of the two proteins dramatically altered their respective subnuclear distributions. They colocalized extensively, suggestive of binding, and Ad4BP/SF-1 was sharply immobilized when DAX-1 was coexpressed, whereas PKA could maintain mobility, as evidenced by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching showing that Ad4BP/SF-1 mobility recovered after forskolin treatment.Therefore, the PKA signal pathway may modify the interaction between Ad4BP/SF-1 and its activators and repressor (GCN5 and TRRAP are integrated, whereas DAX-1 is disassociated), and thus stimulate the Ad4BP/SF-1 transactivation.",

However, the association of EGFR and kinase-deficient Neu proteins (point mutant N757 or cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant N691stop) results in a defective or inactive heterodimeric complex. In this report we explore the biological consequences of heterodimerization between EGFR and wild-type (WT) or kinase-deficient mutant Neu proteins in living cells. We show that co-expression of EGFR and kinase-deficient Neu proteins abolished the synergistic transformation and tumorigenicity. Moreover, the normal responses of EGFR to ligand were significantly suppressed, e.g., loss of EGF-dependent transformation, reduced rate of receptor endocytosis and turnover, diminished DNA synthesis, and decreased EGF binding affinity. These results provide the first evidence that kinase-deficient Neu proteins suppress normal EGFR function and display a dominant negative mutant phenotype. Together with the stimulatory effects observed in cells forming active heterodimers, these studies provide a role for heterodimerization of EGFR and Neu/c-erbB2 in interreceptor activation and synergistic signaling which may be responsible for the transition from normal receptor function into oncogenesis.",

As visualized by fluorescence microscopy, rapid transduction of recombinant Antennapedia-isoleucine zipper (Izip)-CD40 cytoplasmic domain fusion protein (Antp-CD40) occurred in both the DND39 B cell line and human tonsillar B cells. Upon cellular entry, Antp-CD40 activated NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, induced proteolytic processing of p100 to the p52/NF-kappaB2 subunit, and increased expression of CD80 and CD54 on the surface of B cells. Antp-CD40 transduction of B cells did not, however, activate detectable levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase and did not up-regulate CD95 expression. Analysis of Antp-CD40 complexes recovered from transduced B cells revealed that Antp-CD40 associated with endogenous TRAF3 and Ku proteins. Multimerization of Antp-CD40, or extensive clustering of transmembrane CD40, diminished the disruptive effect of the T254A mutation in the TRAF2/3 binding site of the CD40 cytoplasmic domain. Taken together, these results indicate that Antp-CD40 mimics some of the natural CD40 signaling pathways in B cells by assembling partially functional signaling intermediates that do not require plasma membrane localization. We present a novel approach for delivering pre-activated, soluble receptor cytoplasmic domains into cells and recovering intact signaling complexes for molecular analysis.",

Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) inhibit G protein-dependent signal transduction by accelerating Galpha(i) GTP hydrolysis, shortening the duration of G protein effector stimulation. RGS16 contains two conserved tyrosine residues in the RGS box, Tyr(168) and Tyr(177), which are predicted sites of phosphorylation. RGS16 underwent phosphorylation in response to m2 muscarinic receptor or EGFR stimulation in HEK 293T or COS-7 cells, which required EGFR kinase activity. Mutational analysis suggested that RGS16 was phosphorylated on both tyrosine residues (Tyr(168) Tyr(177)) after EGF stimulation. RGS16 co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR, and the interaction did not require EGFR activation. Purified EGFR phosphorylated only recombinant RGS16 wild-type or Y177F in vitro, implying that EGFR-mediated phosphorylation depended on residue Tyr(168). Phosphorylated RGS16 demonstrated enhanced GTPase accelerating (GAP) activity on Galpha(i). Mutation of Tyr(168) to phenylalanine resulted in a 30% diminution in RGS16 GAP activity but completely eliminated its ability to regulate G(i)-mediated MAPK activation or adenylyl cyclase inhibition in HEK 293T cells. In contrast, mutation of Tyr(177) to phenylalanine had no effect on RGS16 GAP activity but also abolished its regulation of G(i)-mediated signal transduction in these cells. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates RGS16 function and that EGFR may potentially inhibit Galpha(i)-dependent MAPK activation in a feedback loop by enhancing RGS16 activity through tyrosine phosphorylation.",

Constitutive activation of Stat3 alpha by upstream oncoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases has been found in many human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. Constitutively activated Stat3 alpha is often correlated with the activation of ErbB-2, a member of the EGFR family. To explore the involvement of ErbB-2 in the activation of Stat3 and the mechanism underlying this event, an ErbB-2 point mutant was used as a model of constitutively activated receptor. Phenylalanine mutations (Y-->F) were made in the autophosphorylation sites of the receptor, and their ability to activate Stat3 alpha was evaluated. Our results suggest that Stat3 alpha and JAK2 associates with ErbB-2 prior to phosphorylation of the receptor and that full activation of Stat3 alpha by ErbB-2 requires the participation of other non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Both Src and Jak2 kinases contribute to the activation of Stat3 alpha but Src binds to ErbB-2 only when the receptor is phosphorylated. Our results also suggest that tyrosine 1139 may be important for Src homology 2 domain association because a mutant lacking this tyrosine reduces the ability of the Src homology 2 domain to bind to ErbB-2 and significantly decreases its ability to activate Stat3 alpha.",

PREP inhibitors reduce aSyn aggregation, but the mechanism has remained unknown. We have now used protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA) and microscale thermophoresis in parallel to show that PREP interacts directly with aSyn in both intact cells and in a cell-free system. Using split luciferase-based PCA, we first showed that PREP enhances the formation of soluble aSyn dimers in live Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cells. A PREP inhibitor, KYP-2047, reduced aSyn dimerization in PREP-expressing cells but not in cells lacking PREP expression. aSyn dimerization was also enhanced by PREP(S554A), an enzymatically inactive PREP mutant, but this was not affected by KYP-2047. PCA and microscale thermophoresis studies showed that aSyn interacts with both PREP and PREP(S554A) with low micromolar affinity. Neither the proline-rich, C-terminal domain of aSyn nor the hydrolytic activity of PREP was required for the interaction with PREP. Our results show that PREP binds directly to aSyn to enhance its dimerization and may thus serve as a nucleation point for aSyn aggregation. Native gel analysis showed that KYP-2047 shifts PREP to a compact monomeric form with reduced ability to promote aSyn nucleation. As PREP inhibition also enhances autophagic clearance of aSyn, PREP inhibitors may reduce accumulation of aSyn inclusions via a dual mechanism and are thus a novel therapeutic candidate for synucleinopathies. Our results also suggest that PREP has other cellular functions in addition to its peptidase activity.",

They induce different signaling profiles at the LHCGR. This cannot be explained by binding to the receptor's leucine-rich-repeat domain (LRRD), as this binding is similar for the two hormones. We therefore speculate that there are previously unknown differences in the hormone/receptor interaction at the extracellular hinge region, which might help to understand functional differences between the two hormones. We have therefore performed a detailed study of the binding and action of LH and CG at the LHCGR hinge region. We focused on a primate-specific additional exon in the hinge region, which is located between LRRD and the serpentine domain. The segment of the hinge region encoded by exon10 was previously reported to be only relevant to hLH signaling, as the exon10-deletion receptor exhibits decreased hLH signaling, but unchanged hCG signaling. We designed an advanced homology model of the hormone/LHCGR complex, followed by experimental characterization of relevant fragments in the hinge region. In addition, we examined predictions of a helical exon10-encoded conformation by block-wise polyalanine (helix supporting) mutations. These helix preserving modifications showed no effect on hormone-induced signaling. However, introduction of a structure-disturbing double-proline mutant LHCGR-Q303P/E305P within the exon10-helix has, in contrast to exon10-deletion, no impact on hLH, but only on hCG signaling. This opposite effect on signaling by hLH and hCG can be explained by distinct sites of hormone interaction in the hinge region. In conclusion, our analysis provides details of the differences between hLH- and hCG-induced signaling that are mainly determined in the L2-beta loop of the hormones and in the hinge region of the receptor.",

However, this interaction and its consequence in cancer treatments are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ZBP\u201189 is essentially required in HDACi-mediated p21 upregulation in hepetocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of ZBP-89 protein enhanced the lethal effectiveness of Trichostatin A (TSA). p53 mutant p53(G245D), but not p53(R249S), directly bound to ZBP-89 and prevented its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus. Furthermore, p53(G245D) was shown to have a similar pattern of subcellular localization to ZBP-89 in tissues of HCC patients in Hong Kong. Functionally, the cytoplasmic accumulation of ZBP-89 by p53(G245D) significantly abrogated the induction of p21 caused by sodium butyrate (NaB) treatment and protected cells from TSA-induced death. The activations of several apoptotic proteins, such as Bid and PARP, were involved in p53(G245D)-mediated protection. Moreover, the resistance to HDACi in p53(G245D)-expressing cells was reversed by overexpression of ZBP-89. Taken together, these data suggest a potential mechanism via which mutant p53 enables tumor cells to resist chemotherapy and, therefore, establish a plausible link between mutant p53 binding to ZBP-89 and a decreased chemosensitivity of HCC cells.",

N757 can be transphosphorylated by associated EGFR upon EGF stimulation. However, the heterodimer composed of EGFR and N691stop is kinase inactive. These results provided evidence that the Neu ectodomain is sufficient to associate with EGFR physically, and the cytoplasmic domain interaction is required for heterodimeric kinase activation, indicating that Neu/c-erbB2 is not just a simple substrate for EGFR but a transactivator as well.",

Through an RNAi screen, here we identify the transcriptional repressor MAFG as the pivotal factor required for MLH1 silencing and CIMP in CRCs containing BRAF(V600E). In BRAF-positive human CRC cell lines and tumors, MAFG is bound at the promoters of MLH1 and other CIMP genes, and recruits a corepressor complex that includes its heterodimeric partner BACH1, the chromatin remodeling factor CHD8, and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, resulting in hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. BRAF(V600E) increases BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling resulting in phosphorylation and elevated levels of MAFG, which drives DNA binding. Analysis of transcriptionally silenced CIMP genes in KRAS-positive CRCs indicates that different oncoproteins direct the assembly of distinct repressor complexes on common promoters. ",

We show that PKD2 overexpression increases epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced inward currents in LLC-PK(1) kidney epithelial cells, while the knockdown of endogenous PKD2 by RNA interference or the expression of a pathogenic missense variant, PKD2-D511V, blunts the EGF-induced response. Pharmacological experiments indicate that the EGF-induced activation of PKD2 occurs independently of store depletion but requires the activity of phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Pipette infusion of purified phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) suppresses the PKD2-mediated effect on EGF-induced conductance, while pipette infusion of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) does not have any effect on this conductance. Overexpression of type Ialpha phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase [PIP(5)Kalpha], which catalyzes the formation of PIP(2), suppresses EGF-induced currents. Biochemical experiments show that PKD2 physically interacts with PLC-gamma2 and EGF receptor (EGFR) in transfected HEK293T cells and colocalizes with EGFR and PIP(2) in the primary cilium of LLC-PK(1) cells. We propose that plasma membrane PKD2 is under negative regulation by PIP(2).

The interaction of this protein with the IR has been shown to be mediated in part by the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Grb10. Here we demonstrate the existence of a second novel domain within Grb10 that interacts with the IR and insulin-like growth factor receptor in a kinase-dependent manner. This domain was localized to a region of approximately 50 amino acids, and we term it the BPS domain to denote its location between the PH and SH2 domains. The BPS domain does not bear any obvious resemblance to other known protein interaction domains but is highly conserved among the Grb10-related proteins Grb7 and Grb14. We show that the BPS domain interaction is dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, interaction of the BPS domain requires the kinase domain of the IR, since mutation of the paired tyrosine residues (Y1150F/Y1151F) within the IR activation loop dramatically reduced the interaction. Last, our data suggest that the presence of two distinct protein interaction domains may help to determine the specificity by which Grb10 interacts with different receptors. Specifically, the IR, which appears to interact most strongly with Grb10, interacts well with both the SH2 and BPS domains. Conversely, the insulin-like growth factor receptor and EGFR, which interact less avidly with Grb10, interact well only with the BPS domain or the SH2 domain, respectively. In summary, our findings demonstrate the existence of a previously unidentified tyrosine kinase activity-dependent binding domain located between the Pleckstrin homology and SH2 domains of Grb10.",

Transient expression of alpha q-R183C in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells constitutively activates PI-PLC, but wild type (WT) alpha q does not. This suggests that the mutated arginines in alpha s, alpha i2, and alpha q share a common function in regulating the active state of these proteins and that the alpha q gene may serve as a target for oncogenic mutations in human tumors. In an attempt to develop an assay for receptor stimulation of recombinant alpha q, we co-expressed receptors with alpha q-WT. We found that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulates PI-PLC activation in HEK-293 cells in a fashion that depends completely on co-expression of alpha q-WT.

However, the slow transcriptional induction of p53R2 in RNA may not be rapid enough for prompt DNA damage repair, which has to occur within a few hours of damage. Here, we demonstrate that p53R2 becomes rapidly phosphorylated at Ser(72) by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) within 30 min after genotoxic stress. p53R2, as well as its heterodimeric partner RRM1, are associated with ATM in vivo. Mutational studies further indicate that ATM-mediated Ser(72) phosphorylation is essential for maintaining p53R2 protein stability and conferring resistance to DNA damage. The mutation of Ser(72) on p53R2 to alanine results in the hyperubiquitination of p53R2 and reduces p53R2 stability. MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, interacts and facilitates ubiquitination of the S72A-p53R2 mutant more efficiently than WT-p53R2 after DNA damage in vivo.

          "text": "BACKGROUND: The 14-3-3 (YWHA) proteins are highly conserved in higher eukaryotes, participate in various cellular signaling pathways including cell cycle regulation, development and growth. Our previous studies demonstrated that 14-3-3\u03b5 (YWHAE) is responsible for maintaining prophase | arrest in mouse oocyte. However, roles of 14-3-3\u03b5 in the mitosis of fertilized mouse eggs have remained unclear. Here, we showed that 14-3-3\u03b5 interacts and cooperates with CDC25B phosphorylated at Ser321 regulating G2/M transition of mitotic progress of fertilized mouse eggs. RESULTS: Disruption of 14-3-3\u03b5 expression by RNAi prevented normal G2/M transition by inhibition of MPF activity and leaded to the translocation of CDC25B into the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Overexpression of 14-3-3\u03b5-WT and unphosphorylatable CDC25B mutant (CDC25B-S321A) induced mitotic resumption in dbcAMP-arrested eggs. In addition, we examined endogenous and exogenous distribution of 14-3-3\u03b5 and CDC25B. Endogenous 14-3-3\u03b5 and CDC25B were co-localized primarily in the cytoplasm at the G1, S, early G2 and M phases whereas CDC25B was found to accumulate in the nucleus at the late G2 phase. Upon coexpression with RFP-14-3-3\u03b5, GFP-CDC25B-WT and GFP-CDC25B-S321A were predominantly cytoplasmic at early G2 phase and then GFP-CDC25B-S321A moved to the nucleus whereas CDC25B-WT signals were observed in the cytoplasm without nucleus accumulation at late G2 phase at presence of dbcAMP. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that 14-3-3\u03b5 is required for the mitotic entry in the fertilized mouse eggs. 14-3-3\u03b5 is primarily responsible for sequestering the CDC25B in cytoplasm and 14-3-3\u03b5 binding to CDC25B-S321 phosphorylated by PKA induces mitotic arrest at one-cell stage by inactivation of MPF in fertilized mouse eggs.",

Based on structural alignment between this porcine enzyme and seven determined crystal structures of complexes of NADP with bacterial IDHs, Arg83, Thr311, and Asn328 were chosen as targets for site-directed mutagenesis of porcine IDH. The circular dichroism spectra of purified wild-type and mutant enzymes are similar. The mutant enzymes exhibit little change in Km for isocitrate or Mn2+, showing that these residues are not involved in substrate binding. In contrast, the Arg83 mutants, Asn328 mutants, and T311A exhibit 3-20-fold increase in the Km(NADP). We propose that Arg83 enhances NADP affinity by hydrogen bonding with the 3'-OH of the nicotinamide ribose, whereas Asn328 hydrogen bonds with N1 of adenine. The pH dependence of Vmax for Arg83 and Asn328 mutants is similar to that of wild-type enzyme, but for all the Thr311 mutants, pK(es) is increased from 5.2 in the wild type to approximately 6.0. We have previously attributed the pH dependence of Vmax to the deprotonation of the metal-bound hydroxyl of isocitrate in the enzyme-substrate complex, prior to the transfer of a hydride from isocitrate to NADP's nicotinamide moiety. Thr311 interacts with the nicotinamide ribose and is the closest of the target amino acids to the nicotinamide ring. Distortion of the nicotinamide by Thr311 mutation will likely be transmitted to Mn2+-isocitrate resulting in an altered pK(es). Because porcine and human mitochondrial NADP-IDH have 95% sequence identity, these results should be applicable to the human enzyme.",

The inhibitory effect of Mdm2 on p53 has to be tightly regulated for proper p53 activity. Phosphorylation is an important level of p53 regulation. In response to DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated at several N-terminal serines. In this study we examined the role of Ser20, a potential phosphorylation site in human p53, in the regulation of p53 stability and function. Substitution of Ser20 by Ala (p53-Ala20) significantly increases the susceptibility of human p53 to negative regulation by Mdm2 in vivo, as measured by apoptosis and transcription activation assays. Mutation of Ser20 to Ala renders p53 less stable and more prone to Mdm2-mediated degradation. While the in vitro binding of p53 to Mdm2 is not increased by the Ala20 mutation, the same mutation results in a markedly enhanced binding in vivo. This is consistent with the conclusion that phosphorylation of Ser20 in vivo attenuates the binding of wild-type p53 to Mdm2. Peptides bearing non-phosphorylated Ser20 or Ala20 compete with p53 for Mdm2 binding, while a similar peptide with phosphorylated Ser20 does not. This implies a critical role for Ser20 in modulating the negative regulation of p53 by Mdm2, probably through phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of p53-Mdm2 interaction.",

We have identified a representative member of each class of PI3Ks in Drosophila using a PCR-based approach. In the present paper we describe the molecular cloning of a PI3K from Drosophila, P13K_59F, that shows sequence similarity to Vps34. PI3K_59F encodes a protein of 108 kDa co-linear with Vps34 homologues, and with three regions of sequence similarity to other PI3Ks. Biochemical characterization of the enzyme, by expression of the complete coding sequence as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Sf9 cells, demonstrates that PI3K_59F is a PtdIns-specific PI3K that can utilize either Mg2+ or Mn2+. This activity is sensitive to inhibition both by non-ionic detergent (Nonidet P40) and by wortmannin (IC50 10 nM).

Two adjacent hydrophobic amino acids (Ile-2588 and Ile-2589) at the putative cytosolic interface of the S6 helix inactivated channel function and could be candidates for the channel gate. Of five negatively charged residues mutated, none completely eliminated channel function. Of five positively charged residues mutated, only one inactivated the channel (Arg-2596).

These family members are RNA binding proteins that contain an extended KH domain embedded in a larger domain called the GSG (for GRP33-Sam68-GLD-1) domain. An ethylnitrosourea-induced point mutation in the Qk1 GSG domain alters glutamic acid 48 to a glycine and is known to be embryonically lethal in mice. The function of Qk1 and the GSG domain as well as the reason for the lethality are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the Qk1 GSG domain mediates RNA binding and Qk1 self-association. By using in situ chemical cross-linking studies, we showed that the Qk1 proteins exist as homodimers in vivo. The Qk1 self-association region was mapped to amino acids 18 to 57, a region predicted to form coiled coils. Alteration of glutamic acid 48 to glycine (EG) in the Qk1 GSG domain (producing protein Qk1:EG) abolishes self-association but has no effect on the RNA binding activity. The expression of Qk1 or Qk1:EG in NIH 3T3 cells induces cell death by apoptosis. Approximately 90% of the remaining transfected cells are apoptotic 48 h after transfection. Qk1:EG was consistently more potent at inducing apoptosis than was wild-type Qk1. These results suggest that the mouse quaking lethality (EG) occurs due to the absence of Qk1 self-association mediated by the GSG domain.",

Endophilin consists of two regions: an SH3 domain that interacts with other endocytotic proteins and an N-BAR domain that binds and bends membranes. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) under fluid to examine the interaction of the endophilin N-BAR domain with planar supported lipid bilayers, under conditions that closely mimic the environment in which this protein normally operates. We found that when bound to lipid bilayers, the N-BAR domain formed aggregates of various sizes. The N-BAR domain also perturbed the structure of the planar bilayer, at a low concentration (0.15 microM) causing bilayer thinning, and at a 10-fold higher concentration (1.5 microM) forming thin slivers from the bilayer sheet. This bilayer sculpting effect crucially involved the central appendage domain. Reduced hydrophobicity in this domain, caused by the A66D mutation, almost abolished the ability of the endophilin N-BAR domain to bind to supported bilayers. In contrast, increased hydrophobicity, caused by the A66W mutation, switched the bilayer sculpting effect of the N-BAR domain from sliver formation to vesiculation. By following the action of the endophilin N-BAR domain under near-physiological conditions, we have been able to provide additional insights into its membrane binding and bending mechanism.",

In the present study, we have identified amino acid residues in eIF2beta required for binding to eIF2gamma in yeast. Alteration of six residues in the central region of eIF2beta abolished this interaction, as determined by GST-pull down and two-hybrid assays, and leads to cell lethality. Substitution of (131)Tyr and (132)Ser by alanine residues ((131)YS), although abolishing the binding to eIF2gamma in these assays, resulted in a functional but defective protein in vivo, imparting a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype to cells. A dramatically weakened association of this mutant protein with eIF2gamma in vivo was shown by co-immunoprecipitation. The (131)YS mutation in eIF2beta allows translation to initiate at non-AUG codons, as defined by the ability of cells carrying an initiator codon mutation in the HIS4 mRNA to grow in the absence of histidine. The combination of this mutation with the (264)Ser-->Tyr alteration, a previously isolated suppressor of initiator codon mutations which has been shown to increase the spontaneous GTP hydrolysis in the ternary complex, caused a recessive lethality, suggesting additive defects. Thus the impaired interaction of these two subunits represents a novel type of defect in eIF2 function, providing in vivo evidence that the strength of interaction between eIF2beta and eIF2gamma defines the correct usage of the AUG codon for translation initiation.",

Liquid chromatography MS/MS analysis of peptides from proteins that co-precipitated with BIG1 antibodies identified \"kinesin family member 21A\" (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein that moves cargo on microtubules away from the microtubule-organizing center. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous proteins and microscopically apparent overlap of immunoreactive BIG1 with overexpressed GFP-KIF21A in the perinuclear region were consistent with an interaction of KIF21A-BIG1. Overexpression of full-length KIF21A and BIG1 and their fragments in HEK293 cells followed by reciprocal IP revealed that the C-terminal tail of KIF21A, with seven WD-40 repeats, may interact with structure in the C-terminal region of BIG1. Interfering with cyclic activation and inactivation of ARF1 by overexpressing constitutively active ARF1(Q71L) or dominant inactive ARF1(T31N) altered the distribution of BIG1 as well as its interaction with KIF21A. A requirement for ARF1 was confirmed by its selective depletion with siRNA. Unlike disruption of microtubules with nocodazole, selective inhibition of transport by depletion of KIF21A with specific siRNA altered BIG1 distribution without changing that of intrinsic Golgi membrane proteins. These newly recognized interactions of BIG1 and KIF21A should enable us to understand better the mechanisms through which, acting together, they may integrate local events in membrane trafficking with longer-range transport processes and to relate those processes to the diverse signaling and scaffold functions of BIG1.",

PIP5K\u03b3 90kDa (PIP5K\u03b390), an isoform of PIP5K, localizes to focal adhesions (FAs) and is activated via its interaction with the cytoskeletal protein, talin. Currently, regulatory signaling pathways of talin-PIP5K\u03b390 interaction related to FA dynamics and cell motility are not well understood. Considering the presence of Akt consensus motifs in PIP5K\u03b390, we examined a potential link of Akt activation to talin-PIP5K\u03b390 interaction. We found that Akt phosphorylated PIP5K\u03b390 specifically at serine 555 (S555) in vitro and in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-treated cells phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependently. EGF treatment suppressed talin-PIP5K\u03b390 interaction and PIP2 levels. Similarly, a phosphomimetic mutant (S555D), but not non-phosphorylatable mutant (S555A), of PIP5K\u03b390 had reduced talin binding affinity, lowered PIP2 levels, and was dislocated from FAs. The S555D mutant also caused decreases in actin stress fibers and vinculin-positive FAs. Moreover, assembly and disassembly of FAs were enhanced by S555D expression and EGF-induced cell migration was relatively low in S555A-expressing cells compared to wild-type-expressing cells. PIP5K\u03b387, a PIP5K\u03b3 splice variant lacking the talin binding motif, was phosphorylated by Akt, which, however, hardly affected PIP2 levels. Taken together, our results suggested that Akt-mediated PIP5K\u03b390 S555 phosphorylation is a novel regulatory point for talin binding to control PIP2 level at the FAs, thereby modulating FA dynamics and cell motility.",

We attempted to characterize the non-classical (non-vesicular) mode of FGF-1 release in the analyses using immunocytochemistry and immunoblot of conditioned medium (CM) from astrocytes. FGF-1 was completely released from astrocytes upon serum-deprivation stress in a Brefeldin A-insensitive manner. In the immunoprecipitation study using anti-FGF-1 IgG, S100A13 was identified to be the major protein co-eluted with FGF-1. The interaction between GST-FGF-1 and Strep-tag II-S100A13 was found to be Ca(2+)-sensitive, and to require the C-terminal 11 amino acid peptide sequence of S100A13. The overexpression of Delta88-98 mutant of S100A13 selectively inhibited the serum-deprivation stress-induced release of FGF-1, but not the release of S100A13 mutant from C6 glioma cells. However, amlexanox, anti-allergic drug whose target is S100A13, completely inhibited the stress-induced release of FGF-1 as well as S100A13. The stress-induced release of both proteins was also abolished by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca(2+) chelating agent. The serum-deprivation caused Ca(2+) spikes in omega-conotoxin GVIA and thapsigargin-sensitive manner. All these results suggest that S100A13 is a cargo molecule for the serum-deprivation stress-induced non-classical release of FGF-1, and that its driving force of protein-protein interaction and release is possibly mediated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) coupled to N-type Ca(2+) channel activity.",

To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of BZs on GABA receptors, we have been investigating structural determinants required for the actions of the BZ diazepam (dzp) on recombinant alpha1 beta2 gamma2 GABA(A) receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce point mutations into the alpha1 and gamma2 GABA(A) receptor subunits. Wild-type and mutant GABA(A) receptors were then expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells and studied using two-electrode voltage-clamp and ligand-binding techniques. With this approach, we identified two tyrosine residues on the alpha1 subunit (Tyr159 and Tyr209) that when mutated to serine, dramatically impaired modulation by dzp. The Y209S substitution resulted in a >7-fold increase in the EC50 for dzp, and the Y159S substitution nearly abolished dzp-mediated potentiation. Both of these mutations abolished binding of the high affinity BZ receptor antagonist [3H]Ro 15-1788 to GABA(A) receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. These tyrosine residues correspond to two tyrosines of the beta2 subunit (Tyr157 and Tyr205) previously postulated to form part of the GABA-binding site. Mutation of the corresponding tyrosine residues on the gamma2 subunit produced only a slight increase in the EC50 for dzp (approximately 2-fold) with no significant effect on the binding affinity of [3H]Ro 15-1788. These data suggest that Tyr159 and Tyr209 of the alpha1 subunit may be components of the BZ-binding site on alpha1 beta2 gamma2 GABA(A) receptors.",

The longest and most flexible loop in TNFalpha, also designated loop 3, is the only region that is not involved in intra- or intermolecular interactions and therefore constitute an attractive insertion site. However, the extension of the flexible loop by epitope insertions destabilized the TNFalpha molecule. Therefore, two cysteines were introduced to form a stabilizing disulfide bond between loops 2 and 3. In a second design approach, three TNFalpha monomers were linked by two T cell epitopes and expressed as a single chain TNFalpha trimer. TNFalpha variants that were expressed as soluble proteins also had a conserved tertiary structure, as determined by circular dichroism. The biological activity of the TNFalpha variants was of the same magnitude as human TNFalpha in cellular assays. Introduction of three separate single-point mutations (D143N, A145R, or Y87S) diminished the cytotoxicity of the mutated variants 50-800-fold compared with native TNFalpha.

Previously identified only in mammals, pim-1 cDNA was cloned and sequenced from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. The coding region of Xenopus pim-1 encoded a protein of 324 residues, which exhibited 64% amino acid identity with the full-length human cognate. Xenopus Pim-1 was expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and in COS cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that recombinant Pim-1 autophosphorylated on serine and threonine and to a more limited extent on tyrosine. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy was undertaken to locate these phosphorylation sites, and the primary autophosphorylation site of GST-Pim-1 was identified as Ser-190 with Thr-205 and Ser-4 being minor sites. Ser-190, which immediately follows the high conserved Asp-Phe-Gly motif in catalytic subdomain VII, is also featured in more than 20 other protein kinases. To evaluate the importance of the Ser-190 site on the phosphotransferase activity of Pim-1, Ser-190 was mutated to either alanine or glutamic acid, and the constructs were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and in COS cells. These mutants confirmed that Ser-190 is a major autophosphorylation site of Pim-1 and indicated that phosphorylation of Pim-1 on the Ser-190 residue may serve to activate this kinase.",

Coexpression of either one of the chemoattractant receptors with type II adenylyl cyclase in human embryonic kidney 293 cells allowed the corresponding chemotactic factor to stimulate cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. The chemoattractant-induced stimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase was absolutely dependent on the presence of GTP-bound alpha subunit of GS, as revealed by the coexpression of alpha s-Q227L, a constitutively activated mutant of alpha s. Stimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase by either fMLP or C5a was mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-like proteins, because the response was abrogated by the toxin. The ability of Gz (a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein that can couple to a number of Gi-linked receptors) to replace Gi in chemoattractant-induced stimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase was examined. The chemoattractant-induced response became insensitive to pertussis toxin upon coexpression of the alpha subunit of Gz. Interestingly, coexpression of alpha z significantly enhanced the chemotactic factor-stimulated type II adenylyl cyclase activities. When other G protein alpha subunits were tested under similar experimental conditions, all three forms of alpha 1 and alpha o1 were able to potentiate the fMLP response to various extents, whereas alpha q and alpha t slightly inhibited the fMLP response. The alpha subunit-mediated potentiation of the type II adenylyl cyclase response appears to reflect a productive coupling between alpha subunits and the fMLP receptor, because such enhancements were not seen with the constitutively activated alpha subunit mutants. Coexpression of the constitutively activated mutants of alpha z, alpha q, alpha 01, and alpha i1-3 neither enhanced nor inhibited the fMLP-stimulated cAMP accumulation. These results indicated that the observed enhancement of type II adenylyl cyclase responses was dependent on the ability of the wild-type alpha subunits to functionally interact with the fMLP receptor and that the fMLP receptor can couple to Gi1-3, Gz, and Go1 but not to Gs, Gq, or Gt.",

TRPV1 is expressed in sensory neurons and plays a critical role in pain associated with tissue injury, inflammation, and nerve lesions. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is coexpressed with TRPV1. It is activated by compounds that cause a burning sensation (e.g., mustard oil) and, indirectly, by components of the inflammatory milieu eliciting nociceptor excitation and pain hypersensitivity. Previous studies indicate an interaction of TRPV1 and TRPA1 signaling pathways. Here we sought to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions in nociceptive neurons. We first excluded physical interactions of both channels using radioligand binding studies. By microfluorimetry, electrophysiological experiments, cAMP measurements, and site-directed mutagenesis we found a sensitization of TRPV1 after TRPA1 stimulation with mustard oil in a calcium and cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. TRPA1 stimulation enhanced TRPV1 phosphorylation via the putative PKA phosphorylation site serine 116. We also detected calcium-sensitive increased TRPV1 activity after TRPA1 activation in dorsal root ganglion neurons. The inhibition of TRPA1 by HC-030031 (1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-N-[4-(1-methylethyl)phenyl]-2,6-dioxo-7H-purine-7-acetamide, 2-(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-7H-purin-7-yl)-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)acetamide) after its initial stimulation (and the calcium-insensitive TRPA1 mutant D477A) still showed increased capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity. This excludes a calcium-induced additive TRPA1 current after TRPV1 stimulation. Our study shows sensitization of TRPV1 via activation of TRPA1, which involves adenylyl cyclase, increased cAMP, subsequent translocation and activation of PKA, and phosphorylation of TRPV1 at PKA phosphorylation residues. This suggests that cross-sensitization of TRP channels contributes to enhanced pain sensitivity in inflamed tissues.",

Their expression, distribution, and protein-protein interaction affect lens development and fiber cell differentiation. Mutated crystallins lead to structural and functional changes of lens structure and could lead to opacity formation and cataract development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological effects of the cataract-causing G98R mutation on the alphaA-crystallin (CRYAA) protein and to test the capability of chemical chaperone trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) to reverse such effects. METHODS: Myc/His-tagged, human, full-length, wild-type (WT) or G98R CRYAA was expressed in human lens epithelial B3 cells and treated or not treated with TMAO. Triton X-100 (Tx) solubility and cellular localization of CRYAA were examined by western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence, respectively. Ubiquitin proteasome-associated degradation was assayed by MG132 treatment. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response, and apoptosis were analyzed by the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase-like ER-kinase, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), C/EBP homologous protein/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153), and caspase-3 and immunocytochemistry. Changes in heat shock and stress signaling were investigated. RESULTS: When transfected in lens epithelial B3 cells, unlike WT CRYAA located in the cytoplasm, the G98R CRYAA mutant formed aggregates inside the ER and the protein was predominantly Tx-insoluble. ER stress was induced by G98R CRYAA expression, and cells underwent apoptosis, as shown by a more frequent appearance of fragmented nuclei. Treatment with TMAO reduced Tx-insoluble mutant protein in time- and dose-dependent manners. Other chemical chaperones, 4-phenylbutyric acid, dimethysulfoxide, and glycerol, were much less effective than TMAO. ER-associated aggregates were reduced after TMAO treatment, and the protein was degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This alleviated ER stress and resulted in less apoptosis. Moreover, TMAO treatment induced a moderate upregulation of heat shock protein 70, indicating its effect on heat-shock response to modulate protein folding and assembly. No change was found for nontransfected cells after TMAO treatment. CONCLUSION: The natural osmolyte and chemical chaperone TMAO reduced the aggregation of G98R CRYAA. This alleviated ER stress and rescued the affected cells from apoptosis. Our results showed that the chemical chaperone reduces mutant CRYAA aggregates in lens cells. We suggest a potential chemical-based strategy to reduce lens opacity formation.",

This association, as with those of several other interacting proteins that have subsequently been identified, is mediated through the C-terminal tail of the PDZ domain partner. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we measured the thermodynamic binding parameters [changes in Gibbs free energy (DeltaG), enthalpy (DeltaH) and entropy (TDeltaS)] of the isolated PDZ10 domain for variable-length N-acetylated peptides from the 5HT2c serotonin receptor C-terminal sequence, as well as for octapeptides of eight other putative partner proteins of PDZ10 (5HT2a, hc-kit, hTapp1, mTapp2, TARP, NG2, claudin-1, and HPV-18 E6). In length dependence studies of the 5HT2c sequence, the maximal affinity of the peptides leveled off rapidly and further elongation did not significantly improve the dissociation constant (Kd) of 11 microM observed with the pentapeptide. Among the native partners of PDZ10, octapeptides derived from the hc-kit and 5HT2c proteins were the strongest binders, with Kd values of 5.2 and 8.5 microM, respectively. The heat capacity change (DeltaCp) for the 5HT2c octapeptide was determined to be -94 cal/mol, and a calculated estimate indicates burial of polar and apolar surface areas in equal measure upon ligand binding. Peptides with phosphoserine at either the P-1 or P-2 position experienced decreased affinity, which is in accord with the hypothesis that reversible phosphorylation is a possible mechanism for regulating PDZ domain-mediated interactions. Additionally, two conformationally constrained side chain-bridged cyclic peptide ligands were also designed, prepared, evaluated by ITC, and shown to bind PDZ10 primarily through a favorable change in entropy.",

Phosphorylation of serine 927 within the p105 PEST region by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex is required to promote p105 proteolysis in response to TNFalpha stimulation. In this study, the role of the p105 death domain (DD) in signal-induced p105 proteolysis is investigated. Endogenous p105 is shown to interact with the IKK complex in HeLa cells, and transient transfection experiments in 293 cells indicate that each of the catalytic components of the IKK complex, IKK1 and IKK2, can bind to p105. Interaction of p105 with both IKK1 and IKK2 is substantially reduced by deletion of the p105 DD or introduction of a specific point mutation (L841A) into the p105 DD homologous to the lpr mutation in Fas. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated p105 on serine 927 by purified recombinant IKK1 or IKK2 protein in vitro is dramatically reduced in both DD mutants relative to wild type. Furthermore, both of the DD mutations significantly impair the ability of low concentrations of IKK2 to induce p105 serine 927 phosphorylation and proteolysis in transiently transfected 3T3 cells. However, high levels of transiently expressed IKK2 bypass the requirement for the p105 DD to induce p105 serine 927 phosphorylation. Finally, p105 serine 927 phosphorylation by the endogenous IKK complex after TNFalpha stimulation and subsequent p105 proteolysis is blocked in both p105 DD mutants when stably expressed in HeLa cells. Thus, the p105 DD acts as a docking site for IKK, increasing its local concentration in the vicinity of the p105 PEST region and facilitating efficient serine 927 phosphorylation.",

The N-terminal sequence of the purified metalloproteinase was exclusively (204)EARR, indicating utilization of one of three furin recognition sites. Of many synthetic peptides tested as potential substrates, four peptides derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), Kit-ligand-1 (KL-1), tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine, and insulin B chain were cleaved by ADAM33; mutation at the catalytic site, E346A, inactivated catalytic activity. Cleavage of APP occurred at His(14)/Gln(15), not at the alpha-secretase site and was inefficient (k(cat)/K(m) (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(2) m(-1) s(-1)). Cleavage of a juxtamembrane KL-1 peptide occurred at a site used physiologically with a similar efficiency. Mutagenesis of KL-1 peptide substrate indicated that the P3, P2, P1, and P3' residues were critical for activity. In a transfected cell-based sheddase assay, ADAM33 functioned as a negative regulator of APP shedding and mediated some constitutive shedding of KL-1, which was not regulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation. ADAM33 activity was sensitive to several hydroxamate inhibitors (IK682, K(i) = 23 +/- 7 nm) and to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs). Activity was inhibited moderately by TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 and weakly inhibited by TIMP-2 but not by TIMP-1, a profile distinct from other ADAMs. The identification of ADAM33 peptide substrates, cellular activity, and a distinct inhibitor profile provide the basis for further functional studies of ADAM33.",

Here we describe the crystal structure of CadC(pd) (residues 188-512) solved at a resolution of 1.8 \u00c5 via multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) using a ReCl(6)(2-) derivative. CadC(pd) reveals a novel fold comprising two subdomains: an N-terminal subdomain dominated by a \u03b2-sheet in contact with three \u03b1-helices and a C-terminal subdomain formed by an eleven-membered \u03b1-helical bundle, which is oriented almost perpendicular to the helices in the first subdomain. Further to the native protein, crystal structures were also solved for its variants D471N and D471E, which show functionally different behavior in pH sensing. Interestingly, in the heavy metal derivative of CadC(pd) used for MAD phasing a ReCl(6)(2-) ion was found in a cavity located between the two subdomains. Amino acid side chains that coordinate this complex ion are conserved in CadC homologues from various bacterial species, suggesting a function of the cavity in the binding of cadaverine, which was supported by docking studies. Notably, CadC(pd) forms a homo-dimer in solution, which can be explained by an extended, albeit rather polar interface between two symmetry-related monomers in the crystal structure. The occurrence of several acidic residues in this region suggests protonation-dependent changes in the mode of dimerization, which could eventually trigger transcriptional activation by CadC in the bacterial cytoplasm.",

Direct CaM association with RyR2 is an important physiological regulator of cardiac muscle excitation-contraction coupling and defective CaM-RyR2 protein interaction has been reported in cases of heart failure. Recent genetic studies have identified CaM missense mutations in patients with a history of severe cardiac arrhythmogenic disorders that present divergent clinical features, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT syndrome (LQTS) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). Herein, we describe how two CPVT- (N54I & N98S) and three LQTS-associated (D96V, D130G & F142L) CaM mutations result in alteration of their biochemical and biophysical properties. Ca(2+)-binding studies indicate that the CPVT-associated CaM mutations, N54I & N98S, exhibit the same or a 3-fold reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity, respectively, versus wild-type CaM, whereas the LQTS-associated CaM mutants, D96V, D130G & F142L, display more profoundly reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity. In contrast, all five CaM mutations confer a disparate RyR2 interaction and modulation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding to RyR2, regardless of CPVT or LQTS association. Our findings suggest that the clinical presentation of CPVT or LQTS associated with these five CaM mutations may involve both altered intrinsic Ca(2+)-binding as well as defective interaction with RyR2.",

To create an \"active\" ARF, we constructed a point mutation in ARF1, Q71I, which was predicted to slow the rate of GTP hydrolysis. We demonstrate that Q71I, in contrast to wild type ARF1, exhibits a 2-3-fold increase in the half-life of ARF-GTP and is able to promote stable coatomer binding to Golgi membranes in the presence of GTP in vitro. Additionally, Q71I is able to support the binding of a significant amount of coatomer to membranes in the absence of added nucleotides, effectively bypassing the brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive exchange activity. Furthermore, transfection of cells with Q71I, but not ARF1, renders the Golgi association of coatomer resistant to the effects of BFA in vivo. These observations provide compelling evidence that ARF1 is a necessary GTP binding protein that regulates the reversible binding of coat proteins to Golgi membranes and that the effects of BFA on this process in living cells must be a consequence of BFA's inhibition of guanine nucleotide exchange onto ARF1.",

Through a variety of biophysical measurements, we show that a single alanine mutation at Tyr507 within the hydrophobic core of the isolated colicin E3 rRNase domain causes the enzyme to become an IDP (E3 rRNase(IDP)). E3 rRNase(IDP) binds stoichiometrically to Im3 and forms a structure that is essentially identical to the wild-type complex. However, binding of E3 rRNase(IDP) to Im3 is 4 orders of magnitude weaker than that of the folded rRNase, with thermodynamic parameters reflecting the disorder-to-order transition on forming the complex. Critically, pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the E3 rRNase(IDP)-Im3 complex demonstrates that the decrease in affinity is mostly accounted for by a drop in the electrostatically steered association rate. Our study shows that, notwithstanding the advantages intrinsic disorder brings to biological systems, this can come at severe kinetic and thermodynamic cost.",

Such coordination of intracellular E2:ER\u03b1-dependent signaling mechanisms is finely tuned by receptor association with specific partner proteins. Recently, we identified the leucine (L) 429 and alanine (A) 430 within the ER\u03b1 ligand binding domain as important residues for receptor non-covalent interaction to ubiquitinated species [i.e., ER\u03b1 ubiquitin-binding surface (ER\u03b1 UBS)] and for E2-induced ER\u03b1 activation. To date, if these two ER\u03b1 amino acids are involved in the control of E2-dependent pathways required for cell proliferation is unknown. Here, by using stably expressing ER\u03b1 mutated in L429 and A430 (i.e., L429A,A430G-LAAG) cell lines, we show that L429 and A430 are critical for E2-induced cell proliferation, PI3K/AKT pathway activation, and ER\u03b1-mediated transcriptional changes. Moreover, we demonstrate that these two receptor structural determinants direct the E2-induced PI3K/AKT/CREB1 pathway activation and CREB1-mediated transcriptional activity that in turn control the hormone-induced cell proliferation. As a whole, our data demonstrate for the first time that the ER\u03b1 UBS contributes to the modulation of E2-induced ER\u03b1-mediated cell proliferation and provide a novel connection between the receptor structure and the functional molecular mechanisms by which E2:ER\u03b1 complex can regulate cell processes.",

In humans, mutations in the mismatch repair genes hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1 and hPMS2 result in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) [1-8]. The hMSH2 (MSH for MutS homologue) protein forms a complex with a 160 kDa protein, and this heterodimer, hMutSalpha, has high affinity for a G/T mismatch [9,10]. Cell lines in which the 160 kDa subunit of hMutSalpha is mutated are specifically defective in the repair of base-base and single-nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatches [9,11]. Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae have suggested that MSH2 functions with either MSH3 or MSH6 in mismatch repair, and, in the absence of the latter two genes, MSH2 is inactive [12,13]. MSH6 encodes the yeast counterpart of the 160 kDa subunit of hMutSalpha [12,13]. As in humans, yeast MSH6 forms a complex with MSH2, and the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer binds a G/T mismatch [14]. Here, we find that MSH2 and MSH3 form another stable heterodimer, and we purify this heterodimer to near homogeneity. We show that MSH2-MSH3 has low affinity for a G/T mismatch but binds to insertion/deletion mismatches with high specificity, unlike MSH2-MSH6.",

Matriptase activates prostasin by cleaving in the amino-terminal pro-peptide region of prostasin, presumably at the Arg residue of position 44 (R44) of the full-length human prostasin. Using an Arg-to-Ala mutant (R44A) human prostasin, we showed in this report that the cleavage of prostasin by matriptase is at Arg44. This prostasin proteolytic activation site is also cleaved by hepsin (TMPRSS1) to produce active prostasin capable of forming a covalent complex with protease nexin 1 (PN-1). An amino-terminal truncation of EGFR in the extracellular domain (ECD) was observed when the receptor was co-expressed with hepsin. Hepsin and matriptase appear to cleave the EGFR ECD at different sites, while the hepsin cleavage is not affected by active prostasin, which enhances the matriptase cleavage of EGFR. Using hepsin as the prostasin-activating protease in cells co-transfected with EGFR, we showed that active prostasin does not cleave the EGFR ECD directly in the cellular context. Purified active prostasin also does not cleave purified EGFR. Hepsin cleavage of EGFR is not dependent on receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, while the hepsin-cleaved EGFR is phosphorylated at Tyr1068 and no longer responsive to EGF stimulation. The cleavage of EGFR by hepsin does not result in increased phosphorylation of the downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1/2), an event inducible by the matriptase-prostasin cleavage of EGFR. The role of hepsin serine protease should be considered in future studies of epithelial biology concerning matriptase, prostasin, and EGFR.",

On the other hand, PIPKI\u03b390 and the \u03b2-integrin tail compete for overlapping binding sites on talin. Enhanced PIPKI\u03b390-talin interaction suppresses talin binding to the \u03b2-integrin. It is unknown how PIPKI\u03b390 is removed from the PIPKI\u03b390-talin complex after on-site PIP2 production during cell migration. Here we show that PIPKI\u03b390 is a substrate for HECTD1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating cell migration. HECTD1 ubiquitinated PIPKI\u03b390 at lysine 97 and resulted in PIPKI\u03b390 degradation. Expression of the mutant PIPKI\u03b390(K97R) enhanced PIP2 and PIP3 production, inhibited FA assembly and disassembly and inhibited cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, mutation at tryptophan 647 abolished the inhibition of PIPKI\u03b390(K97R) on FA dynamics and partially rescued cancer cell migration and invasion. Thus, cycling PIPKI\u03b390 ubiquitylation by HECTD1 and consequent degradation remove PIPKI\u03b390 from talin after on-site PIP2 production, providing an essential regulatory mechanism for FA dynamics and cell migration.",

Upon stimulation, NPR-A receptors are activated to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and are subsequently desensitized through dephosphorylation of residues at their KHD. We used wild-type rat (r) NPR-A (WT) and a disulfide-bridged mutant (C423S) expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells to study receptor phosphorylation. We have previously characterized the C423S receptor as constitutively active and desensitized. At basal state, 32P incorporation in the rNPR-A(C423S) covalent dimer is about 24 times less efficient than incorporation in the WT rNPR-A. When membranes from WT and rNPR-A(C423S) are incubated with [35S]ATPgammaS, the mutant dimer receptor displays 3.5% of the thiophosphate incorporation found for WT rNPR-A. Since the rNPR-A(C423S) dimer is already extensively dephosphorylated, we then used the WT rNPR-A to study dephosphorylation. As previously documented, adding ANP globally induces time-dependent dephosphorylation of the receptor. However, in pulse-chase experiments with the WT rNPR-A, adding ANP during the chase does not lead to a significant effect on receptor dephosphorylation. On the other hand, thiophosphorylation of the WT rNPR-A previously desensitized with ANP is reduced to 8.3% of the incorporation for untreated receptor, similar to results found with the rNPR-A(C423S) at basal state. These results demonstrate that ANP-induced rNPR-A desensitization is modulated by a significant reduction in the activity or affinity of the rNPR-A kinase that contributes to the low phosphorylation level after induction. Moreover, we further document a close relationship between tight dimerization, dephosphorylation, and desensitization.",

The mutation Y220C, which occurs in approximately 75,000 new cancer cases per annum, creates a surface cavity that destabilizes the protein by 4 kcal/mol, at a site that is not functional. We have designed a series of binding molecules from an in silico analysis of the crystal structure using virtual screening and rational drug design. One of them, a carbazole derivative (PhiKan083), binds to the cavity with a dissociation constant of approximately 150 muM. It raises the melting temperature of the mutant and slows down its rate of denaturation. We have solved the crystal structure of the protein-PhiKan083 complex at 1.5-A resolution. The structure implicates key interactions between the protein and ligand and conformational changes that occur on binding, which will provide a basis for lead optimization.

In the present manuscript, we predict from structural modeling of pDED-HIPPI that R393 of HIPPI is important for such interaction. R393E mutation in pDED-HIPPI decreases the interaction with the putative promoter of caspase-1 in cells. Expression of caspase-1 is decreased in cells expressing mutant pDED-HIPPI in comparison to that observed in cells expressing wild type pDED-HIPPI. Using HIP-1 knocked down cells as well as over expressing HIP-1 with mutation at its nuclear localization signal and other deletion mutations, we demonstrate that translocation of HIPPI to the nucleus is mediated by HIP-1 for the increased expression of caspase-1. HIPPI-HIP-1 heterodimer is detected in cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus and is associated with transcription complex in cells.

It was first identified in the SAGA and NuA4 complexes, both with functions in multiple aspects of gene regulation and DNA repair, and recently found in the ASTRA complex. Tra1 belongs to the PIKK family of proteins with a C-terminal PI3K domain followed by a FATC domain. Previously we found that mutation of leucine to alanine at position 3733 in the FATC domain of Tra1 (tra1-L3733A) results in transcriptional changes and slow growth under conditions of stress. To further define the regulatory interactions of Tra1 we isolated extragenic suppressors of the tra1-L3733A allele. RESULTS: We screened for suppressors of the ethanol sensitivity caused by tra1-L3733A. Eleven extragenic recessive mutations, belonging to three complementation groups, were identified that partially suppressed a subset of the phenotypes caused by tra1-L3733A. Using whole genome sequencing we identified one of the mutations as an opal mutation at tryptophan 165 of UPF1/NAM7. Partial suppression of the transcriptional defect resulting from tra1-L3733A was observed at GAL10, but not at PHO5. Suppression was due to loss of nonsense mediated decay (NMD) since deletion of any one of the three NMD surveillance components (upf1/nam7, upf2/nmd2, or upf3) mediated the effect. Deletion of upf1 suppressed a second FATC domain mutation, tra1-F3744A, as well as a mutation to the PIK3 domain. In contrast, deletions of SAGA or NuA4 components were not suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a genetic interaction between TRA1 and genes of the NMD pathway. The suppression is specific for mutations in TRA1. Since NMD and Tra1 generally act reciprocally to control gene expression, and the FATC domain mutations do not directly affect NMD, we suggest that suppression occurs as the result of overlap and/or crosstalk in these two broad regulatory networks.",

Although tamoxifen does show some agonist activity in the presence of ERalpha, this stems from a distinct constitutive activation function (AF-1) that lies within the ERalpha N terminus. Previous studies identified a naturally occurring mutation (D351Y) that allows ERalpha to perceive tamoxifen and raloxifene as estrogens. Here, we examine the contributions of ERalpha activation functions to the D351Y phenotype. We find that the AF-2 function of ERalpha D351Y lacks detectable tamoxifen-dependent activity when tested in isolation but does synergize with AF-1 to allow enhanced tamoxifen response. Weak tamoxifen-dependent interactions between the ERalpha D351Y AF-2 function and GRIP1, a representative p160, can be detected in glutathione S-transferase binding assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity can be detected in the presence of ERalpha D351Y and high levels of overexpressed GRIP1. We therefore propose that the D351Y mutation allows weak tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity but that this activity is only detectable when AF-1 is strong, and AF-1 and AF-2 synergize, or when p160s are overexpressed. We discuss the possible structural basis of this effect.",

To evaluate the role of the beta subunit transmembrane domain in the insulin-dependent signalling mechanism, mutant human insulin receptors containing a series of nested transmembrane domain deletions (amino acids 941-945) were generated and stable Chinese hamster ovary-transfected cell lines were obtained. In addition, a substitution of Val-938 for Glu (E/V938) similar to the oncogenic mutation found in the neu transmembrane domain was also introduced into the insulin receptor. Scatchard analysis of insulin binding to the stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing either wild type or mutant insulin receptors indicated equivalent receptor number (2-4 x 10(6)/cell) and similar high affinity binding constants (Kd 0.1-0.3 nM). 125I-Insulin affinity cross-linking demonstrated that all of the expressed insulin receptors were assembled and processed into alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complexes. Surprisingly, all the mutant insulin receptors retained insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, endogenous substrate phosphorylation in vivo as well as insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA were unaffected by the transmembrane domain mutations. These data demonstrate that marked structural alterations in the insulin receptor transmembrane domain do not interfere with insulin-dependent signal transduction.",

We have recently shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation mediates high glucose (HG)-induced collagen I upregulation through PI3K-PKCbeta1-Akt signaling in mesangial cells (MC). Phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) interacts with activated growth factor receptors and activates classic PKC isoforms. We thus studied its role in HG-induced collagen I upregulation in MC. Primary rat MC were treated with HG (30 mM) or mannitol as osmotic control. Protein kinase activation was assessed by Western blotting and collagen I upregulation by Northern blotting. Diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin. HG treatment for 1 h led to PLCgamma1 membrane translocation and Y783 phosphorylation, both indicative of its activation. Mannitol was without effect. PLCgamma1 Y783 phosphorylation was also seen in cortex and glomeruli of diabetic rats. HG induced a physical association between EGFR and PLCgamma1 as identified by coimmunoprecipitation. PLCgamma1 activation required EGFR kinase activity since it was prevented by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or overexpression of kinase-inactive EGFR (K721A). Phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase inhibition also prevented PLCgamma1 activation. HG-induced Akt S473 phosphorylation, effected by PKCbeta1, was inhibited by the PLCgamma inhibitor U73122. PLCgamma1 inhibition or downregulation by small interference RNA also prevented HG-induced collagen I upregulation. Our results indicate that EGFR-PLCgamma1 signaling mediates HG-induced PKCbeta1-Akt activation and subsequent collagen I upregulation in MC. Inhibition of EGFR or PLCgamma1 may provide attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.",

Although asparagine residues in the pore-forming M2 regions of NR1 and NR2 subunits influence Mg2+ block, it has been speculated that additional residues are likely to be involved. Here, we report the unexpected finding that a tryptophan residue in the M2 region of NR2 subunits controls Mg2+ block. An NR2B(W607L) mutation abolished block and greatly increased permeation of extracellular Mg2+. A similar effect was seen with a mutation at the equivalent residue in NR2A but not with mutations at the equivalent residue or adjacent residues in NR1. In NR2B, mutations that changed NR2B(W607) to asparagine (W607N) or alanine (W607A) also greatly reduced Mg2+ block, whereas mutations that changed W607 to the aromatic residues tyrosine (W607Y) or phenylalanine (W607F) had little or no effect on Mg2+ block. Furthermore, the W607L, W607N, and W607A mutants, but not the W607Y and W607F mutants, decreased Ba2+ permeability of NMDA channels. Thus, residue NR2B(W607) may be involved in binding of divalent cations, in particular Mg2+, through a cation-pi interaction with the electron-rich aromatic ring of the tryptophan. We previously suggested that NR2B(W607) may contribute to the narrow constriction of the NMDA channel. A model is now proposed in which the M2 loop of NR2B is folded in such a way that NR2B(W607) is positioned at the narrow constriction, at a level similar to NR2B(N616) and NR1(N616), with these three residues forming a binding site for Mg2+.",

Of this family, HER2 does not bind growth factors and HER3 does not encode an active tyrosine kinase. This diversity creates difficulty in creating pan-specific therapeutic HER family inhibitors. We have identified single amino acid changes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER3 which create high affinity sequestration of the cognate ligands, and may be used as receptor decoys to downregulate aberrant HER family activity. In silico modeling and high throughput mutagenesis were utilized to identify receptor mutants with very high ligand binding activity. A single mutation (T15S; EGFR subdomain I) enhanced affinity for EGF (two-fold), TGF-alpha (twenty-six-fold), and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF (six-fold). This indicates that T15 is an important, previously undescribed, negative regulatory amino acid for EGFR ligand binding. Another mutation (Y246A; HER 3 subdomain II) enhanced neuregulin (NRG)1-beta binding eight-fold, probably by interfering with subdomain II-IV interactions. Further work revealed that the HER3 subunit of an EGFR:HER3 heterodimer suppresses EGFR ligand binding. Optimization required reversing this suppression by mutation of the EGFR tether domain (G564A; subdomain IV). This mutation resulted in enhanced ligand binding (EGF, ten-fold; TGF-alpha, thirty-four-fold; HB-EGF, seventeen-fold; NRG1-beta, thirty-one-fold). This increased ligand binding was reflected in improved inhibition of in vitro tumor cell proliferation and tumor suppression in a human non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model. In conclusion, amino acid substitutions were identified in the EGFR and HER3 ECDs that enhance ligand affinity, potentially enabling a pan-specific therapeutic approach for downregulating the HER family in cancer.",

Here we show that activation of MAP kinase by nerve growth factor involves two distinct pathways: the initial activation of MAP kinase requires the small G protein Ras, but its activation is sustained by the small G protein Rap1. Rap1 is activated by CRK adaptor proteins and the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor C3G, and forms a stable complex with B-Raf, an activator of MAP kinase. Rap1 is required for at least two indices of neuronal differentiation by nerve growth factor: electrical excitability and the induction of neuron-specific genes. We propose that the activation of Rap1 by C3G represents a common mechanism to induce sustained activation of the MAP kinase cascade in cells that express B-Raf.",

Furthermore, cross-linking of alpha4beta1 induced activation of the Rho family small GTPase Rac, which was enhanced by induced overexpression of CrkL and was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3(')-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. In addition, adhesion of 32D/EpoR-Wt cells to immobilized H-296, a recombinant fibronectin peptide specific for alpha4beta1, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), and the IL-3 receptor beta subunit as well as Pyk2, Shc, and Cbl. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and EpoR was also induced in a human leukemic cell line, UT-7, by adhesion to immobilized H-296. However, adhesion of 32D/EpoR-PM4 cells, expressing the W282R mutant EpoR defective in coupling with Jak2, to immobilized H-296 failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant EpoR. These results implicate CrkL in PI3K-dependent activation of Rac by outside-in signaling from alpha4beta1 and suggest that adhesion through alpha4beta1 further activates cytokine receptor-associated Jak2 to induce phosphorylation of these receptors.",

Binding of ICAM-1 to these receptors mediates leukocyte-adhesive functions in immune and inflammatory responses. In this report, we describe a cell-free assay using purified recombinant extracellular domains of LFA-1 and a dimeric immunoadhesin of ICAM-1. The binding of recombinant secreted LFA-1 to ICAM-1 is divalent cation dependent (Mg2+ and Mn2+ promote binding) and sensitive to inhibition by antibodies that block LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion, indicating that its conformation mimics that of LFA-1 on activated lymphocytes. We describe six novel anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies, two of which are function blocking. Thirty-five point mutants of the ICAM-1 immunoadhesin were generated and residues important for binding of monoclonal antibodies and purified LFA-1 were identified. Nineteen of these mutants bind recombinant LFA-1 equivalently to wild type. Sixteen mutants show a 66-2500-fold decrease in LFA-1 binding yet, with few exceptions, retain binding to the monoclonal antibodies. These mutants, along with modeling studies, define the LFA-1 binding site on ICAM-1 as residues E34, K39, M64, Y66, N68, and Q73, that are predicted to lie on the CDFG beta-sheet of the Ig fold. The mutant G32A also abrogates binding to LFA-1 while retaining binding to all of the antibodies, possibly indicating a direct interaction of this residue with LFA-1. These data have allowed the generation of a highly refined model of the LFA-1 binding site of ICAM-1.",

Deletion of this domain did not affect receptor subcellular localization although cells expressing this truncated form of the receptor failed to retain KDEL ligands intracellularly. Permeabilized cells incubated with ATP and GTP exhibited tubular processes-mediated redistribution from the Golgi area to the ER of the wild-type receptor, whereas the truncated form lacking the C-terminal domain remained concentrated in the Golgi. As revealed with a peptide-binding assay, this domain did not interact with both coatomer and ARF-GAP unless serine 209 was mutated to aspartic acid. In contrast, alanine replacement of serine 209 inhibited coatomer/ARF-GAP recruitment, receptor redistribution into the ER, and intracellular retention of KDEL ligands. Serine 209 was phosphorylated by both cytosolic and recombinant protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit. Inhibition of endogenous PKA activity with H89 blocked Golgi-ER transport of the native receptor but did not affect redistribution to the ER of a mutated form bearing aspartic acid at position 209.

In the complexes of serine proteases and their proteinaceous inhibitors, recognition is governed mainly by residue P1 in accord with primary serine protease specificity. The bifunctional soybean Bowman-Birk inhibitor (sBBI) should, therefore, interact at LysI16 (subdomain 1) with trypsin and at LeuI43 (subdomain 2) with chymotrypsin. In contrast with this prediction, a 2:1 assembly with trypsin was observed in solution and in the crystal structure of sBBI in complex with trypsin, determined at 2.3 A resolution by molecular replacement. Strikingly, P1LeuI43 of sBBI was fully embedded into the S(1) pocket of trypsin in contrast to primary specificity. The triple-stranded beta-hairpin unique to the BBI-family and the surface loops surrounding the active site of the enzyme formed a protein-protein-interface far extended beyond the primary contact region. Polar residues, hydrophilic bridges and weak hydrophobic contacts were predominant in subdomain 1, interacting specifically with trypsin. However, close hydrophobic contacts across the interface were characteristic of subdomain 2 reacting with both trypsin and chymotrypsin. A Met27Ile replacement shifted the ratio with trypsin to the predicted 1:1 ratio. Thus, the buried salt-bridge responsible for trypsin specificity was stabilised in a polar, and destabilized in a hydrophobic, environment. This may be used for adjusting the specificity of protease inhibitors for applications such as insecticides and cancer chemopreventive agents.",

This sequence is highly similar to the inhibitory site of the heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and to the autophosphorylation site in the hinge region of the PKA type II regulatory domain. A synthetic peptide that corresponds to the HCV sequence above and a set of shorter analogues act as competitive inhibitors of PKA. A 43.5-kDa fragment of NS3 that consists of residues 1189-1525 of the HCV polyprotein inhibits PKA in a similar range to the investigated synthetic peptides. In contrast to the short peptides, which show competitive inhibition, HCV-polyprotein-(1189-1525) influences PKA in a mixed-inhibition-type manner. A possible mechanism explaining these differences is the formation of complexes that consist of the protein substrate, the enzyme and the HCV-polyprotein-(1189-1525). Binding studies with PKA and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue [14C]fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine and [3H]cAMP do not reveal any influence of the short HCV-derived peptides or HCV-polyprotein-(1189-1525) upon the affinity of PKA for these nucleotides.

DHX33 knockdown decreased the association of Pol I with rDNA and caused a dramatic decrease in levels of rRNA synthesis.

In addition, an NTPase-defective DHX33 mutant (K94R) acted as a dominant negative mutant, inhibiting endogenous rRNA synthesis. Moreover, DHX33 deficiency in primary human fibroblasts triggered a nucleolar p53 stress response, resulting in an attenuation of proliferation.

Our results showed that following exposure to SPE B or G308S, the levels of IL-8 protein and mRNA were increased and the increase was inhibited by the addition of anti-Fas antibody, suggesting that the increased production of IL-8 by SPE B is mediated through Fas receptor. In the presence of G308S, the association of FADD and procaspase 8, and activation of NF-kappaB were also detected. The application of siRNA of FADD and of procaspase 8 could inhibit the NF-kappaB activity. The proteolytic activity of caspase 8 was required for the NF-kappaB activity. Further studies showed that G308S could increase the phosphorylation of ERK and the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus, and the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation decreased the IL-8 production, mRNA expression and activation of NF-kappaB. In addition, siRNA of procaspase 8 could inhibit the G308S-induced cleavage of MEKK1, binding of MEKK1 to caspase 8, activation of ERK and the NF-kappaB activity.

The Parkinson's disease genes pink1 and parkin, which encode a mitochondrially targeted protein kinase, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, respectively, participate in a key mitochondrial quality-control pathway that eliminates damaged mitochondria. In the current study, we established an in vivo PINK1/Parkin-induced photoreceptor neuron degeneration model in Drosophila with the aim of dissecting the PINK1/Parkin pathway in detail. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we identified Serine 346 as the sole autophosphorylation site of Drosophila PINK1 and found that substitution of Serine 346 to Alanine completely abolished the PINK1 autophosphorylation. Disruption of either PINK1 or Parkin phosphorylation impaired the PINK1/Parkin pathway, and the degeneration phenotype of photoreceptor neurons was obviously alleviated. Phosphorylation of PINK1 is not only required for the PINK1-mediated mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin but also induces its kinase activity toward Parkin. In contrast, phosphorylation of Parkin by PINK1 is dispensable for its translocation but required for its activation. Moreover, substitution with autophosphorylation-deficient PINK1 failed to rescue pink1 null mutant phenotypes. Taken together, our findings suggest that autophosphorylation of PINK1 is essential for the mitochondrial translocation of Parkin and for subsequent phosphorylation and activation of Parkin.",

Although the function of alpha-synuclein remains largely unknown, recent studies have demonstrated that this protein can interact with phospholipids. To address the role of alpha-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease, we have investigated whether it binds phospholipase D (PLD) and affects PLD activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells overexpressing wild type alpha-synuclein or the mutant forms of alpha-synuclein (A53T, A30P) associated with Parkinson's disease. Tyrosine phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein appears to play a modulatory role in the inhibition of PLD, because mutation of Tyr(125) to Phe slightly increases inhibitory effect of alpha-synuclein on PLD activity. Treatment with pervanadate or phorbol myristate acetate inhibits PLD more in HEK 293 cells overexpressing alpha-synuclein than in control cells. Binding of alpha-synuclein to PLD requires phox and pleckstrin homology domain of PLD and the amphipathic repeat region and non-Abeta component of alpha-synuclein. Although biologically important, co-transfection studies indicate that the interaction of alpha-synuclein with PLD does not influence the tendency of alpha-synuclein to form pathological inclusions. These results suggest that the association of alpha-synuclein with PLD, and modulation of PLD activity, is biologically important, but PLD does not appear to play an essential role in the pathophysiology of alpha-synuclein.",

On the basis of this result, an engineered disulfide bond was designed to constrain the alpha5 helix of Galpha(i1) into its EPR-measured receptor-associated conformation through the introduction of cysteines at position 56 in the alpha1 helix and position 333 in the alpha5 helix (I56C/Q333C Galpha(i1)). A functional mimetic of the EPR-measured alpha5 helix dipole movement upon receptor association was additionally created by introduction of a positive charge at the amino terminus of this helix, D328R Galpha(i1). Both proteins exhibit a dramatically elevated level of basal nucleotide exchange. The 2.9 A resolution crystal structure of I56C/Q333C Galpha(i1) in complex with GDP-AlF(4)(-) reveals the shift of the alpha5 helix toward the guanine nucleotide binding site that is anticipated by EPR measurements. The structure of the I56C/Q333C Galpha(i1) subunit further revealed altered positions for the switch regions and throughout the Galpha(i1) subunit, accompanied by significantly elevated crystallographic temperature factors. Combined with previous evidence in the literature, the structural analysis supports the critical role of electrostatics of the alpha5 helix dipole and overall conformational variability during nucleotide release.",

          "text": "Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) interferes with host cell signaling by injecting virulence effector proteins into enterocytes via a type III secretion system (T3SS). NleB1 is a novel T3SS glycosyltransferase effector from EPEC that transfers a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety in an N-glycosidic linkage to Arg(117) of the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD). GlcNAcylation of FADD prevents the assembly of the canonical death-inducing signaling complex and inhibits Fas ligand (FasL)-induced cell death. Apart from the DXD catalytic motif of NleB1, little is known about other functional sites in the enzyme. In the present study, members of a library of 22 random transposon-based, in-frame, linker insertion mutants of NleB1 were tested for their ability to block caspase-8 activation in response to FasL during EPEC infection. Immunoblot analysis of caspase-8 cleavage showed that 17 mutant derivatives of NleB1, including the catalytic DXD mutant, did not inhibit caspase-8 activation. Regions of interest around the insertion sites with multiple or single amino acid substitutions were examined further. Coimmunoprecipitation studies of 34 site-directed mutants showed that the NleB1 derivatives with the E253A, Y219A, and PILN(63-66)AAAA (in which the PILN motif from residues 63 to 66 was changed to AAAA) mutations bound to but did not GlcNAcylate FADD. A further mutant derivative, the PDG(236-238)AAA mutant, did not bind to or GlcNAcylate FADD. Infection of mice with the EPEC-like mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium expressing NleBE253A and NleBY219A showed that these strains were attenuated, indicating the importance of residues E253 and Y219 in NleB1 virulence in vivo In summary, we identified new amino acid residues critical for NleB1 activity and confirmed that these are required for the virulence function of NleB1.",

IL-6 and IL-11 induce gp130 homodimerization whereas the others lead to the formation of heterodimers with LIFR or OSMR. Binding epitopes for IL-6 and IL-11 are located in the immunoglobulin-like domain and the cytokine binding module (CBM). Here we show that a gp130 mutant lacking domain 1, although unresponsive to IL-6 and IL-11, can still activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors in response to LIF or OSM. Moreover, point mutations in the CBM of gp130 (F191E and V252D) that severely impair signal transduction in response to IL-6 and IL-11 differentially interfere with gp130 activation in response to LIF and OSM. Thus, epitopes involved in gp130 homodimerization are distinct from those leading to the formation of gp130/LIFR or gp130/OSMR heterodimers. These findings may serve as the base for rational design of gp130 antagonists that specifically interfere with bioactivity of distinct IL-6-type cytokines.",

The type specificity requirement for HN or H protein coexpression strongly suggests that an interaction between HN and F proteins is required for fusion, and studies of chimeric HN proteins have implicated the membrane-proximal ectodomain in this interaction. Using biotin-labeled peptides with sequences of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) F protein heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain, we detected a specific interaction with amino acids 124 to 152 from the NDV HN protein. Biotin-labeled HR2 peptides bound to glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing these HN protein sequences but not to GST or to GST containing HN protein sequences corresponding to amino acids 49 to 118. To verify the functional significance of the interaction, two point mutations in the HN protein gene, I133L and L140A, were made individually by site-specific mutagenesis to produce two mutant proteins. These mutations inhibited the fusion promotion activities of the proteins without significantly affecting their surface expression, attachment activities, or neuraminidase activities. Furthermore, these changes in the sequence of amino acids 124 to 152 in the GST-HN fusion protein that bound HR2 peptides affected the binding of the peptides. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HN protein binds to the F protein HR2 domain, an interaction important for the fusion promotion activity of the HN protein.",
